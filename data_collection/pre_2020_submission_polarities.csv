ei5r99,1577812766,"hey, so recently because of winter break, I've spent most of my time inside my house, also meaning I've had open access to the kitchen cabinet. I've had a conflicting relationship with food and weight for a few years now, I won't let myself eat during school hours even if it hurts, but when I'm at home, I'll eat as much as i want even if I'm not feeling hungry. Sometimes I'll eat so much that it hurts; to a point where vomit starts to burn my throat without me forcing it out. I don't purge, but sometimes I want to puke because I've eaten so much that it hurts. In the beginning of the break I weighed 112 lb , but now I'm all the way up to 115 lb (BMI 19.5). I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but i look in the mirror and it shows, I want to have a flat stomach, I want to feel healthy, but all the food my family buys is filled with carbs, and we barely have any fruits and vegetables in the house. Me and my mom are going shopping for better food, but I use food as a distraction. Do ya'll have any ways of distracting yourselves when your sad or bored, any ways other than food.

ei0kw5,1577783708,"I am in such a tough spot right now. A lot has happened in the past 3 months with myself and my dad (personal matters) that have really taken a toll on my mental health. I had never seen my dad take mental health days until these past 3 months occurred and I wish there was more I could do to help him. 

On top of all my personal issues, I got screwed over by my university for the 7th time once again delaying my graduation to where I have to take a whole extra year to get my bachelors. My eating was slowly starting to get better, but now none of us can afford health insurance so I currently can't see doctors or specialists. I do get free counseling on campus, but they don't specialize in eating disorders. I went from eating 1/2 a meal a day at home to consistently eating 1-2 meals a day on campus despite my hectic schedule. I know that's amazing especially since it's so hard to eat on campus and lugging everything to the kitchen downstairs where someone may or may not be using it is a huge challenge, so I tend not to cook on campus.

I just don't know why when it comes to being home, my eating habits are worse. I have now gone from eating 2 meals a day consistently to eating 1 meal a day. I have binge-eating disorder and I have managed to only fill my dorm with snacks that I have that won't trigger my IBS and that I won't feel guilty snacking on because they are in some regard healthier than what I could be snacking on. 

I guess to top off the stress, I have no idea what I want to do with my life still or what I should be doing with it and I'm in my 8th out of 9th year of college right now. I feel as though I should have really honed what I want to do at this point so I could start applying to remote jobs (my skillset allows for me to work from home and not in an office space which I really don't like). Should I choose to move out within the year, getting a remote job would be ideal since I do have someone I could rent a house with and I won't have a car for a while due to paying off debt. 

I have spent the majority of my last few years just lost and depressed and anxious about everything. I don't know where to begin anymore or what questions to ask or even to get myself out of bed for that matter. Do I need to move out? Would it be more beneficial to my mental health to move out? The worst part about thinking about moving out is that I feel like I'm abandoning my family as I have a sibling with cerebral palsy. I kind of feel like I'd be walking out on them in a way. I love my family don't get my wrong, but my mother and I butt heads all the time and it's really frustrating and anxiety inducing for me.

I feel like I'm just rambling at this point. For a TLDR: I'm not eating well when I should be at home and it was harder to eat on campus. On campus I managed to begin maintaining at least 2 meals a day instead of 1/2 or 1 meal a day. I have a lot of stressors and feel really lost and just don't know what to do anymore.

Hi everyone, I'm 23M/EDNOS/C and on a throwaway account; Ive had an ed for around 3-4 years, diagnosed 2 years ago. Since diagnosis I've done okay and, while underweight, I managed to stop trying to lose more. 

About 4 months ago I started a PhD and with the stress I've already gotten worse than I ever had been before, and now my weight is low enough that I'm worried about my physical health - bmi down from [16.3](#s) to [14.2](#s) so far. 

My main problem is eating enough times during the day [usually only once](#s), and making the meals large enough when cooking/preparing - I can usually convince myself to finish whatever I make, given enough time. 

Has anyone got any advice on how to increase my food intake without noticing much / without much conscious thought as to what I'm doing?

Thanks in advance for any advice :)

(Notes: 

* My family doesn't know about my eating disorder, and I don't live with them

* My PhD supervisor and research group don't know, I think they would be helpful and supportive but I work in a very small field where every researcher knows most of the others so I'd ideally not let them know as I'd like to do post-doctoral research with one of them and would rather keep that private

eh9y3a,1577646520,"**Hey, just a small disclaimer, I know treatment is different from country to country, so, I live in Norway, so I'm sure experiences from a Scandinavian/ northern countries would probably be more likely to concern me. I'm also an adult.**

\-------------------

**Short summon of sickness history**, ^(might have a saying in your estimated reply.) *\[Feel free to skip if lazy lol\]*

So, I've struggled with overeating/ under-eating my whole life. I started developing a restrictive ED back in my teens, and managed to get back on my feet with the help of a meal plan and threats from my at that time doc to inform parents and hospitalize me if I didn't. I wasn't too deep into it so it went pretty ok.

Not gonna go into what happened because I probably have a irrational fear of someone finding out who this is lol. But something very dramatic happened in life, and I started binge in my late teens/ early adulthood. Got obese. Was obnoxious to my binge ED.

Almost a year ago now I relapsed heavily on my restrictive and purging ED. I have periods of up to weeks at a time where I B/P 2-4 times a day at an average, but its been up to 7. I have also vomited a bit blood at least one time.

Then it shifts to restrictive/ fasting that lasts 1-2 weeks.

**TW NUMBERS:**

^(For reference, bit over a half year ago, my BMI was 31,2. Today it is 19,6. My mom tries to convince me that I'm underweight but, not rly according to my BMI. Yeah, she weights more, but she's taller, and have more mussel mass, she still has a smaller fat percentage. Anyways, I digress.) 

^(I've lost about 2-4 kg a month.) 

**Some other physical symptoms I have**, is hair loss, I can see I have acid damage on my tongue, teeth etc. This swings a bit but I have periods of days where I feel so heavy I can barely get out of bed, or change positions. Stomach pains comes and goes, dizziness and tunnel vision every time I stand up. Haven't feinted yet though. Easily agitated. Sometimes my heart rate drops to around 40, and I think my blood pressure might be low as well. Feeling cold frequently even when its 20 degrees in my home, and I'm wearing pj's, 2-3 pair of socks, 2 carpets and covers. I sometimes get a lot of death anxiety, feeling paranoid. Having struggles to go into the store, or even into my kitchen with the lights on. Having to weight myself 10-20 times a day. Lol, just writing this makes me understand its kind of bad. 

Last night, I tried to fight my B/P urges, and they just grew and grew until I couldn't anymore, ended up having to leave my home at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night to buy shit to B/P on, even though I was paranoid AF of getting mugged or assaulted or what's worse.

But I'm still not underweight, but I might be in 1-2 moths if it continues in this speed idk.

\------------------------------

**My questions:**

**^(So, I'm finally going to be evaluated for impatience over new years. And I'm nervous. I've been to multiple different facilities multiple times, for other reasons. And it hasn't rly helped me at all, and I haven't had a good experience.)**

**^(This place isn't an ED only clinic, but they're much more specialized than anywhere else nearby. I also haven't been at this place before so, I suppose, I'm both hopeful and scared. The problem is that, they only take in one patient at a time with an ED. Which I understand, because its a competitive disorder, and I'm kinda happy they don't. So, my questions, I know people don't have a set answer, but getting estimated answer, or guesses even, might calm my nerves, because I feel like I have to know what I'm going into, this is also because I have so many other problems stacked on top of it, and I have earlier almost gotten sectioned because I handled the stay very badly, because of set other problems.)**

**1: If you read my sickness history, the BMI stuff and the other physical symptoms, even though I'm not technically underweight, yet(?), when do you think I would be prioritized? If at all? Is my problems still big enough to get help, or get it within a set amount of time? I'm sure there's probably a lot of people that are sicker than me and need help more urgently. Like, I'm not even underweight, will they still take me seriously? I'm rly scared that they'll judge me because I'm not sick enough, or think I'm faking it. Sometimes I even ask myself that question, until I'm hanging over the toiled bowl again that is...** ^(I'm just so exhausted of this crap and I just want to get a life...)

**2: If I were to get help. How long, on en estimate from minimum to maximum do you think I'd have to stay there? Again, this would probably be easier to answer if you're from my general area, and have read the post over.. How long do you think they would want to keep me there? And how long do you think it would take for me to at least get back on my feet so I can work more on it at home? I do want to cooperate as good as I can even though I find it difficult.** ^(I just feel so stuck in it at this point, it controls every aspect of my woke life, and I can't get out of it on my own..)",-0.4380357022243594,eating_disorders

eg71la,1577425067,"TW: abuse mention, numbers (calories). It's a long one, sorry.

Other than a few-days lapse about two years ago, I've been free of this shit for almost 5 years.

Then some nasty PTSD triggering happened (long story short, my stepdad--former sexual abuser--got sick, been having to help my mother with him, he has early stage dementia and made a grossly sexual comment at me and touched my ass) a few weeks ago. I saw him again at Christmas but didn't say anything to him, which was fine, huge family so nobody noticed.

I'm in therapy for PTSD/depression/anxiety. I'm getting the help. I'll be restarting meds after the first of the year. I work in mental health, for God's sake, I know the coping skills. I'm working with my therapist on reducing contact with my mother and her husband (I can't cut contact, which is a story for another day).

But I've been extra anxious lately. And when I'm really anxious I get sick to my stomach and my appetite tanks and I forget to eat, maybe a small meal a day. (Was the reduced appetite from anxiety the cause of, or a result of, my ED? Chicken or the egg, the world may never know)

I realize I'm getting about 900 cal a day, half of it in coffee creamer. And the scale is dropping. And then I start drinking a little less coffee and a little more diet coke. And then if I eat more than 300 calories in a stretch I feel an overwhelming urge to purge it. I haven't, so far. I've been good on that front.

Y'all. I see the train wreck coming but can't step off the fucking tracks.

 I just can't make myself want to eat. It's not like it was way back when, obsession over my body and the numbers and all of that. I respect my body. It's a good, strong tool. It's made *people*. I don't want to be the weak shell I used to be.

I've got kids now, like I mentioned. I don't want them to see the heartache and drama and agony that goes with this. I don't want to tell them that Mommy can't play because she's too tired. I don't want them to notice that I'm not eating.

And I'm starting fucking grad school in two weeks. How the fuck do I handle that if I can't get my stupid brain to focus?

I'll be mentioning this to my therapist at my next appointment. Probably. It's honestly really embarrassing. I should have more self control than this.

I’ve researched and tried everything under the sun to motivate, encourage, and support him — aside from an intervention or driving him to the door step of a residential facility. I suffer from clinical depression, so I know there’s a delicate balance to supporting/encouraging.  I have to be patient. However, now I’m a little scared.

He went from never exercising to running 5 or more miles every day and changing his eating habits completely. At first, I thought it was a healthy step toward handling his depression. But now, at 5’7, he barely weighs 110lbs. He sometimes forgets to eat. He’s now strictly vegan. 

He will tell me he’s only eaten a granola bar all day, etc. I stocked his fridge with easy, protein-filled snacks and food to help. But I don’t think it’s helping. 

He doesn’t seem healthy at all and I don’t know what to do. I feel like he may shut down and isolate himself if I approach this directly or in the wrong way. 

Can you help me with advice on what to do? What helped you seek treatment? 

Am I too close to him and need someone else to talk to him? He has lost almost all of his close friends over the last year because of his tendency to isolate and push others away. The only person he talks to regularly is his gym partner, who may be encouraging these habits.

I'm pretty sure everything started when I was 9. We moved across the country for my dad to get a MBA, He was so busy he basically wasn't there. Then My mom had some very serious health issues that almost cost her life. In short a lot of stress, almost no support, and I needed a way to cope.

Things got really bad last fall once I started eating lettuce and pickles for lunch and restricting. This time last year I got really depressed (I have times of depression caused by my ed) and my mental health steadily declined until June of this year, when I ended up in the ER (depression related) After my ER stay and a lot of therapy my mental well being got a lot better. I started learning coping skills for reducing my anxiety, and my depression.  I don't really know how my ED doing during this time because I didn't think I had one.

Recently I realized I was doing a really good job following the definition of an anorexic. So I decided to get better. I started reintroducing foods, stopped restricting to meal times, and was making progress. And I felt Great, I was doing more, feeling better, had less pain, happier and really progressing on my mental health.  Then this last Wednesday came around. First a little context. I had a YT channel I posted on a lot a year or two ago, I told my family and it got up to 400 subs (big family(jk)). Recently I came out to my parents as bi, I also decided to come out on YT since others videos had helped so much. I forgot my uncle had sub'd and he saw it. The following conversation was good and supportive but it still caused a relapse.

So currently I'm restricting, depressed, super anxious, and weak like I'm going to pass out.

My goal is to get though Christmas happy and not drained.

Anyway this is what I'm going though. I'm going to try to get though the holidays and then talk to my parents so they aren't worried.

First of all, sorry if this is not the place to seek advice, but I'm overwhelmed and I can't talk about this with my parents or friends.

I'm having a very important exam in a week, but the only thing I can think of is binging because of the stress. I've been restricting for months after my last relapse, but I never had this much pressure on myself. This week is also the week before my 'period' so PMS might have something to do, and it's also the week before a very sad day that triggers my suicidal ideation so my feelings are all over the place and... well, I can't focus on my exam.

I was thinking of raising my intake, but I'm really scared and I feel like trying something this radical on such an emotional week is not going to help.

I went to the gym everyday, logged my food (eating at least 1600 calories), and had a great relationship with food. Then the depression hit and the 30 lbs I lost was gained back in about 6 months and ever since the beginning of 2019 I have been struggling with food. I started college at the beginning of September and honestly my bingning has spiraled ever since. I eat til I’m ill almost every day and then wake the next day and tell my self I’m not going to eat and instead fast for the whole day to make up for everything I ate the day before. It’s a vicious, exhausting cycle with a few weeks in between where I seem to have control again, then lose it and start the cycle again. Tonight, I felt especially horrible after my binge and decided to make myself throw it all back up. The issue is that the purging made it feel so much better and made me feel almost calm? I know it is so terrible for me and I would have never expected to be the person who this would happen to. I just don’t know where to turn because it feels like the only way to gain control is by throwing it back up. :( anyways that’s my rant and I’m sorry if it made no sense.

So I'm financial secure the rest of my life, and I won't be forced into work, school or any activity that would literally kill me this is a rly good thing...  But honestly, I never rly expected this,  I always just thought that if I die from my ed, then oh well, at least I didn't have to make the choice to kms.

I've never in my whole entire life even been able to imagine a possible and manageable future for myself, and now for the first time ever, I do...

But now I'm more stuck in my ED than ever before, and I have no clue how to get out. I've tried more or less anything and everything. And been told by my mental health team that ""they cant help me before I myself admit that I need it, and ask for it""

So, after a long time, and lot of courage, I just managed to break through the barrer and ask for an inpatient stay. Because if I'm realistic about it, I need help to get back on my feet at this point, so I can work on it at home..  The thing is, I have all these other problems on top of it, so I need all this ""special treatment"" or a very individualized plan, just so that it may be manageable for me to even just be there.

But apparently, the most specialized plan I could get apparently is that I can eat alone in my room, if they can trust me not to purge afterwards, which basically is the reason I want to go inpatient. If I'm completely alone there too, with access to a toilet, OF COURSE I'll fucking purge...

And then they also said that after meals I could join them in the living-room if I feel stressed. Like bro, after 2 years of getting to know me, and my problems, and you still haven't gotten it in your brains that I have crippling anxiety, avpd, Asperger, I have literally NO tolerance for stress anymore, just 5 min can lead to a complete meltdown. And they expect me to sit in the LIVING-ROOM, with A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE, with all of this AND being stressed after eating?

The whole fucking point of going inpatient and get help in the first place is literally gone. 

On top of that, the mental health team I've seen hasn't helped at all the last what, 2 yrs?  Its just 2 boomers seeing me once a week. I'm sure they don't have more than High-School education and ofc, work experience with being nurses and taking a few courses. 

90% of the time I've seen them, I've always just felt more frustrated afterwards because they have low asf IQ, and they make it out as if they know so much about what they do, but in reality, some of the things that comes out of their mouths just confirms that they have no competence, and that they barely know me at all after all this time. 

I had actually already thought about quit seeing them after going inpatient, and when I know I could safely work on myself on my own with the help of my family, but, now I don't even see a point in waiting and going inpatient first. 

So I guess I'll just talk to them about quitting next week.

My mom will join my next doctors appointment next week. Not rly looking forward to it, since I've seen my doc on my own since I was like 14, (almost 21 now), and I don't even know if I can manage being in the same room during it all cuz its so difficult. But I understand that its necessary, and I might have to since I'm over 16...

If my doc doesn't have any better treatment options, that is actually helpful AND manageable, then I guess I'll just quit all treatment together, and just focus on myself, and my family, and I guess just get comfortable with the thought that it probably will kill me sooner or later, or I kms when I can't take it anymore.

Maybe by focusing on myself and my family and things that gives my life meaning for once, maybe my eating disorder could go over by itself, but I can't really count on it.

At least I don't want to waste more time on pointless shit and being frustrated about not getting help or being understood, or managing to get better on my own. 

I've already wasted almost 21 yrs on just, trauma, family tragedies, being mentally and physically and chronically ill. I just want a life, and I'll take whatever I can get, if my only life is one without being able to eat, but still to some extent enjoy spending time with my family and enjoy them a few more years, then I guess that's what I'm gonna do.

But honestly, I'm not gonna pay 35 EUR a week over new year on them asking me what my BMI is (With no good reason to know it other than just them being nosy and curious) and talking to a psychiatrist FOR me with me NOT EVEN BEING there, and them forcing folders with information about MY diagnosis that I've lived with for years/ my entire life and probably know more about than both them AND their folders do. 

And them reading cringe-worthy unhelpful book quotes and them saying ""it gets better"" and comparing my situation to other people they've spoken to before, as if I'm just a ware and not a person of my own. Just for themselves to feel better when they know they're incompetent to help me and just wants to keep their job.

It doesn't help. 

And them not even helping me setting up a plan, or coping skills, or even refer me to someone or somewhere that CAN help. like, why even bother??

I honestly just want to close this chapter of my life, and not think too much about my past anymore, and just focus on the now. It just this fucking ED that's ruining it all for me.

I can live with anxiety, avpd, Asperger, scoliosis, depression, IBS and the list continues, now when I know I'm financially secure, and I can just focus on as I said, my health, things that gives me joy, and my family, which is my biggest anchor and reason that I'm alive today. 

But this ED just isolates me even from my family, and any event, and I can't even enjoy food, which I used to, and in a complicated way still love...

My only three wishes in life is, that my little family and I have long, stable and as joyful lives we can after everything that has happened. And that we stay as close as we are now for many years to come.

That I could get myself a permanent home, maybe look into some kind of service dog or something in the future. Maybe even get a partner or re-connect more with old friends I haven't seen in a long time.

And being able to fucking eat, and enjoy a fucking burger again, without purging, getting anxiety, feeling shame, having to excersize and cry and having meltdowns. To just, invite my sister on sleep-overs and we could make tacos again, or enjoying a barbecue with my grandma, or what ever. And have a healthy relationship, not binge on shit food and become obese again..",-0.4176193809379242,eating_disorders

Im a male but any advice is appreciated :)",-0.4673309247637812,eating_disorders
e7zo45,1575840011,"I'm sorry I know I am not supposed to ask for a diagnosis here and that is not really my intention. I want to know if I should be concerned about my health and if I should bring this issue up with my therapist.

I am going to therapy for trauma related disorders and I've noticed that my therapist is always asking me about my weight and eating habits. Finally one session she asked me if I think I am anorexic.

I said no and also said that anorexics probably might night realize they are anorexic (not sure if that is true) so I just asked her what she thinks. She didn't give me a definite answer I guess she still is unsure...

Anyway I have notice my health and body more after that incident and I am afraid that maybe I do have an eating disorder.

Some things I do or have noticed about myself:

1. My hair is falling out a lot. I haven't been able to shower as much because I'm too busy with exams so I blamed the fallout on this.
2. I feel relieved if I end up so busy that I can skip a meal.
3. I feel almost angry if I have to eat out with friends, especially if its a type of food I banned from my home cooking.
4. When I look in the mirror my body looks the same, but when I step on a scale or even touch my own body (like my ribs) it feels different.
5. I lose weight after I think I've been eating too much.
6. I do not feel hungry. Its annoying and I have to do my best to keep track of the time to know when to eat.
7. I wouldn't say I have self esteem issues about my body; rather that I don't care.
8. I do get kind of triggered if I see images of fit girls or weight loss ads on the internet.
9. Everyone keeps commenting on how skinny I am. I don't think it makes me feel good; I'm indifferent.
10. I feel tired and have body aches/headaches all the time.
11. I hate eating in front of people and get offended if someone takes an interest in what I am eating.

If I do have an eating disorder than it makes total sense considering things that happened in my past. Anyway I am not looking for a diagnosis only if any of you can relate and if I should be concerned.

To be honest I don't believe I have one but looking at the evidence I have to be logical here...

e7oclm,1575774786,I want to get straight to the point. I have this problem where I eat around 1500 calories a day for 4 days a week and then for 3 days a week I will binge very hard to the point where I will eat around 4000 to 5000 calories a day for three days. What kind of health effects would this have? Would I be getting really fat over the 3 day high calorie period and then my body would just be praying for food the other days or what else might happen concerning internal diseases.

e6k1j3,1575565337,"Last night, I cried a little before getting in the shower with my boyfriend because I didn't want him to see what I've become. As if he hasn't. Then he initiated sex and I went with it because I've been dismissive of his needs. We decide to finish showering and finish this afterwards.

Got back to it a bit later in the living room, but had to move to the bed because the futon ""wasn't built for this and might break"" (we've successfully fucked on that thing many times in the past...). 

Go to the bed, switch up positions, and I hear the fat slaps starting and turned to cry into the bed. He's getting tired and I know I should get on top to finish, but my tears have welled up and began to fall out of my eyes. I can't let him see these, I can't talk about this right now, I'm mortified. I successfully hide my tears and distress. He says we can take a break. 

He leaves the bedroom and I try to gather myself, pretending to look for my shirt to lag behind a bit. I heat up my tea, blow my nose, wipe away the few more tears that escaped my eyes, and go back to the futon with him. We don't cuddle like we were before. He eventually falls asleep, laying on the opposite side (so feet to feet). My thighs in the foreground of my view, I stare at him, amazed he's put up with me for so long and disgusted in myself for the unintentional cruelty. Denying him sex and intimacy because I can't let go of myself for one moment. 

He admitted a few weeks ago how guilty he feels because I haven't orgasmed in a while. I know he can't hear me despite my efforts to explain it has nothing to do with him, the quality of sex, or my attraction to him. It is simply that the thought of orgasming is laughable, this disgusting body isn't worthy of achieving/recieving such pleasure because I'm too aware of its inability to truly reciprocate.

 This is the background info on what I do and what I think: I constantly worry about gaining weight and staying in shape.  I used to be a long distance runner in college so I like the idea of functional fitness; because of that I try to be ""active"" everyday of the week. Being active consists of lifting 5 days a week with running on most days. I hate the feeling of being ""full""(bulge in the stomach). I feel weird when I feel ""full""(bulge in the stomach) and feel that people can tell when I've had a lot to eat and I don't look my best when I eat a lot. I do not purge regularly but I purge about \~4 times every 2 months. I avoid unhealthy foods (processed foods, meat, dairy). I feel guilty/disgusting after eating pretty much any amount of sweets.  I think maybe my ""fear"" of gaining weight is just wanting to stay healthy and not have health issues when I'm older. 

Personally I think I just have an unhealthy relationship with food and low self-esteem in terms of my body image. But if I am aware of this does that make it an issue?

It has been 2 years (and many doctors) without an answer so I am investigating every corner.

One thing I've thought is that anorexia could have caused some damage to the girl's body.  I have read [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932925](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28932925) which suggests anorexia could cause hepatitis in some.

I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas of a disease that severe anorexia could bring to someone that can be sexually transmitted.  I have no ill will toward the girl, I am just looking for an answer.",-0.5086861173128068,eating_disorders

I am recovering from restrictive eating and I’m seeing a dietian and therapist. Because my dietian has been making me eat 3x more then I was I’ve gained some weight. She told me the weight was temporary but it’s been 2 months now and it’s not going anywhere. It’s making me super depressed and I feel myself wanting to go back into my old ways because it seemed to be working before. I’ve told this to both my therapist and dietian but they always brush it off or when I ask my dietian how can I safely lose weight she just starts talking about how it’s normal for our bodies to change at this age and that we need to learn to accept it. But I can’t accept it. I may not look “fat” to most people but I’m much heavier then I used to be and my goal weight is not under weight it’s just average for my height (right now I feel like I’m on the edge of being average weight/over weight). I’m so frustrated that I can’t get any guidance from them over this. Also I try to work out but because I’m so depressed about my body it takes everything in me to make it to the gym or off the couch after work so if I’m lucky I’ll only go twice a week. It’s also triggering for me to go to the gym sometimes when I see really fit and beautiful people. I just don’t know what to do.

dz1pv9,1574254684,"I grew up very skinny. I was smaller than everyone on the football team, and I was always the skinny emo kid. I was always underweight, but I ate enough food. I wasn't self-conscious of it until my guardian would force me to drink protein shakes and eat protein bars before leaving the house. She'd make me sit at the table and eat fries and milkshakes before I could go to bed. She was always making comments about how gross it was.

I live in southern US, so of course a lot of people here are very big. I know it's linked to poverty, but it's insane how EVERYONE here is usually very large. I would constantly get ""chicken legs"" or ""you need to eat a cheeseburger"" comments. I felt emasculated and have been called a ""faggot"" my whole life for looking the way I do. I graduated high school at like 110 lbs, 6'1"". I ate junk food all the time. I ate all the time.

I didn't gain weight until I hit 23. I finally hit 160. I saw candid photos of myself and saw that my legs were thicker, shoulders (biggest insecurity) were wider, etc. I fell in love with my body. I was growing a beard and finally felt like a man, and not a twink anymore. Three months or so pass and I'm at 190. I'm trying on clothes at TJ Maxx and my gut is hanging over and I can barely breathe as I'm bending over. Now I was fat as fuck. A couple months later I shaved my beard to see what I'd look like, because it had been a while. I saw how big my double chin was. I used to have a chiseled jaw and was told I was ""model material"", but I had become what looked like what women call a neckbeard, without the beard. I grew my beard back out and ignored it. A year later I started to really lift weights so I could obtain the ""strongman"" look and embrace my stature. I did this for several months, and started seeing a girl I had a crush on for years. I was driving to Ohio to see her every weekend. The first time I visited her, I was so focused on her that I honestly forgot to eat for three days. I didn't even think about being hungry. After I noticed this, I realized it was pretty easy to just not eat. I dropped 15 lbs pretty fast. I was going to the gym a lot still, and my girlfriend and I were having very frequent sex. I was no longer out of breath while doing so, and I honestly think it helped me lose weight, being cardio and all. I stopped eating so much, and I watched myself drop 50 lbs over the course of a month or so.

A few months went by and she started acting weird. I could not eat. I didn't even feel the need to eat. She eventually dumped me, and I went like a week or a week and a half without eating. I dropped my weight fast, and got down to 155. I started taking photos of myself and I looked amazing. Most of my gut was gone, legs looked pretty again, etc. I was no longer a ""fat fuck"". But I shaved my beard and my neck was kinda still there. I started doing the ""neck exercise"" again where you motion like you're kissing the ceiling, but I still feel gross. I'm up to 160 again. I'm constantly going to the gym and weighing myself. I'm not lifting weights as I don't have the energy or drive to do it anymore. I'm constantly covering my neck. My gut still feels gross when I sit down. I know, I know. ""Everybody's looks like that when they sit down!"" Well I used to not feel disgusting.  


I'm also lactose intolerant and addicted to drinking milk so I shit my brains out. I gave myself hemorrhoids this way a month ago but they're gone. However, I've noticed that it helps.

I love food way too much. It's not the pangs that bother me, it's not tasting food. I've considered tasting it and spitting it back out but haven't gone that far, yet. It's very difficult for me to throw up, so I just don't eat. I'm going insane over here. It's all I think about. I see pictures of me three years ago and my jaw looked so nice.

He hasn't talked about it much but I can tell he's upset that his dad didn't talk to him sooner about it. My boyfriend is very tall and is skinny but not alarmingly skinny. In the beginning if our relationship he would mention things like oh I havnt eaten at all today or I don't think I ate yesterday. Today he opened up a little bit more. He explained that he has been feeding and buying food for himself since he was a junior in highschool (he's now 20).

He said he was 140 when he graduated high school and is now 128. He's 6'1ft tall btw. He is also a smoker now. So I guess my question is: would this be considered an eating disorder?

I need help. I had some issues with my eating in high school and got help and was doing pretty good until college started. I restrict to cope with anxiety and to punish myself for whatever I feel like I've done even slightly wrong. I'm worried that I'm close to being in a dangerous spot but I'm not sure. I'm 21 F with a height of 5' 4"" and weighing 103 lbs. I can eat two toaster waffles and feel satisfied for most of the day. If I try to eat more than a few bites of a proper meal, I'll feel overly full and on the verge of getting sick. I'm pretty sure the only reason that I'm above 100 lbs is because of a medication I'm on that has a side effect of weight gain (which is why I wanted that specific one, i wanted to fill out more and look less like a stick person) but my body cant support the weight. I think if I were to lose it I could function a bit better at work (I take food to people's seats at a small movie theater) but as it stands right now, I run one order out and by the time I'm back in the kitchen I'm tired and I need to sit. Even just standing can feel exhausting. I had a bit if a flare up of anxiety this morning where my heart started racing and i dont think my body could supply the energy for it to do that and i felt no matter how deeply i breathed i couldnt get enough oxygen. I'm still feeling like i cant get air and I'm laying down just typing this out on my phone. I'm probably dehydrated too. My boyfriend has been trying to help me eat and I feel like a disappointment when I cant eat just those few bites like he's been asking me to for a half hour. My mom said she cant do it again (referring to the major issues I had in high school with my mental health) and I dont want to hurt her again. The last thing she needs right now is the stress of me in a hospital bed and her feeling like a failure because she couldnt help me even though she couldnt have done much anyway. I feel like im letting everyone in my world down right now with my failing classes and failure to eat but I dont know what else to do right now. What I'm trying to say is how long do I have to make a change before I end up hospitalized?


TL;DR- I can eat like max 2 or 3 toaster waffles and feel full for most of the day. I'm prob dehydrated too. I'm 5' 4"" and 103 only because a medication prevents me from losing more weight.

Between what she says and what I can tell, her eating disorder seems to be triggered by anxiety. She has no time or headspace for herself. Big family, very dependent bf and full time job in in customer service where she's alone and has to tend personally to each client.

She can't bring herself to stomach much more than coffee. Once she eats something, she wants to puke it up. I feel like suggesting something like ensure, but I also have never dealt with this situation and don't want to overstep boundaries.

I've always had a sweet tooth since i was little, i was living with my grandparents 98% of my life so they treated me well with food and sweets. Ive never been into shape, my whole life i body shamed myself because i never looked my best. When i was around 16-17 years old i kinda stop eating that much i was skinny.. but not fit. i truly didn't feel hungry. At that time my ex-boyfriend literally after 3 weeks of dating, got a pretty bad rare disorder ""Galenbare"" i thinks it called this but not sure.. i stopped eating i was under so much stress, cuz you know one day you see a person perfectly healty and the next they they cant walk, talk and do anything by themselves. He broke up with me because he didn't want me to feel bad for him and yeah( he is better and healthier now tho).
So yeah , a year later i found my current boyfriend and then everything started to go downhill with my eating. Im not sure exactly when it strarted (my binge period) but i remember smoking quite a lot of weed and i was everything an enormous amount of food when i was high. Everything tasted so good and in a year i reached my highest weight 64kg. Which is not a lot but i was chubby and i felt gross. At the beginning of 2019 in April i decided to start working on my body weight . For 4 months i was doing Intermittent Fasting and it worked i lost around 5kg without changing my diet. then when i saw the results but i stopped losing weight any more, i moved to something more extreme Keto Diet. I knew it will be a change, because of my obsession with carbohydrates ..but i wanted to challenge myself just to see what will happen. I was doing great the first 2 weeks, i was eating a lot less, because fats made me full for 4 hours and in just 2 weeks i lost 4kg. i was so proud of myself. Until my life became a mess, me and my boyfriend got thrown out in the middle of the night from our landlord, accusing us for not paying 1 month rent a 1 and half ago .. we slept 2 week in a strangers house(a friend of our friend) me and my boyfriend lost our jobs, we just started a new more stressful one, we moved into a new place, we didn't have furniture, we were starting 2nd year university.. and we didn't got paid by our last employer.. so yes it was kinda an amazing experience. The 2 weeks spend into the strangers houce, i didn't cook i felt uncomfortable to do it.. so my Keto diet was over.. and you could imagine what happened.. i gained everything back ... 7kg in to months.. 
The worst part is i documented my weight loss journey on social media (Instagram) people loved my results they were proud... after what happened i stopped using my instagram i was and still am ashamed of myself..  I don't look in the mirror i don't take pictures i don't even look at my body while im taking a shower... I only feel shame, i don't feel good about my body, i dont like my legs, bottom and belly... 
Im trying so hard to stop my binge eating but it is so difficult, i start my day feeling ready to change my diet i eat a nice good salad or smoothie and after that i just buy myself 10 donuts and eat them just to feel full .. The speed im eating them is crazy literally after 15 minutes they are gone and am hungry again.. i feel like i want to make myself sick.. Sometimes after my binge period i just want to throw up everything just to take the guilt out of my shoulders. And im starting to think more and more about throwing up because i don't think i can ever stop overeating... i would never feel satisfied after meal ..
What do you suggest?
Any tips, any idea what to do ? 
Should i buy appetite suppressant?
Should i see a doctor about that?

I have a problem with binge eating and I occasionally purge but I don’t consider myself bulimic. I don’t want to lose weight, I’m actually very insecure about how underweight I am and i want to gain weight but sometimes I’ll purge just so I can free up stomach space to fit more food. I don’t make myself throw up often (haven’t done it since July of 2018!) but I’ll do things like deliberately eat or drink things that trigger my IBS and make me.. eh, *void my bowels* quite dramatically to make room. I just can’t do anything without mindlessly eating and sometimes I’m too full to eat so I make room. 

Would this be considered bulimia? Or am I just an enthusiastic binge eater? Not asking for a diagnosis obviously but just wanted to see other people’s opinions on it. Thanks.",-0.7387214027770972,eating_disorders

dwprkp,1573819031,"Apologies if this is messy, I'm just writing down everything I can think of.  
I just want to vent since I have no one close to talk to about this. Although I accidentally told my sister and her fiancé when we were high about a month ago and after that we haven't talked about it, I'm happy that they haven't brought it up but honestly I don't think they have because they don't know how to tackle it. I want to tell someone, and I want to talk more to my sister about it but I'm afraid that they'll try to ""control"" me, or just because I've told them they think I want to recover and they'll want to help.

I've always had a ""normal"" weight, but I've never liked how huge my hips looked, and I couldn't wear a high waist skirt and not think about how much it showed how big my hips were, and I think my hips are the main reason for this.

I've had an on and off relationship with (undiagnosed) anorexia since I was about 16. In high school I almost lived on water during school hours due to my depression, about one year after high school I lived in a folk high school and I started to purge from time to time, two years later I moved into my first apartment and bought a lot of diet suppliments and weight loss powders.   
But it has never been as serious as now, one and a half years after moving into my apartment, before I just half-assed everything and ""relapsed"" into eating normal every time. Now I'm counting every calorie and I'm having weight-ins every morning and night, writing down the weight every time.  
This time it all started at the start of this year with me getting a gym membership to actually get healthy (I sit in front of my computer a lot), then I wanted to restrict on chips and candy to feel even healthier (I have a huge sweet tooth), then I bought a scale and realised that I weighted way more than I thought I did (When I still lived at home I would weigh myself just because and I'd always be 5kgs/11lbs up and down, being just above underweight).

It just became a downward spiral from there, I started tracking *every* calorie I consumed, I started fasting, I never ate past 7pm, I purged when I binged. 

Today I woke up and realised I was officially underweight, and I want to keep going, but at the same time I want to start eating healthy and excersise and *really* have a healthy body, but knowing how many calories there are in everything terrifies me.  
I'm moving in with my boyfriend in two weeks and my plan is to lose as much weight as I can until then and after that start eating good and excersise. I want to make a good transition, but I'm afraid that it won't work mentally or that he'll find out or that I'll have to tell him. I don't know, I might come with an update in about two weeks.

I have barely eaten in the past 4 days (coffee is a meal 💜) and it feels so good. I cant believe I forgot how good it was to feel empty and light and kind of free and have a little bit more free time that was previously consumed by making food and eating.

When I was restricting I know o would get angry if someone took my food because I would have it planned out. Now that I'm """"EaTiNg NoRmAl""""  I still get super cranky about my food. My biggest example is with my boyfriend, sometimes we'll go out to eat, he claims hes not as hungry and gets maybe a small thing whole I get something a little bigger. Once hes done I offer him some of mine because he says he's still hungry, but then takes more afterwards. I've never been one to deny food to anyone so I never say anything, either to him or to people who help themselves to my food, I'm fully aware its irrational and kind of fucked up to be angry about someone eating food even after I've offered but it still makes me mad. Today I came home after a long anxious day and started bawling because I realized my boyfriend ate a frozen pizza that I had been saving for a while. I was never explicit that I wanted it, and I bought it during our shopping trip so it was clear it was for both of us/ whoever wanted it. We dont separate food, i just felt so sad and angry about it.

So I have this friend.  Very good life long friend.  She is over weight, having gained weight consistently since we were in high school, and then after university more, then lost some, then gained some, and most recently lost some.  I don't think her weight has anything to do with it. But worth mentioning she does have weight issues, and she does have self confidence issues, and is overweight currently.  Over the years her table/eating habits have gotten worse and worse.  She is basically ""grossed"" out by food.  But she loves food.  She loves cooking and talking about food etc.  But when we sit down for a meal.... she sits there looking grossed out, makes weird noises, is in utter disgust, pushes food around her plate, or nibbles it in tiny bits making yuk groans.  She never finishes her plate, having a meal with her is basically super uncomfortable, because she looks like she is in total torture.  It wasn't this bad when we were in high school, but started around university and got worse and worse.  I used to think it was just when she came to my house to eat because she didn't like our food.  But then I noticed it was everywhere.  I'm a pretty picky eater, so I just don't put foods I don't like on my plate, but I sit down, eat and I'm done.  But it does actually irk me out to be sitting across the table from someone who is picking at their food and making noises, and taking a bite and than taking food OUT of their mouth.

dqt431,1572740996,"Before anyone tells me to seek professional help, I am. I have a doctors appointment next week, I’ve just been thinking about this a lot and need to write it out and get it out of my head. It’s probably gonna be pretty long too so I understand if you just skim or something.

Background: 
I am 18 years old, female, pretty average in every way. The one thing that has made me stand out my whole life is that I’m skinny. Everyone always commented about it. Right now I’m 5’5ish and around 100lbs. I have toothpick legs and spaghetti noddle arms and barely an ounce of fat on my body. This has become my identity, it’s how people recognize me, it’s just me. I am fully aware that this is not healthy and I could gain a few pounds, but the thought of even gaining 5-10 pounds and losing my skinny identity is really scary to me. I don’t look at myself and think I’m fat or disgusting, I don’t starve myself, I don’t binge and purge. I don’t have any of the typical eating disorder symptoms. It’s just the fear of gaining weight and losing such a big part of my identity. 

More recently:
These past few months have brought a lot of change (mostly adjusting to college) and with that, newfound anxiety. I’ve been struggling with it since August and I haven’t really had anything done about it because I kept telling myself it would go away on it’s own. Well, it hasn’t, and ow it’s starting to physically affect me. That’s a whole different story, but the eating part is what concerns me. I’ve always been a really picky eater and not a huge eater. I mostly only ate for survival. I never really saw the enjoyment in food that other people saw. I would get hungry, and I’d eat. That was all. Since August, I haven’t had any appetite. I’d go days eating basically nothing because I just wasn’t hungry or the thought of eating made me sick. Occasionally I’d feel physically starving and have to force myself to eat. It’s gotten a little better this last month and I started eating again. 

Why I’m concerned about this now:
Thursday morning, I ate breakfast as usual, Thursday day, I ate minimal snacks (college schedule doesn’t leave time for a proper lunch, so I snack), Thursday night, I get in my first, minor car accident on my way home, no injuries, but it kickstarted my anxiety again. Thursday night I was just so stressed and anxious after the accident, and it was late, so I went straight to bed without eating. Friday morning, I woke up starving, so I went to eat. While I was waiting for my breakfast to cook, I get faint and dizzy. Long story short, I end up on the floor in my room, with a killer headache and a giant bruise on my face, completely disoriented, and terrified. My mom calls the doctor, they say to have the ambulance come, ambulance comes, all my vitals are fine but my blood sugar is 60. Which is way too low. They tell me to go to the ER to make sure I didn’t damage my head at all. It was all fine, but blood sugar was still way too low. They tell my I’m probably hypoglycemic and after doing some research,  I think I have been all my life. Easy fix is to just eat, right? Well for whatever reason, I can’t. And that’s why I’m wondering if the stuff I explained earlier is an eating disorder. Again, I am going to a doctor in a few weeks but I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and how you got through it or if it is a sign of an eating disorder or just any advice.

dps98o,1572548887,"Hello!
So, wow, where to start?
I've been in a very well known clinic for 6months getting threament for BPD and severe bulimia and trichotillomania. I got my BPD diagnosed years ago, stopped cutting myself when I was 18 and instead became anorexic, then bulimic. I was on the edge of dying many times. I stole food from grocery stores and friends, lost my job, couldn't pay my rent anymore due to all the ones I spent on my binge food.

Finally this year I decided to give my recovery another try. Tbh I didn't believe I would get anywhere, like becoming 'clean' for a lost case like me was just impossible.

However. It worked. It took 6 months for me to get better but I'm OK now. OK with the weight I have gained. OK with the unwanted but actually cute pixie cut I have now. I don't binge anymore and I can take part in social happenings without asking myself all the time when can I finally fucking binge again?
This clinic really helped me save me from myself and learn to understand, accept and yes, eventually love myself.

However, next week I'll leave. It's time. I understand that I need to leave and pick up the threads of my old life again eventhough I'm impossible scared. Scared I might not make it.
It feels like.. I'm being abandoned again. I can't stay here. This is no longer a save place for me. But I don't want it to feel like that. I want to leave in peace with my mind and the memory of my time here..
Today, I went shopping for binge food again.i ate. I purged. I picked out a lot of my hair and it makes me so insanely frustrated because it took so long for my hair to look as OK as it does now.

I am 22 (F), 5'7"" , currently weighing a healthy 120 lbs, and I am in my last year of university. 

My ED reached its peak when I was 16-18, in my senior year of highschool.  In the midst of academic stress, a toxic relationship, insecurity, extreme body dysmorphia and just general depression, I found comfort in my ADHD meds that promised hunger suppression - It was such a relief, ""FINALLY"", I thought , ""something I can control"".

 At 17 I started to restrict my eating and I dropped 20 lbs in less than two months, finally weighing 95 lbs. I couldn't see myself clearly. I would always see my skinny friends as significantly skinnier than me and looking back, at pictures from that time, it is obvious that I was significantly skinnier than all of them.

How did I get passed this? I moved and went to University. I found great friends and an environment that I THRIVED in. I was finally in control of so many aspects of my life.

Or so I thought...

**I think that I felt like I had rid myself of the disorder because I made so much progress so quickly.** 

I still subconsciously seek comfort in the ""appetite suppressant"" side effects of my meds during times of stress, like during midterm season or during finals. It's like it's my safety blanket when I feel out of control.

I recently realized that the only reason that I allow myself to not care about what I eat (especially during the summer) is because I rely on my Adderall to give me those boundaries. During the summer, when i'm generally medication-free, I drink and eat what I want and gain more weight than I am comfortable with. The thoughts that go through my mind during those times are along these lines: "" Don't worry, you'll get back on your medication. With Adderall's help, you'll go on a fast for a few days, and all of this will go away. It's just temporary, you can get rid of it. You've done it before"". Then I continue to laugh with my friend, seemingly care-free. But i'm not care-free, am i? My weight does stress me out. I do think about it all the time. 

Sometimes, I find myself missing my ED...

I genuinely thought that I was passed this, simply because I chose to ignore the signs since they aren't  ""as bad"" as they once were.

What do you guys think? Am i still in it?

I've been doing alright the past 2 years or so but when my depression gets bad, I tend to relapse in small waves but I quickly recover from it. 

Recently its been different. A lot of heavy shit was going on and I stopped eating for days at a time. One of my friends noticed and has been trying to help and it's been tough. I was fine for a little while but this month really hit me like a train. A week or two ago I hadn't eaten much but it was still enough for me to feel disgusting and I started purging again. It kinda spiraled, and since then I've been throwing up everything I eat. it feels like an endless cycle because I'll try to actually eat but I end up right back in the bathroom puking it up. I know I need to stop and get help but I cant stop. Even if I was open with my family or school counselor I doubt they would take it seriously because I'm overweight. That was the problem when my ed first started, I was getting comments about being healthier and looking better so when I tried to tell someone they refused to believe me. 

My best friend is the only one who knows what's going on and shes really worried but I can't stop. I really don't know what to do.",-0.465555066977826,eating_disorders

dmy43z,1572013195,"Hi!

I'm looking for someone who is successfully recovered, is in the process of recovering, or is getting geared up for recovery (basically, anyone not currently in a pro-ed mindset) who would like to be and would like to have a support buddy, and who doesn't mind communicating through WhatsApp or another messenger app. 

I am familiar with inpatient and outpatient treatments, many types of therapy, and many, many self-help programs and books (Brain Over Binge, multiple Recovery Workbooks, AA/OA, etc.) - you name it, I've probably tried it. And I am open to talking about and/or learning about any kind of therapy/program/belief system/etc. that there could possibly be. I want to support you through your journey, and I want you to be there to support mine - in whatever form and for however long that takes.

I am not attending meetings for it, but I have been working through the twelve steps of OA (overeaters anonymous). I've come face to face with step 5; admitting our wrongs to god, ourselves, and another human being. Oof. Can we skip that step? No. I'm determined to recover and this is the way I'm gonna do it. I just need the human being. Part of OA is finding a ""sponsor"" to support you through the rest of the steps and your recovery process. My buddy does not need to be part of OA, does not need to believe in God, does not need to know the twelve steps - none of that. If you do or are interested, great - that's a bonus. But if not, that's good too! I will not push my beliefs on you, I will not push the program on you, I will not put propaganda in your face. If you believe in a god, or whatever - that's great! If not, thats good too! I don't know what I believe in yet - I'm working on that. But I do, at the very least, believe in a Good.Orderly.Direction - meaning that I have the power, somewhere within me, to carry out the ""next good thing"" (the power to make and act out the right decision for me, in each moment). All I ask is that you have an open mind, try to respect my beliefs (whatever they end up being), and agree to equally considerate with yours (we can totally discusss them, and whatever else you like, but please keep your kool-aid in your own cup). 

My end goal is to quit my bulimic behaviours; \*\*no\*\* purging, \*\*no\*\* secret eating, and no \*\*need\*\* to binge. I'm taking this one day at a time, sometimes one minute at a time. I have cut down from purging 3-4 times/day to once/day, my next goal is to go a full day without purging (TODAY IS THE DAY! ...please...). I would like for us to be able to talk each other through binge urges (when both available), share feelings/thoughts/dreams/goals, and basically just be there for each other.

i've developed my eating disorder in the beginning of my puberty so my breasts didn't even had a chance to grow.. i've took the birth control pill, but that hasn't done anything to my boobs. I've lost my periode for like a few years and since i'm taking maca powder, my periode comes slowly back. i was never that underweighted, but maybe my body thinks otherwise. So i always wanted big boobs, ALWAYS (even in the darkest days of my anorexia). But i would never do a plastic surgery... I was in recovery 2 years ago and i was at normal weight, but i trained my ass off in the fitness studio, so maybe this is the reason why i didn't gained breast even tough i ate normally. But maybe i have small boobs no matter how much i gain weight??? :'(((( that would be horrible...

so i'm abusing a daily medication since half a year to lose weight  (i've actually started that medication to go cold turkey with an other medication and i haven't planned to contuine it after, but i've noticed that i'm losing weight and i was dumb enough to contuine it because of that reason) and i've never imagined to say this but i will try to stop taking it  to start my recovery again with other conditions... and maybe that sounds dumb, but i'm also trying to stop the medication because i want to get a curvy body and maybe grow some boobs...

so i'm asking... i'm 21 years old. is there a possibility that i will magically grow breasts when i gain weight while i recover even tough i'm over my puberty? and is there maybe anyone who had a  A cup (i didn't even wear a bra because it makes no sense) and got a bigger breast after recovering or gaining weight? is there hope?

some other tips to grow bigger boobs naturally? i know that maca powder and fennel tea helps...some other experiences?",-0.0865876544719399,eating_disorders

Sometimes, when I feel horrible(most of the time) I take a pair of scissors and lightly snip the very surface skin of my stomach.
Every night, it is a rule for me to go to bed hungry.
It's not that I don't eat at all, I just eat a little less.
I have quarter cup of oatmeal for breakfast, half a fruit for mid snack, cuz I don't want anyone in my class to think that I'm starving/dieting, even though many have asked me already. I eat half of what my mom packs for lunch, and sometimes, I skip the mid snack and eat that fruit for lunch.

I’ve kinda always been this way, like since I was nine or ten, I would think I was overweight and needed to loose weight.  I thought that this was normal, that everyone felt so awfully about themselves that they would skip meals and just exercise instead.  At first, it was light dieting and exercise, but then, when I was about 12, I started skipping school lunch and got into competitive dancing and gymnastics .  Practices 
were longer and more frequent, which meant less time being around food.  This made me feel great about myself, I was visibly skinnier and hiding the fact that I didn’t eat well.  Then my friends started to catch on, and pointed out that I wasn’t eating, I would lie and say I wasn’t hungry(I thought they’d tell my parents, and really didn’t want to disappoint them) I still lie to this day about my eating habits.  Once high school started, I had quit gymnastics as a whole and studio 
dance.  I got onto the high school dance team and started competing with them.  I’m still not eating lunch and occasionally skipping supper.  My friends make fun of the fact that I have a lunchbox with nothing in it.  Sometimes they jokingly bring up that I had an eating disorder, I don’t hold any of this against them, because, after all, I lie to them and say it’s because of my “weird eating schedule”.  

But now I’m a sophomore in high school, I’m mostly relying on caffeine to get me through the day and maybe intake 100-250 calories
 a day.  I know I sound stupid not knowing that what I’m doing is super dangerous.  But I just kind of realized that this is an issue and maybe I need to sort it out?

Edit:  I have now been seeing a therapist for a few months, she has been helping me work through my problems.  I have not been diagnosed yet, but my therapist has brought up certain eating disorders she thinks I may have.  She is most certain I have Anorexia athletica, which is when one obsesses over losing the calories they have just eaten.  I’m just glad that I’ve gotten help for it, even though it was a little tough telling my parents what was happening, but I’m glad I did.

&amp;#x200B;

so i'm an 18 year old, 154cm female and in Oct 2018, i was 75kg and i decided to do something about it. i decided to to start eating 700kcal everyday to lose weight. my goal  was 55kg and it was working. it was fine because i wasn't starving and i never truly denied myself food. if i was feeling really hungry, i would eat something. i weighed myself everyday and recorded it. i started purging at the beginning of Dec 2018 but i would only purge when i eat something super unhealthy like chicken and chips. everything was fine. i would only purge maybe once every 1 or 2 months.  it hit March, i was 60kg and i hit a plateau where i fluctuated between 60-61kg for a month. i was so angry at my body for doing this when i was so close to my goal. i didn't eat more than 300kcal for about 5 days, my body finally responded and i started losing weight. after that plateau, my purging got more frequent so i would throw up normal 300-500kcal meals. but still, it wasn't that bad, it was only once a week or so. i started purging at school, restaurant toilets, practically anywhere that had a toilet. i never thought i had a problem though. i just thought of it as damage control. 

i reached my 55kg goal in May 2019 and i stopped counting calories and weighing myself everyday but i wasn't happy with my body at all. i would still purge and it was almost everyday. i would have about 250kcal at school (2 energy drinks &amp; crisps), have dinner and then throw up dinner. i would still snack after, i just couldn't hack full meals, i'm not sure why. but i had a fundamental rule that i would never throw up breakfast. i have no idea where that rule came from but i stuck to it religiously so my body had some sustenance. i got down to about 51kg and the summer holidays came about. i still had breakfast and snacks everyday and i would still throw up but not as frequently and definitely not everyday. i still disliked my body but i didn't think about it that much. 

school started again in Sep 2019 and maybe a week into school i decided to stop eating crisps at lunch as i started to dislike my body more and it was on my mind more often. so i was back to having two energy drinks at school everyday - one for breakfast &amp; one for lunch. everything and i mean everything i ate other than those came back up. i wouldn't keep anything down. i still had my breakfast rule so to get around that, i stopped eating breakfast on weekends. i cut my lunch energy drink out and soon i cut my breakfast one too. i got down to 48kg at the end of September and hit another plateau so i ate 700kcal for 2 days to boost my metabolism and gained 0.4kg. i cried so much and decided that i would simply not eat above 250kcal and whatever did would come right back up. i got out of my plateau on the 8th Oct.

today is the 19th Oct 2019 and i weighed in at 44.1kg. i'm 18, 154cm and my BMI is 18.6. i hate my body more than anything. all i see is fat, fat and more fat. i'm terrified of food and i'm terrified of gaining weight. i average 150kcal everyday. i wake up thinking about food &amp; weight and i fall asleep thinking about food &amp; weight. i'm constantly hungry and i watch food shows religiously to curb my hunger. my throat aches and my hand is bruised from purging 2/3 times a day. i'm always cold, i'm always dizzy, i have no energy and my body aches. i'm in my last year of school and instead of focusing on my studies, i'm focused on calories. i'm so tired of my life revolving around food and i hurt from forcing myself to throw up a 46kcal biscuit. deep down, rationally, i know i can't gain 3kg from eating cereal or a sandwich or a cookie but i'm still so terrified. my parents &amp; friends are getting worried so i hide more &amp; more. i wear gloves to cover my purging scars and i isolate myself in my room to avoid food. as soon as i wake up, i've planned what i'm eating for that day. i weigh myself 4/5 times a day and i freak out if the scale goes up by 0.1kg at any time during the day. i'm so fixated on bodies and whenever i see someone slimmer than me, i feel so disgusted at myself. i've tried to eat normally and keep food down but i can't even keep lettuce down. i feel so uncomfortable whenever there's anything in my stomach. i'm starting to fear drinking because my body might hold onto the water and cause me to gain weight. i don't know how to get out of this. i don't want to eat or gain weight but i'm so tired of feeling this way. i know i'm not obese but that's what i see whenever i look at my body.

so i guess the question is, am i developing an eating disorder and if so, which one? i'd also like to clarify that i don't binge at all. any answers would be much appreciated. thank you.",-0.4172346104895886,eating_disorders
djz57u,1571460543,"Hi,

I recently learned that I have to take a leave of absence from work and enter full day treatment for anorexia and restrictive eating. I’ve tried Googling what to expect, but there aren’t a ton of results. If anyone else has gone through full day treatment, it’d be super helpful.

1. Are you forced to eat the full meals provided? And, if you don’t, what happens?
2. How do they measure progress? If you continue to lose weight, but are starting to feel better mentally, is that considered progress?
3. Is it depressing or encouraging being around so many other people with the same issues?
4. How did you explain the time away from work or school to those around you who didn’t know about your disorder?
5. Any advice?",0.021845647108525,eating_disorders

Me and food are just weird. I just want things to be safe. I'm aware most food available to me is perfectly safe and I'm in no way concerned of being harmed by food myself it's just. I need things to be safe and I don't know why but being vegan has helped a lot. That being said vegan recreations of nonvegan food does not help. When I try vegan groups they like social eating. It's not scary for them like when somebody offers them a rice crispy treat they can just deal. They can say no thank you in a way that doesn't make the other person feel bad. Where I start freaking out and get upset and give them an angry no! It's a social issue for them and sure it's nice to feel like I'm doing good things, it's not about that and if you want me to encourage people to be vegan based on my own experience it's just going to be me losing it.

djhvvr,1571370638,"Hey guys, 

so I've had a restrictive eating disorder and I'm currently recovering from it. My weight is healthy. I'm finally eating enough calories to gain weight at a slow pace or at least not lose any, even though I still have many ""sick"" thought patters (e.g. if I'm not working out for several days, I'll start restricting myself because I'll get fat,etc.) 

Anyways, I've been feeling a lot better ever since I started eating better, however, I feel like ever since I've had my eating disorder, I've become a lot more serious and disinterested in social interactions. 

I used to be a ""silly"" person who enjoyed interacting with others and do stupid stuff, but now, I feel like everything I do must bring me forward some way or another and when  I go out with friends, it feels like a chore - I feel like I'm wasting my time. I went from like a laid-back, social person to someone who's uptight, introverted with no emotions.

The only things that bring me joy at the moment are lifting weights, doing BJJ, getting good grades, my family and eating. I really don't care about my friends or pretty much anything else at the moment. I didn't use to be like that.

dj7zx4,1571326201,"This happened several years ago, when I was 15 and recovering for the first time. I was in an outpatient program where a therapist would visit me at home every Monday. She asked me to write down everything I ate, for every meal of the day, every week, and then we would go through it together. 

I wasn’t on any meal plan, and I had to figure out by myself what to eat. Now, one of my safe foods during my early recovery was yoghurt. It was a part of almost every meal, sometimes with oatmeal, fruit, next to a sandwich, etc. This was also during my extreme hunger period, so I would eat fairly big amounts of food. 

When going through my food diary, she pointed out that I was “eating too much” and that “yoghurt has a lot of sugar in it and that’s not healthy”. Now, I see how that’s something you would point out to someone who doesn’t have problems with food. But it devastated me, hearing I was eating too much. 

The result was me only eating two plain slices of bread for each meal the following week, which she then obviously pointed out as too little. The whole thing was just incredibly confusing and frustrating. 

Then, the last home visit, she wanted to weigh me. And she wanted me to see the number. As it was my highest weight yet, I freaked out and cried uncontrollably. I still don’t understand while she would weigh me and let me know the number, and how that would help me in any way. 

It’s been 6 years, and it still sticks with me.

My mother and I went to dinner before my ballet class. It was a diner populated heavily by the elderly and famous for having the best pie. I can’t remember what I ate previously that day but I remember ordering some type of club sandwich because all of the salads looked horribly unappetizing and cheap. Obviously it shouldn’t matter anyways. It came with a small french onion soup. I ate a lot of bread and crackers that were complementary, devoured my soup, but could only peck at my full plate when it arrived. I could feel my stomach stretch against my dance leotard and shorts. My body felt bloated and horrible and I wanted the food to be gone and at the same time let loose and eat as much as I possibly could as I was at a restaurant, something that happens not too often because of how poor I am. I opened up to my mom about how I’ve been struggling lately with my eating. I want to restrict so bad. I am, but not as much as I would like and still maintain my binging habits. I don’t like talking to my mother about these things, for a multitude of reasons as you might find out one way or another, but I was in such a needy position I needed to tell someone how I was doing, hoping to be met with comments saying that they have noticed and are worried because I am losing weight (I didn’t get any).

There is no point in telling about our brief and lowly conversation so I am just going to jump to the bit when we are in the car, on our way to drop me off. My mom brings back up hospitalization and I say that I don’t want to go back. I’ve been on three separate occasions in the past 8 months all for depression, anxiety, and then ED. I get upset because I feel like whenever I struggle my family just wants to throw me back in.

I chew on a tooth pick from the restaurant and, after some silence, say “I’m not going back. I don’t even look sick.”

With my last words my face contorted into a horrible figure and I started to sob like a child, the tooth pick hanging limply in my mouth. My mom parks in the usual spot and listens to me scream and sob for a good 10 minutes straight, without any words. I tell her that I feel horrible. I’m not anorexic. That is my main fixation. I remember screaming and crying at the ED program that “I get an eating disorder and I can’t even lose the weight. I get the one that makes me ugly. I wish that if this was gonna happen then I at least got the one that would make me beautiful. I couldn’t even do that right. I couldn’t even lose the weight.”

I restrict and binge and eat normally and cycle through it constantly, tearing myself apart from the second I wake up to the very last moments before I go to sleep.

My mother tries to get me to go to dance and tells me that it will make me feel better but I won’t stop screaming and shaking and crying. I can’t remember how long its been but my mom gets me out of the car and I can’t even walk. My legs hurt and tingle and my mom has to hold me up and escort me down the city to the building. But the closer we get the more my legs and ankles hurt and when we are just outside the door I start crying again. I can’t think about looking in the mirror at myself with all those other girls that are skinnier than me. I can’t stand the thought of acting like nothing happened when I feel so horrible and sad. My knees buckled and I almost fall to the ground screaming but because my mom already holds me by my shoulders because I could not walk on my own, she pulls me up before I hit the ground and tells me that I’m not going to ballet today.",-0.4244351372016831,eating_disorders

I'm not significantly underweight... I'm too fat to be underweight... And the weird twisted thing is obviously I didn't like to hear that but a small part of me was happy about that and I don't think I have a problem.

However they then told me that my height to weight was 77.31 and that I couldn't go to school until it gets to 80 bc they're worried about the strain it might have on my heart.

It’s been 7 months now and we are doing great with money and live in a wonderful apartment but the both of us are clinging on to old habits.

We only eat once a day, and if we try to eat more we can’t and feel sick. We feel hungry all day but have no desire or motivation to eat. 

My boyfriend works late hours so what we’ll do is wait till he gets home which is around 5pm and that will be our first meal of the day, we used to at least order huge meals so we could take in our days worth of food in one sitting but recently We can’t even finish our one meal. I don’t think either of us have finished a dinner in at least a month now. 

Last week my friend brought up that she was concerned for our well being and that we looked skinny and that we are basically starving ourselves.we never really even thought about us having an issue and I still don’t think we have an eating disorder but I’d like to hear peoples opinion.

So basically, we aren’t eating until late hours of the day/night and when we are eating we are either shoving it down our throats or picking at it.

learning how to teach your mother (47F) how not to trigger you, (even though she had an eating disorder most of her life but is very HAPPILY MOVED ON AND RECOVERED), is the hardest most emotionally draining thing in my life right now. we are extremely close, and she’s there for me through anything. i mostly hide the severity of it because i don’t want to hear it from her, or hurt/worry her. but she knows about my disorder and today i had a bad day. so i call my mom. i have this long ass conversation about how i don’t like when she says “if you don’t eat i’ll order you delivery right now” or “have you eaten today?” “will you go eat?” “you need to eat something” “you’d feel better if you would eat” etc

like i get she’s my mom and she cares. i get that, she’s not doing anything wrong, but fuck dude. when she compliments my appearance and i just flatly say “okay mom” and she says “oh come ON, you KNOW you’re GORGEOUS” and i have to say, “actually no mom, i don’t. and i don’t want to think/hear about my appearance. i think about it enough.” and she says she understands. she gets it.  she’s going to work on it. i have to stay open with her, she says. i think the call ends on a decent note. 

shortly after on Facebook, she reposts something that says, word for word, “Diet Tip: if you think you’re hungry. you might just be thirsty. Have a bottle of wine first, and see how you feel.”

again, it’s not my mother fault. but this shit makes me want to jump off a fucking cliff. like i feel so misunderstood, it’s insane. how could the person i am the closest to in this world, not see me clear enough? where does that leave me?? what is my future going to be like?

i’m going to a (new) therapist in the morning tomorrow. 
i hope he makes me feel better.

— friends, there’s a very, very high chance that i’m going to have to go inpatient soon for my eating disorder. just in the worst headspace i’ve ever been, and it’s consumed me. i just want to know that i’m not a lost fucking cause, even if i’m not ready to enter full recovery right now. 
i just want to feel better.

dcvgtp,1570129581,"Hi! First time poster on this sub, just found it and want some advice on two things. This is a long one since I have to explain my situation, TLDR in the end summarising the main question.

So I had a bad depression episode for a bit over a year. I've been getting better and have been off meds for about 6 months (with doctors""permission"" since the period after my last symptoms was long enough). 

One of the worst ways my depression affected me was that I couldn't eat. It wasn't a weight thing at all. I just got sick from the tought of food and everything tasted like shit. I tried to eat anything even chocolate but it all just tasted like ash in my mouth. 

So my first question is, was this even an eating disorder? I hope this isn't the wrong place for this discussion. Sorry of it is.

Okay, going on. During the year that I was sick, I lost almost 15kg. I was already fit before but lost soooo much muscle and fat during my illness. I was constantly tired and cold and miserable since the lack of fuel in my body made me dizzy. I also had a love-hate relationship with my body and how it looked.

I've now gained weight since getting better, around 10kg, mostly fat since I haven't had the time to get my muscle mass back. I love the way I'm looking now and just want to get more fit and gain some buff arms :D. 

I'm 164cm and weigh 61kg, my fat % is around 25. That's perfect for me. I just want maybe 2-5kg more in muscle.

But still. Having been so skinny before and now some of the clothes I bought then don't fit me... I feel insecure about my weight gain. And the worst part is, I don't know how to tell people about this. I have a pretty new relationship (7 months) and I've told about my depression, but haven't gotten into the details too much.  Especially this whole ED part of it is a very touchy subject for me. 

Now during our relationship I've gained around 6kg of the whole weight. He has noticed it. He makes small comments meaning well. Examples: 'we should eat a bit healthier' or 'would you like to start swimming at the pool house now that you can't at the beach anymore?' (I love swimming and I'm guessing this is more a suggestion for me to continue my favorite hobby during the winter too). 

Question 2: he has obviously noticed my weight gain and I don't know how to tell him that it's a good thing and that I wasn't happy with how I looked when we met and am happier now.. I'm scared that he isn't attracted to the curvier me and wants the skinny me back.

TLDR: I was too skinny before I met my bf and have gained weight. I don't know how to tell him about this being a good and healthy thing for me since I'm very ashamed of my illness.

Do I have an eating disorder? I don’t think I do, but then I do think I do. I could be looking for attention. Right? I don’t know. I don’t want to self-diagnose because I haven’t seen a doctor or whatever. But about 2 months ago I found out I weighed about 180 pounds. Sure I’m used to being the short and chubby kid everywhere I went but actually knowing how much I weighed hit different. I started eating less which most people thought was normal so I went with it. But I started thinking about how much weight I could lose if I didn’t eat at all so I tried that but didn’t even last the day 😅. So I started purging right after eating. Hunger started feeling like my new normal. When I weighed myself last weekend I weighed 170. I’ve tried actually eating without even thinking about purging but I can’t, I can’t keep my food down anymore. I can’t eat as much as I used to be able to, which could be a good thing because I used to eat A LOT. Like whole pizzas by myself. But now I can barely eat 2 slices without wanting to puke. At least my jawline is visible though😂I don’t want to tell any of my friends because, well, this doesn’t seem normal for guys? Two hours ago I ate a sandwich and basically forced myself to stay in my room. I just tried purging it and it was already digested I guess? I tell myself it’s fine but it feels like there’s someone making fun of me. Calling me a bunch of names and judging me. But no one really is right? The logical part of me is telling myself that everything is fine and I just need to eat more healthy things and lose the weight in a healthy way. But I can’t eat. Well I can technically. But I know I’ll end up purging so I don’t want to because it’ll be a waste of food. “There are starving children in Africa” I tell myself that when I eat but I still purge.

I didn’t have anyone to take me two states away to see her because they’re all busy with their adult lives. which I understand obviously. Am I ranting? But the point is I had stopped eating for a few days. I had bottled up everything for a while and when I did ask a teacher for help they just had me sent home for the day. I started having nightmares, my grades dropped, since it was a new school I had no friends, and I never got to say bye to my grandma. I started cutting. When my mom found out she just told me to stop. She told me that “everyone feels sad” I felt bad for everything.  I didn’t stop cutting. But I did start purging. Okay I’m ranting.

Lately, I have been very stressed out with school, work, and my friends' drama. Unlike most people who stress-eat, I find it extremely hard to eat anything if I am stressed.

dby83g,1569957362,"TL;DR my mom, god love her, is making me worse, too fat, wanna die, can't stop my problems and idk what to do.(crap description but ok)

I am 26(f) btw, just to preface, and we supoort eachother financially so I cant leave even if i wanted to.

This is a mix of (potential ED?) and other things but I just can't handle this anymore.

My mother, is a fantastic mother, but I am morbidly obese (300+ lbs, been 200+ since high school) and she doesn't know how to cook for 2 people. Only a full family. Ever since my dad died she has only had myself and her. She has a PLETHORA of health issues and barely eats anything. I can cook, but don't often as it makes me feel gross or I end up making dinner for us, and she doesn't eat. (Or i cook like her and make enough for a family of 3 or 4)

I have an issue(s) of eating nothing until I feel like passing out, bored eating, stress eating, binge eating, depressed/emotional eating, purging after eating, all of the eating issues. I used to and sometimes still do, view food as a reward when I do certain things. Other times I use food as what it is, just to keep me from passing out and staying somewhat alive. Other times I just want to puke thinking about food.

99% of the time, nothing sounds good food wise and I feel sick thinking about eating. When I can eat, often times its unhealthy because of my stomach issues and eating healthy makes my stomach/bowel issues flare up. 

Anyway, this brings me to the issue my mom and I have. Example, tonight..she made fried chicken, homemade mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The chicken pieces are HUGE(breasts) and i grabbed one, a bunch of sprouts and a fair amount of potatoes. I ate very little chicken , all of my potatoes and sprouts and shes giving me hell for not eating all of my food. Bare in minde these split chicken breasts are THE SIZE OF MY HEAD AT LEAST. I felt sick and full right when I started eating and about to vomit like 5 min before i stopped.

I told her, i need to stop eating when im full and she interrupted me mid sentence saying ""i know what youre about to say, you always say it"" and im upset and feel like i want to throw up everything and hurt myself (selfharm via the standard method y'all may be familiar with)

I straight up told her earlier, my health issues, mostly my weight, are stressing me out. I have an EMG on the 15th and i already know what they're gonna say. She says if it ends up involving surgery they wont operate cause im too fat. I cant lose weight. Ive tried. Every fucking way i can think of and it always comes back and then some. Also, you cant exercise like you want to when youre in too much pain to even walk.

I told her i legitimately will just kill myself if this continues because I cant handle it anymore. She tells me to shut the fuck up and i retort with she doesnt understand. She says she does she used to be 230lbs. Im like WHOOP DEE FUCKING DOO! IM OVER 300LBS AND 5FT 4.5IN IM GONNA DIE! Add that plus mental illness being untreated because i cant find something affordable and I have a full time job, no you DONT fucking understand and you're making it SO MUCH WORSE.


Anyway, thats a long winded summary of whats happening and rn i just wanna throw up. Im so sick to my stomach.

This whole issue makes me very unsure. I have had an eating disorder before but exercise addiction wasn’t part of it. I don’t exercise to alter my body image or burn calories. It’s always to get better and build skills.

daozqk,1569721521,"First things first, I've always been skinny; as far as I'm aware, I have had an 'underweight' BMI my whole life. But over the past two years I've been dealing with depression which has caused further decline in my appetite. I don't think my meds are to blame here since I've tried several ones and didn't notice a difference between them.

Anyway, I was using the bathroom at a friend's place when I noticed his scale (I don't own one) and realized I hadn't weighed myself in forever. So I gave it a go... [110 lbs](#s) flat, at 5'11"" (21 years old). This seemed awfully low since I don't remember ever weighing less than [120-125 lbs](#s). When I got home I was a bit concerned so I looked up a BMI converter to be met with a 15.3, which put me at 'severely underweight'. I was kind of shocked, to be honest.

This happened two days ago and I've thought about it, as well as doing a bit of reading. It seems to be universally accepted that a BMI this low isn't a good thing. I definitely agree, but I don't really know how to proceed from here. I know I need to put on weight but I don't know how urgent it is and how I should go about it.

The only things I could link back to my weight is feeling queasy/nauseous somewhat frequently. Otherwise I feel relatively normal. (Well, as 'normal' as you can feel when you're depressed). Should I just try forcing myself to eat more frequently and see if that works or is this an immediate ""holy shit go, to the doctor"" sort of thing?

d7kap5,1569118148,"Hey,

I just wanted to share my experience. Maybe it will help someone.. idk.

First I would like to say that I haven't shared this with ANYONE. Its been a secret for a very long time.

I always ate whatever I wanted. As a kid you don't have to worry about calories, your inner thigh fat, or how people look at your body in general. I was so  care free. My strained relationship with food began when I entered Pre-k. I got picky and didn't want to eat things I thought would ""make me fat"". I developed a very irrational fear of gaining weight which made me depressed. The first time anyone ever called me fat was in 2nd grade. I remember exactly how it happened . We were in reading circle, and my friend at the time was sitting next to me. I remember he stared at me and then, at my stomach. He poked it and said ""why are you fat"". the sudden rush of emotions I had never felt before filled me. Anger, guilt, sadness. I remember wanting to cry but I just couldn't. This was all just the beginning.

Middle school came around and I noticed I didn't look like other girls. The preppy, popular girls in my grade had skinny thighs and small waists . I looked down at my own thighs and saw the difference. (my thighs were very muscular) I became obsessed over thigh gaps. 

I started restricting freshman year. I also went through a binge phase as well but not as heavy. I remember going to get my physical, my doctor came in and looked at me with a scared look. I had lost 11 lbs in only one month. I pretended to be confused but internally I was so happy.  

Sophomore year is when I started purging. I don't remember much from it. all I remember was being so sad, so sick, and in need of medical help. nothing was ever the same. 

My main source of ""thinspo"" was Brandy Melville. They made skinny look beautiful. they made skinny look healthy. they made skinny look perfect. I was instantly obsessed.

Now I realize how extremely toxic it is for young girls to see stuff like that in the media. It screwed with my head and made me believe I was doing something healthy when I would starve myself for days. It made me believe that I was going to die alone and ugly if I didn't start to lose weight. It broke relationships, friendships, and most importantly it broke me.

You are beautiful, you are loved, you are perfect in your own way. Don't ever let anyone tell you anything else.",-0.4152785498399754,eating_disorders
d7f2t9,1569094374,"I really want to get better and I just wondered if anyone has any tips or anything or ways to distract yourself.

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

My bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. Last Thursday I finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad and yesterday I broke down and asked for help and he explained it to my mum...

I dont know if he has an eating disorder, but he's always talking about ""gains"" and how he needs to lose more weight to get more defined.

Eating takes time and energy and everything sounds revolting. If I am to eat, I only want to eat *this* thing or nothing at all. My recent food has been pickles. Everything that isn't pickles makes me want to throw up or starve. I recently read up on ARFID and I want to say it matches that, but I'm scared to give it a name.

d1yxnb,1568071074,"It's sad when your mom always talks about your weight and how you eat. When I'm restricting she always tells me I have a cute little body. If I were to get any thinner she would start to call me too thin and would try to force me to eat. If I were to get a pound larger she would talk about how big my thighs are. Any time she hears me coughing in the bathroom she assumes that I'm purging when most of the time I'm sick and I'm just coughing. 

She always talks about how far she is and how jealous she is of my body. I've told her to stop multiple times bc it triggers me. She tells me she doesn't give a fuck. It's like she wants me not to get help. She always pulls me out of therapy. It's always a problem with her.

d12862,1567893095,"Last year I was a junior in college and really struggled with my weight, and constantly feeling anxious about eating more than 800-900 calories a day. I lost around 25 pounds in this time, and would sometimes stand in the kitchen and do jumping jacks or sit ups to burn off extra calories or before I let myself eat. I felt really out of control. I had a therapist at the time for other unrelated  things I had been dealing with, and we came up with a plan and talked a lot about it. I got back to eating pretty normally, though i did still skip meals here and there in order to cut calories. It took me a long time to stop worrying about or counting my calories. 
I gained most of the weight back and wasn’t happy, but felt that it wasn’t as big of a deal as I felt it was before.

Well—school just started again, and I am really right back at counting my calories, and restricting, and feeling uncomfortable if I’m not hungry. I am terrified of what I’m doing to my body, but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I want to be skinny.

I don’t know what to do, because my therapist does not specialize in eating disorders, and I don’t know how to find someone that does without my parents finding out. 

Also—I feel really guilty because sometimes this almost feels like a choice. I knew if I let myself start restricting again I would become obsessed with it, but I almost wanted that to happen.

I'm short so I've always been healthy and even now my weight is considered healthy for my height but I'm scared of it. I'm scared to see the higher number on the scale, it's only 4 or 5 lbs more but I hate it. I hate seeing it yet I just can't stop thinking about it. I can't help but weigh myself just to see and when it goes UP I get so upset. And this is terrifying. I don't want to be in a dangerous situation.

It’s weird, but I don’t feel like I deserve to eat. Food makes me happy, and I know I don’t deserve to be happy. I’m too much of a coward to kill myself, so I’ve just been hurting myself in other ways. I don’t really eat until the afternoon, where I’ll binge eat until it hurts to move. Starving myself (I pretend I’m fasting) isn’t that hard because I don’t mind the pain. I feel ashamed when eating in front of others, so I only feel comfortable eating at home.

My parents are overprotective, so I have to lie to them often. They found out a while ago I’ve been skipping lunch and breakfast, and ask me everyday about what I’ve eaten. My mother is worried that I might have an eating disorder, so I have to eat when she asks me to. 

Usually I only eat dinner because my parents want me to. That’s where the binging begins. I eat a large amount of food and get this.. happiness? It feels good and I hate it because I can’t stop eating. Food tastes good, food makes me happy, but I don’t deserve to feel happy. After eating, I feel guilty and want to throw up.

cz2a5x,1567501260," My best friend/roommate is in recovery, and because I'm a writer, she's encouraged me to write a fiction piece approaching eating disorder narratives differently. (She and I have talked a lot about how most available fiction narratives contribute to stigma or reinforce myths). She's worked with me a lot on this, but I still have some perfunctory questions I need to clarify that I can't easily find answers to online. While I know a lot from her of what it feels like to be in treatment and what sorts of things happen, I want to thoroughly understand logistics. Right now, she spends so much time in treatment I don't want to waste her limited leisure time taking notes on the minutiae of treatment -- that time is better spent watching Doctor Who together or talking about which sort of moth we would each be if we were both moths.

This is a fiction piece, and not intended to be educational or didactic. But fiction explores ideas, allows people to empathize with experiences they have never had, or identify with characters whose experiences they do relate to. My goal is to write something that 1) helps people who don't have EDs understand what treatment and recovery is actually like, 2) makes people who've experienced it think, ""That's so accurate! Exactly!"" It would be impossible to tell a good, interesting, well-written story if I wasn't achieving the above.

I know that this might be triggering or just exhausting for some people, so people absolutely have the right to not answer. But if anyone is interested in demystifying and generous enough to share, I would be so, so appreciative!!! I'm definitely sourcing my research from a lot of different places, but I think it would be a huge mistake not to ask a variety of people who can speak anonymously online.

Here are some things I want to make sure I get right:

**What staff members are there in Residential? What are their duties? How often are they each around/how often do clients interact with them?**  
I've visited my friend and gotten to know staff during groups, and of course I know a lot from what she tells me, but I still want to make sure I thoroughly know what the treatment team looks like. Online websites usually only list people like the therapists, if anyone at all, but I know there's a much broader treatment team and I want to make sure I have a handle on what they do and their interactions with clients.

**What does a ""typical"" Residential schedule look like? (Daily, weekly, monthly?)**  
I know this can vary wildly from treatment center to treatment center, but there do seem to be some consistencies (groups, one-on-one therapy, outings, medical stuff, etc).

**How is conversation at meals/snacks conducted? What are some examples of conversations?**  
I know the typical table rules, and I know that -- at least at dinners -- there are sometimes games (we play a kind of 20 Questions my friend learned at treatment at home), or a question people take turns answering (my friend famously proposes obscure ones that go over really well -- like ""what kind of fabric would you be?""). Is this just at dinner, or at all meal/snack times? What are some examples you've seen or heard of?

**Medical stuff -- totally understand if people feel uncomfortable with this one.**  
I don't actually have any questions about weighing, but definitely feel free to offer in case I'm missing things. But I know you have to get labs done before going to treatment, and then they continue to happen while in treatment. Who conducts these labs? Is it the same person or different nurses/specialists? Are they these providers there all the time or is there a dedicated medical day? What sorts of tests are conducted (I think vitamin/mineral blood tests, general urine tox tests, heart rate, etc). I know what all this looks like in a hospital environment, but what about residential? Is it onsite or offsite?

**Insurance -- the most frustrating.**  
Who's in charge of all the insurance/billing/blahblahblah? Do they do double duty in other roles, or are there dedicated administrators for that? How often do clients interact with them?

**If you got this far even just reading, thank you!**  
I genuinely have so much respect and admiration for people battling EDs. For general health stuff, we think of ""recovery"" as ""taking it easy"" -- but with EDs, it's *going to battle*. Recovery is courageous.

If I were a moth, I would be a peppered moth.

My last attempt before I got hospitalized was an OD. I was anemic back then and I was taking ferrous sulfate.  I took around 50 pills that day and woke up in the hospital. My doctor told me that because of my condition (anorexia), my body had very little to no nutrients. I had to stay in the hospital for like..a month and I was forced to eat, so theres that. After that, my doctor had each of my pills regulated and i had to take them while and adult was watching me.

My goal was never  to become stick thin i just wanted to maintain my weight loss i was miserable when I was overweight 

I deal with depression and anxiety and I tend to go through periods where I deal with low moods, withdrawal  from life in general I tend to stay in my room all day.

I first did this in January lost a lot of weight but I developed IBS as a result of this and it’s hindered my life ever since, I would purge more frequently as I was scared to keep certain foods in my stomach.

I decided I would stop purging in may 2019 I knew I had a problem, I stopped purging for 3 weeks and when I checked my scale I had gained 15 pounds. I went into panic mode I felt betrayed by my body, I intended to get better but felt crushed that within such a short space I had gained so much weight.

I was able to maintain roughly the same weight for years through this exhausting cycle, but as of recently it's been a steady restriction and this Summer alone I've lost almost 40lbs. I'm at the lowest weight I've ever been in my life and I've never felt worse. I look in the mirror and all I see is the all the weight I still need to lose. I've completely fooled everyone into thinking that I'm losing it all with a healthy diet and with my gym membership, but it's all bullshit. No one would probably believe the truth anyway which is one of the reasons i don't seek help.

 The only time I ever time told anyone that there was something wrong with me was 2 years ago; I broke down in front of my now ex and confessed to him crying one night that I thought I was suffering from an ed. In that moment for the first time I truly  wanted help for my personal struggle and thought I'd be met with his sympathy and ears so I could finally confess to him the habits and rituals that consume me and have been for years and he could push me to seek help. He laughed like it was a joke because at the time I was overweight and going through extreme bingeing cycles in secret. I felt so completely embarrassed and still do looking back at it. He changed the subject and told me instead what he thought was wrong with me. That relationship is over now and I try not to think of him and the other problems he caused me, but I have never tried again to seek help. These past couple months have been so rough I had to go part time at work to try and cope with my issues, including of course my lovely eating problems. I just got home from work not too long ago and binged for the first time in a while. I feel so awful. I tried to throw up, but I never have been able to purge so I'm currently just trying to distract myself with youtube videos and other stuff just to ignore how bad i feel about what I just did. I hate this feeling. I hate bingeing. I hate restricting. I hate being consumed by my weight 24/7. But now feel like I'm in too deep. I wish I could be normal.

ct8nlo,1566345761,"So my whole life, my eating habits have been weird af. I eat super slow for some reason (around 35 to 60 minutes for a well-balanced, healthy meal that has fruits, vegetables, and milk at least). Now this may not sound too bad, but when you’ve been like this since you were born and school typically allows for 30 minute lunches, this becomes kinda severe. Not to mention how barely anyone can wait for you. In addition, I’m a really picky eater and have a below average appetite I believe. 

So what has this lead to? Well, I’m in undergrad and I’m pretty short for a male my age. Additionally, I get sick easily, such as the common cold and digestive issues (although those can be explained by other causes perhaps). To top this off, my family always gets on my ass for this; a lot of the times when I eat with my family, they’re always telling me to hurry up and telling me the consequences of eating so damn slow (e.g. less time to study). I understand why my family acts this way; I agree with them but the problem is no matter how hard I try, there’s no way I can eat quicker than like 35 minutes for a well-balanced, healthy meal. Sadly, my family thinks I can improve and be like most ppl but I honestly don’t think I can unless I specifically change my behavior somehow (other than trying to eat faster, I choose foods that I find tastier so I naturally eat them faster). I’m kinda screwed if I can’t find a solution for this since I’m sure the professional world doesn’t always allocate around 45 minutes to simply finish a meal (this doesn’t include cooking or cleaning up). 

I think I might have over sensitive taste buds as I can eat certain foods like eggs quickly but most of those foods are unhealthy and there’s honestly not too many foods I like. I also noticed I have an enhanced gag reflex, like when I have a certain food on my tongue for too long, I want to vomit. I suspect the length of my eating is just due to the fact I’m a slow person in general, but I’m not sure about that. I’m pretty sick and tired of this.

Could a service dog be a better choice because it can calm me down in restaurants, and other public places (where an ESD cannot. They only can at home and are only there for comfort. They have no training). Since they have to do a specific task, pressure therapy to calm anxiety would be one of those tasks, and keeping people away from me when needed (creating a barrier).

Eating at least one meal a day, no purging, little snacks here and there. She's considered overweight now that she has gained all of weight back but was considered healthy when she was constantly purging and engaging in her other anorexic habits. However, she was anemic, she would pass out going down the stairs or in the shower and nowhere near healthy. The past couple of days, I have noticed her joining ProAna accounts and posting on them. She also talked about calculating how many calories she can eat per day to loose weight by a certain period of time, which was around 100-200 calories. She's even gone as far as texting some of her old coaches and asking for meanspo in her image. I had a discussion with her about it and she said that she feels better and less crazy when she talks to people in ProAna accounts. That, it boosts her because she hears what she feels about herself aloud. She brought up how hard it is for her to keep food down because it hurts so much, and her frustrations to gaining so much weight back. She said that she loved the feeling of being empty. I am simply looking for something I could do for her to help her. Perhaps make her her favorite foods. I've read that some people use degrading during sex to help with wanting meanspo. I am just worried with her, interacting with people like that who think that weight-shaming is okay to endorse weight-loss, that it will become more than just the comfort of hearing what she feels. I'm worried that it will turn into, they're right, they're so very right and listen to them and then we're back to where we started. I would appreciate any tips, or thoughts, things I should know, just anything really. Perhaps make her her favorite meals when she gets home from work, or take her to our favorite walking spot. Maybe help her graph things out. I'm just not really sure what to do in general. Anything that people with an ED think that people that date them should know or would have been really helpful to them while in a relationship. Thank you. ",-0.0446625783232306,edsupport

Only problem that I still have is body image, but that is getting better.
Well, during the summer I gained a bit of weight. Maybe a kilo or two. Not a big deal, just a bit of belly. I stopped overexercising, but am generally an active person. I am always going somewhere, take slow walks, do yoga and cycle. For the last month I've been lazing out before going to uni.


Just before travelling to uni, I broke my ankle. I can't move for a week at all and next Thu i am getting a cast which I need to have for 3 weeks.
Now that I am sitting or laying down the whole day, I feel like I've gained even more weight. 
I can see that my belly is bigger, i have rolls and my face is all puffy and i feel like a have a bit of double chin.



Has anyone had similar experience???
Did my body just swell up a little bit? Possibly because of a shock of breaking my ankle and sitting around? (I really can't sit around all day, it's weird for me) Or is it in my head? Because when I gained the weight I kind of had the security of knowing I will lose it when I start uni and start going places more, working etc.?

70mhm3,1505639018,"Hey! I want your input and thoughts!

&amp;nbsp;

I’m writing a screenplay (20-30 min in length, fiction). As an ex-EDNOS sufferer, I want to portray an eating disorder in a subjective way. It's about a girl turning 19, who has tried cancelling her birthday since she is trying to starve herself, but her best friend is plotting a surprise party. We are going to view the world through her eyes, her illness.

&amp;nbsp;

But here's the thing: Even though I’m choosing a horror movie style (because that was how I experienced my disorder), I don’t want to trigger people who have suffered, or ""inspire"" people who can come to be suffering. I want to keep triggers DOWN. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to focus on the lies and the social aspect of keeping an eating disorder up. I will focus on the obsession to remain in control.

&amp;nbsp;

**I have decided that the film will not:** Show numbers (scales, calories). Show the protagonist pulling her body in a mirror. Observe any very skinny body. Show “successful tricks” of how to lose weight. Make the protagonist have a job where she needs to look a certain way (model, actress, dancer).

&amp;nbsp;

**However, I do want to portray:** A binge. Purging. Excruciating hunger feelings. An obsession with food (but really, with control).

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think this can be portrayed without being too triggering? Or should I just accept that this will be a triggering film? Where is your line crossed?

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make this film partly because I think ED-films that ARE out there, aren't very good. They neither help anyone close who wants to understand, nor validates the one who has suffered who wants to be understood.

Participants must be 18 years old and have engaged in binge eating (eating large quantities of food across a confined period, whilst feeling out of control) and/or purging (vomiting, use of laxatives, exercise) in response to eating. 

This is a voluntary and anonymous survey, so there is no forced participation, and you can simply close the website before submission if you no longer wish to continue. Please note that the collected data becomes unidentifiable after submission, thus, we cannot locate individual submissions to remove after this point. 

[Please note that this survey may be distressing for some people]

To access the survey, please follow this link;
http://deakinpsychology.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7V42yePrEg5VfCt

There will be a Plain Language Statement that will give you more information about the study before you begin your survey, otherwise, feel free to ask questions on this post!

Thanks so much for your interest and/or participation!

Have a great day!

One of the key things I've learned is that individuals with anorexia mustn't be painted with the same brush. As a crude example, my wife agrees with most that she doesn't look good at a very low BMI.

She recently started to see a new therapist and made some good progress over ~2 years. Her BMI increased a tad but more progress was made around reducing the time spent doing rituals and doing more ""normal"" things like studying, working, living with me and going on holidays etc. I have no doubt that she got pleasure from these things - although her rituals, physical health and anxieties obviously get in the way.

The therapist moved away and her weight fell again. She admitted herself to a hospital. She had a meeting with her dietician, consultant, nurse and therapist yesterday and I joined via a conference call. Her doctor said something that surprised me and **I want to know what evidence (anecdotal and medical :)) there might be to support or refute what he said**.

**He said that patients with anorexia cannot be happy with a BMI below about 16. They can get some comfort from their anorexia but they can't experience happiness in the conventional sense.**

I immediately challenged this, knowing that my wife does get happiness from working, studying, going on holiday etc. There is a lot of anxiety too - but this seems to contradict what her doctor said.",0.2477886591356603,edsupport

Some thoughts from a guy who struggled with binge eating disorder for 10 years...

I've seen an unfortunate trend on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Instead of taking steps to stop binge eating, people post sad quotes or images of food they're about binge on. **Why!?!**

It's almost like they're trying to get support from people to continue with their destructive habit. And trust me, I know how it feels to experience depression, even despair, because you think you'll be doomed for the rest of your life. 

But instead of keeping yourself in that cycle, **do something to break yourself free!** Stop thinking of yourself as a ""disordered"" person. *Isn't it possible that you're a completely normal person who developed a bad habit by mistake?*

All I'm saying is that you can CHOOSE to change your life. You just have to decide to do it. 

That's all I wanted to say today. **Maybe it's the words that you needed to hear.** For more info and extra help, I have a complete guide on everything I did stop binge eating for good. Check it out here: http://curebingeeating.com/effortless-eating-ebook/",0.225670658279827,edsupport

Spending hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars on supplements?

Struggling with an eating disorder?

Tired of meal prepping?

Frustrated with the same old cycle?

Pissed that you cannot achieve your goals?

Sick of always trying again, and again, and again, and again...
Everything I just described was me.....for years (2011 - 2015). In know the feelings and frustrations. I can empathize with you because I was there for years; thinking that this would never end and I was doomed to live a miserable life. This is NOT true, you can live the life of freedom you envision, yet seems so unrealistic!

I am dedicated to teaching strategies that give YOU this freedom! YOU this freedom! No more fretting about going out because you are afraid of an eating disorder, that food is ""unclean"" or that you will wreck all of your results. No more doing so BS training programs because it is the only way to get fit or be in shape. No more wasting money on supplements that you don't need, are of poor quality, and are a flat out lie.

This is not some get results quick scheme. I am a person just like yourself. What would you do if you could save yourself a couple hundred dollars a month or gain an extra 10 hours a week? Would you go out more with a significant other, learn a new hobby, play with your kids or grandkids. The possibilities are LIMITLESS and I am here to show you how!

“I can’t believe it,” I thought to myself. I had just left a family Christmas party and was not sick from binging nor did I feel the need to punish myself for eating cookies and drinking beer. At that moment, I closed my eyes and smiled realizing the massive journey that began in 2011.

In fall of 2011, as my days of playing high school football began to wind down, I sought to lose weight. I was always fat growing up, but I played offensive line so I accepted it and just lived my life ignoring the teasing. Skipping all the fights and excess details, because my fat kid story is like all the rest.

That didn’t always work, I would find myself in many detentions for fighting with other kids. I was the typical fat kid, I ate everyone’s lunch growing up because…well mom wouldn’t buy that contraband, also known as twinkies. I worked at Dairy Queen in high school too, people talk about the freshman fifteen in college. Well, they should try the DQ 50ish.

However, once football ended the desire to lose weight was much greater as there seemed to be no logical reason to keep it; plus I just started dating this gorgeous girl (way out of my league). So, in the fall of 2011, things began just like everyone else who looks to lose weight. I started to lift weights and do cardio after school. I also began to watch my diet, even a single carrot was an improvement. As the weight loss progressed I became more obsessed with vanity in myself and my physique. The pendulum swing had begun, I went from being a kid who would eat every edible object in a room (including some that weren’t if people were not looking) to someone who you thought was training for the Mr. Olympia.

The transition did not take place overnight, in fact it happened so slowly and gradually that I did not notice the self-centered monster I was creating. As I soaked up information online from bodybuilding sources, I learned about “clean” foods, meal prepping, cardio, and the works. As time progressed, I became more and more focused on my vanity and physique.

I was spending easily in upwards of 40 hours a week, a “full-time” job on my body and it was not because I enjoyed it, it was simply because I wanted abs and the claimed “physique”. I was doing 30 minutes of fasted cardio every day, then I would lift weights 5-6 days a week followed by another 90 minutes of cardio, and lastly my caloric intake was 1800 calories (mind you I am 6’-0”). If you don't believe me watch this or see that.

To make matters worse, when I did sneak a homemade cookie (deemed “unclean” food by the food gods....damn you!), I would just throw my hands in the air like, “Dang it James! You will never have those abs by eating this quote dirty food!” Thus, since mentally I thought I wrecked all past progress, I would proceed to consume all the cookies, a box of sugar cereal, ransack the cupboards for any other source of sugar. Within minutes to an hour, I would consume the caloric intake of a small village. The cycle would then proceed to be placed on repeat like your favorite new song, that never seems to escape your head, except this song lasted 3 long years….restrict, restrict, binge, restrict, restrict, restrict, binge… and the song SUCKED!

During this time, I was trying all kinds of supplements because I thought that was the key to success that I so desperately needed. I could have been admitted into rehab as an addict for supplements. I bought every damn one that was sold protein, creatine, thermogenics, mass gainers, test boosters, pre-workout, etc. I probably boosted Bodybuilding.com’s bottom-line by about 10% during those years. I believed every hyped ad that would read/claim, “add 600% to my bench press” or “get abs in (insert insane short amount of time that is way to unrealistic…unless you’re as gullible as me)”. Still no results though….how could that be?!?

I would then sit down, cry and sulk in my room, thus proceeding to punish myself for these unacceptable results like a toddler who threw a toy at this brother. However, my body had no more to give, but I did not care….I WANTED ABS!!! So, I pushed myself harder and the world further away, more cardio even less food. Oh, and also James no going out with friends or eating at family parties because the food is not up to par for you and your abs.

This would repeat itself every weekend for several years with no end in sight. I tried IIFYM which morphed into If It Fits Your Mouth, I was scared that if I ate a reasonable amount of “normal” food I would blow up and all of my results (which was not much because my body was dead from the diet swings) would go away. I sought help and nothing seemed to work; was this ever going to end?! I thought about grabbing the Remington 870 in my room, loading a deer slug and just end it right there…..

Was there a special moment or turning point for me? No, just as slowly as it seemed to happen, it took me just as long to fix it and I am still not perfect….it is still a thought, but I have found several ways that began the transition and what I do now to conquer my inner-monster. I am still not perfect; it’s still something I battle. I now use it as a joke…I powerlift for pancakes or do deadlifts for doughnuts and other similar silly/stupid phrases to play off the love of food and iron.

This journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want to help other learn from me. Late in 2014 I created my YouTube channel to share my story and these lessons. As of February 2016 I just began publishing videos about the story I detailed above. It took me some time to get the self-confidence and courage to talk publicly about it. Most men, don’t dare to talk about eating disorders even though it’s prominent in the fitness industry due to the promotion of unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyles. I first heard of this issue with women in bikini and figure competitions from Layne Norton, so yes it’s seemed girly. Since, no one else wants to be blunt and upfront I will. I have been teased and ripped up, but I am still standing so not much will phase me at this point.

My channel is small nothing crazy about 60 subscribers and most videos get about 10-20 views within a month of the upload. However this video almost reached 100 views in a week (that’s a PR..PRs are not only in the gym but life too!) and the amount of emails, friend requests on MyFitnessPal, questions, and the skype calls have occurred quicker than I ever expected from total strangers. I will continue to publish more details about my story in the time to follow and answer questions. I am currently in the process of opening a website (the one you are reading) and blog to help others more directly than via YouTube.

In addition, to sharing the “tricks” I learned to kill my binge eating monster and not myself. My first lesson was on supplements: what I learned from research and my experiences. I created a ranking scheme to help explain my point:

Worth The Money

Worth The Money If You Can Afford It

Marketing Scam…RUN!

I also began to only support serious supplement companies. Like 1st Phorm, ones that are reputable, they create honest products, they don’t spike their numbers, and they actually represent what the hell fitness is meant to be. Too many companies are about making a quick buck off the ignorant and uneducated (i.e. ME). They promote fitness as this vanity thing, like abs are the key to happiness. That people with abs are better than you. Let me tell you…that’s crap!! Fitness is not about looks, it’s about changing who you are from the inside...not the out. After this whole experience, I stand by that claim!

I am now proud to say I am a USAPL competitor because I FREAKIN love it, not because I want to be strong or look good (I am over that). Lord knows, if I didn’t love it then I am not squatting, benching, and deadlifting four days a week at five in the morning. I have also made the successful transition to an IIFYM lifestyle. I have not prepped a meal in over 300 days and counting!

This industry has changed me…for the better (finally). I used to be the laziest kid as evidence by my fat slothful (called husky to be polite) youth. Now, I won’t be outworked by a soul. I am dumb or crazy enough (depends how you look at it) to chase my crazy dreams and have experienced some success since learning about my full potential through powerlifting these include, but no limited to:

Summa Cum Laude B.S. Civil Engineering, Spring 2016 
3 Different Business Ventures Under Construction 
Pancakes &amp; Powerlifting 
Wolf of Scholarships (teach college students how to win scholarships…I won 50K) 
StructuralMD (small business with a professor and 2 friends) Learning to Trade Stocks Part-Time…why because I love to learn a new challenge

I am here to teach you these lessons and have a positive influence, I don’t want you to kill your opportunities like I almost did. My journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want you to learn from me, because those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it.

The project’s theme is “life is better on the other side” and the title is “I am not Ed.” As many of you know, when you're suffering with an ED, it’s your entire identity. We want to show some of the great things that happen when an eating disorder no longer defines who you are.

This project is personal to me because I suffered with bulimia from the age of 15-23 and was hospitalized three times. I'm now a happy, healthy 45-year-old mother of two.

We’re hoping to get people to post photos of themselves holding a card that says #IamnotEd, and a caption incorporating the three sentences below.

I AM NOT ED

I am _________________ (a mother, an athlete, a confident woman, …)

When I let go of ________________ (obsessing about weight, bingeing and purging, being ashamed of my body…)

I was able to _____________ (go swimming for the first time in years, have a healthy relationship, eat with other people, create two amazing kids,…)

The inspiration is a blend of the Humans of New York photo series, and the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.

To kick it off, we'd like at least 20 photos and captions from people willing to make a statement about how life is better on the “other side” of recovery. With that as a foundation, hopefully it can spread across social media with people all over the country contributing (possibly including celebrities).
Would you be willing to participate? You do not have to give your name.

Please email your selfie and sentences to me at cindy@frac.tl. We'll be building an ""I Am Not Ed"" landing page, and I'll share the link as soon as we have it up and running.

Keep It Simple Stupid

Love yourself. Simple right? Perhaps the worst thing about this cycle was I hated myself, I hated my life, I did not want  to look in the mirror, I thought I was a failure that I would never make it, I contemplated suicide. When I would binge, I would punish myself. Don’t do that we are human, life is meant to be enjoyed. Life is much too short to never treat yourself to what you love to eat whatever that maybe for you. Again Keep It Simple Stupid. Look yourself in the mirror directly into your eyes saying “I LOVE myself” at least 10 times a day, if not more. P.S. try not to smile when you say this (harder than you think).

You can eat whatever you want just not all at once. I believe I heard Layne Norton say this, I believe this, like the 11th commandment, in fact it should be an amendment to the constitution. When I first began to escape cycle, I would eat one “treat” at every meal. Nothing crazy, but it will allow you still get your “fix” but you won’t binge on it. Any action in the right direction gave me more motivation and encouragement to keep in proving. The small wins kept snowballing into large victories later that slammed the door on binging.

Going along the line of K.I.S.S, I did this with my meal planning, no more crazy spreadsheets and tracking of nutrients line item by line item like an accountant. I did not worry about counting calories and the works. I would instead eat (3) meals, breakfast, lunch and supper possibly a snack if I was hungry. I would eat slowly, and as I began to feel fuller I would stop eating. My metabolism was so out of whack that the slightest improvement had drastic results.

180, 190, 160, 225, 200…what number was it going to be today I thought I as I closed my eyes scared to look down at the scale after a night of binging (these were all weights I reached during this cycle). You do not need a scale to help you. It’s about small wins, small wins, they add up trust me; I have been there too.


So, what about eating at restaurants and parties? Parties were my kryptonite, the amount of food that I saw and I thought I had to eat three people’s worth of everything. What helped me to win at parties was I made this a game in my head (who cares no one else knows..plus now you know I did it). I am very competitive; I hate losing even if it’s go fish with a girlfriend (I will be a terrible father I will never let my kids win). Since eating slower and not getting seconds was a struggle at first. The game I created was to be the last one done eating, and the last one to get seconds. This helped me in many ways, first to help me eat slower I talked with people, this helped to repair the relationships I had damaged in the past, plus I was not over eating (win/win). Which is why I was last to get seconds, so often I would eat so quick that my stomach didn’t even know it was fed until I was already 4-5 plates of heaping food deep.

Train for fun! For so long in this process I trained for results no I do not mean goals; I simply worked out to look good that’s it! It was the complete wrong direction, it made training no fun, I dreaded every gym session, and was having a miserable time. It doesn’t matter if you are into bodybuilding, figure, physique, cross fit, powerlifting, strongman, marathons, etc. just train for fun, train to get better and challenge yourself. For me this was powerlifting.

I began to cry happy tears as I feel asleep. This journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want you to learn from me, because those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it. I ruined my relationship with friends, missed out on memories, lost a girlfriend, and almost my life. You are a winner you can do this, I believe in you.

If you could please email me at jahillegas@gmail.com with your thoughts, comments, questions I would greatly appreciate it! I am considering opening on business to help others overcome this problem and would love your feedback!

43y646,1454473174,"I'm certainly not the first person this has happened to. But I never thought it would happen again. I was bulimic 15-17 then stopped cold turkey and never looked back. My eating disorder continued to evolve and teetered between anorexia, restrictive eating, over exercising, and binging. But I never purged. I've had the overwhelming urge to during certain stressful uncontrollable moments in my life, and have maybe a handful of time over the 8-year dry spell when drunk (mostly justifying it because I couldn't inhibit the urge and to get the alcohol up). I can't say exactly what's started it up now almost a decade later, and so suddenly. I've been through periods of extreme stress before and my eating disorder always manifested into unintentional anorexia during the worst moments. This time, the bulimia happened almost voluntarily and naturally, like an old friend taking my hand again and leading the way. I started seeing someone new, and having a lot of intimate, body-exposing sex. I can recognize I felt vulnerable, and scared. I didn't want to be in such an open and close relationship with someone and it was happening out of my control. But it still surprises me that this is how I've chosen to handle it because I've been in, arguably, more stressful situations than this and it's been different. I think im unable to recognize my emotions and what they mean, where they come from. I never wanted this to happen again. Now I've been trapped for almost a month, purging at least once a day, if not more. I'm spending an incredible amount of money on food, eating until I'm in physical pain, and vomiting for hours. My mouth, throat, and fingers are raw. I dread him seeing my body. I've gained weight. I feel disgusted and out of control. I'm so scared because I can't stop it, the urge is so overwhelming it's almost unquestionable. I've been wasting so much time on this cyclical, destructive behaviour that it's put me behind school and added to my stress, which has only made it worse. I want this to stop so badly, I'm so lost. I don't know who to turn to and I can't afford to be going through this right now. This disease consumed 2 years of my life and put everything - my friends, family, school - all aside so It could fully preoccupy my time. Getting out of it was the best release that ever happened. I went right into an anorexic phase, followed by other things...but for the most part, I've been mostly recovered, accepting that the obsessing and anxiety over food, and occasional restriction and control, is just a natural curse that I have to live with. But this is unbearable and it's cutting into my life and well being. I just want to understand why it started again so suddenly, and with such a vengeance, and how to escape before he next two-or more years of my life are flushed down the toilet.",-0.1777269009533721,edsupport

3frprt,1438709017,"Hello :)
I wanted to share this here in case anyone may benefit from it. 
I started a blog about my recovery from anorexia. I talk about my own experiences with anxiety, an eating disorder, and my attempts at self-acceptance. I thought I'd share the link in case anyone may end up reading it and identifying with anything I've written. My blog posts tend to be long &amp; I've done them for a little while now, but I figured I'd share it just in case, by some miracle, someone feels helped or understood by it. I also write about my opinions and experiences as well. Even though I highly doubt any of it is really read by anyone, it still always feels good to write!
I'm not fully recovered yet but I'm getting treated for anorexia right now and am on my path to getting better. I've had this disorder for many years and I compiled a list of activities/things that I have found super helpful in recovery! 
Certain posts could potentially be triggering, I do make sure that I don't say any numbers (I don't mention amounts of calories or weight) but I don't know what may or may not trigger some individuals! I do write this blog with the intention of reaching out to others who are struggling too so I hope it is not at all doing the opposite of what I intend!

I’ve been fighting this (anorexia) since I was 12 and everyone always told me if I just worked hard and followed the rules I wouldn’t have this ruining my life as an adult but here we are. My graduation has been pushed back another semester, I have another semester of Ws and once again all that hard work I did in treatment last time is doing nothing for me. I was in and out from 9th grade through age 21 then after the worst relapse I've ever had and 5 months inpatient I finally went a year in recovery. But now, I'm almost 23 and living with my parents because I ended up in the hospital with a feeding tube again. Every time things start going well and I get a taste of the life I’ve been promised I end up back here; when is it time to say that enough is enough?

My mom said something along the lines of “well whether or not you achieve is in your control” which just felt shitty; like I guess I’m just not trying hard enough. 

I have great grades, research experience, publications, conference presentations and EVERYTHING I need to be a competitive candidate for Ivy league PhD programs but I'm so scared that I am going to squander everything.

edig9t,1576887460,"I developed an eating disorder in 4th grade. I remember being proud of drinking nothing but water all day and having nothing more than a few carrots to eat. I did it because I was the fat friend. I was always bigger than my friends, and I wasn't even that big. I was a bit chubby. I need exercise, that's all, looking back it was nothing more than baby fat. Since 4th grade my eating habits have been been highly restrictive but its come and go in waves. By middle school I was crying about being led on by boys more than I was about my body. Sophomore year of high school I relapsed and spent every day and hour of my life dedicated to loosing weight. I went vegetarian to justify restrictions, I started hiking and swimming constantly, and I wouldn't bring money or food to school so I had no option but to starve. My parents noticed and sent me to therapy. I had an emotional break down and I stopped restricting cold turkey the summer before junior year. Flash forward 4 years and here I am sitting in my livingroom crying because I ate rice for dinner. I thought I was better but the reality is I'm not. My 4th semester of college triggered something in me. Something changed about how I view my peers and now I feel like eyes are on me. I have a lot of high expectations being placed on me and I feel like a failure. I'm starving myself because if I cant be academically successful I can at least make myself physically attractive in some way. Or that's how I'm justifying it. I dont think I will ever be ""attractive"" but maybe I won't be fat. Fatphobia is something my mom ingrained in my brain as a kid and now I am panicking about potentially being fat. I don't know how years of recovery was undone so suddenly. I feel in control and it feels good, I feel clean, I feel worthy of some kind of attention. I've lost weight and people have noticed. ""You look good!"" ""You finally lost your baby fat!"" My friends have kept quiet but to other people I'm fair game. I'm being picked apart and the more it happens the worse I feel about what I'm doing to myself. I'm still young. I'm barely 20. I'm still in college and I'm still dependent on my parents in many ways. Maybe I'm not really an adult and I'm still a kid who doesn't know any better. I feel like the same little girl who would scroll through tumblr for hours triggering myself so that I wouldn't be tempted to eat something as calorically insignificant as an apple. Maybe I just need some of that ""real world"" responsibility my parents constantly tell me about. I dont know. I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I look like hell.

ecwv9k,1576778634,"I am 28 F. I've never been diagnosed with an ED but I've had a lifelong issue with my weight and body and most of all, food.

Since joining this community and many others, I suspect that I may have a form of BED. I am normal weight 21 BMI, and I've never really intentionally purged.

My life revolves around food to the point that it annoys others. I think about dinner in the early mornings already. When I restrict to about 750 calories I do incredibly well and lose quickly, but the binges make me crazy. I'll eat until I am in physical pain and feel sick. I hate myself so much after one of these. 

I'm so scared to talk to someone about it as I feel like I haven't been diagnosed and they might think I'm looking for attention.

TW: self harm and calories




Today is bad. I got some crappy news about my financial situation. All due to stupid mistakes and not knowing and not having proper guidance.  My accountant says it’s fixable, but the amount of stress (debt, like, a lot) coming my way is a mountain I feel I cannot climb.




I’ve been trying to better myself, started exercising recently, been trying to get back into shape because I’ve been in pain from sitting around being depressed. I used to be very active in my job and now I’ve been sitting and driving a lot and my body hurts. I’m not the heaviest I’ve ever been, but I hate the way clothes feel, I’m self conscious, bloated all the time, and every time I try to make a change I fail and binge. 




After the bad news I waited a while and then put a small nick on the top of my forearm, under where my watch sits so hopefully my BF won’t see it.  It didn’t release any of the emotion I was hoping it would.  Stupid. 




I’m 30. I’ve gone between purging and heavy restricting and binging and semi-recovery for the last 15 years. I should fucking know better by now.  Lately I feel like I’m relapsing. On NYE this year I will have 5 years of sobriety, so at least there is that.  After today I feel like I may as well go home and ration out my food that I have because I will barely be able to afford anything now. I’ll have to quit vaping too , and cable, internet at home maybe, other things, because I can’t afford it.  I have zero assets to sell. I need to have a windfall of cash to make this go away.  




The fucked up part is - I feel happy that I might actually have a way to get super thin and small by force of poverty. 




I don’t know why I’m posting this except needing to vent. I can’t think straight right now.  Paralyzed with fear.  Thanks for reading. Xoxo",-2.97414111777739,EdAnonymousAdults

ec2kur,1576619223,"I've been in outpatient treatment for my ED since September. I've done formal treatment before, but only on an adolescent track. My therapist refuses to discuss anything other than my eating habits, and only seems interested in setting up a ""goal"" for how much I would eat in a day. And I was confused by this because I also see a dietician at this clinic, and it seems like it would be more in their area of expertise. 

Our sessions devolved into her basically saying ""just eat lmao"" and that it's gonna ""suck for a while"" but that I just need to sit on my feelings about it. And I'm just like??? WHY am I bothering to see you if you're just gonna tell me I have to eat, and not address anything else. She refuses to discuss anything like emotional regulation or coping mechanisms I could use and then treats me like I'm a problem patient when I don't make progress.

e9knfl,1576137057,"So I’ve struggled with anorexia (b/p subtype) off and on for 10 years. In my late 20s. I’ve recently hit a new low this year, thanks to plummeting into a depression that has killed all my motivation, creativity and drive. I’m a musician and have stopped playing or writing. Throughout my 20s I was at least able to maintain some semblance of normalcy while keeping my disorder at bay and not letting it consume me entirely, my worst fear has always been losing my identity to my disorder. I used to want to pursue music, make things, be someone. Now I just want to lose weight, b/p, restrict, isolate and sleep. 
Now here I am almost 30 and still struggling, just as bad as I was back then but this time I have a partner, a job, a dog and bills to pay. I feel like such a failure. I work in a chaotic restaurant which also fuels my disorder in many ways (I grew up in chaos so it’s very familiar) and isn’t good for my mental health long term. I feel like I have lost my purpose in life and I no longer know who I am. A big part of me really wants to go back to school but it’s been so long and I am afraid of debt and not being smart enough. I’m at my lowest weight right now but because I’m short/petite it’s not super obvious. Which I hate. 
My partner basically gave me an intervention today, telling me that now is the time to get treatment so I can get better and we can plan for our future. I feel so guilty and scared. I don’t feel sick enough to deserve to go to treatment and I never have. But if I wanted to go, I could and I am lucky to have that option.

e9borm,1576092120,"I have a good friend who also has/had an ED and is currently recovering. She knows I have an ED. But I haven’t really been 100% upfront about the fact that I’m not ready to recover yet and this has turned each time I spend with her into an anxiety inducing event. 

For instance, whenever I see her there is always some type of fear food that she is eating that I am also expected to eat. If we go out for breakfast, She almost expects me to order the pancakes and potatoes since I’m supposedly “recovering”. If I go to her house, there’s always full fat and full sugar hot chocolate waiting. And if I don’t eat it, I feel I will be judged. Not only that, but I also feel that by not eating these foods to “show off” how “recovered” I am, that I am somehow affecting her recovery. She has told me before that when she eats food around other people, she will only order fear foods if the person with her (I.e., me) orders them too. She might want the pancakes but will not order them unless I do, so I feel pressure to order food I don’t want to eat in order to make her happy. Meanwhile I’m eating pancakes when I would much rather be eating a veggie egg white omelette.

I’m the one causing all this, I know. I don’t know why I can’t be honest with her about not being ready to recover. It is probably because she discovered her ED a short while before I discovered that I had mine- I was there supporting her and encouraging her recovery, and now that I am in the same situation she was in I don’t want to recover.

e679y4,1575498974,"I'm new here, but pre recovery I was in the old sub, so hi again everyone! 

I'm in recovery, or at least trying, however I recently developed lactose intolerance and am finding it almost impossible to be vigilant of dairy without involving calories. I cant eat dairy, but can have as many calories as I'd like, and as a result I ""binge"" lactose foods regardless of calories. Maybe I'm complaining of green grass but it's really hard. The same ED logic that fed by binges is feeding me dairy, which wouldn't be too problematic if I didnt have a health issue (Crohns) which means lactose results in internal bleeding. I know that sounds crazy, but my nurse and other subreddits have testified it can happen.

I suppose I'm looking for advice. Avoiding lactose has taken the same role as avoiding calories or fat, I'm terrified and feel ""pure"" when I avoid it, but as a result ""binge"" it because I miss it so much.

I don't know how to manage this. I'm waiting for an assessment by mental health services, but until then its ruling my life.

I scheduled the appointment thinking that I'm too old and too fat for this (mid-30s, about 16.5 BMI), but it is impacting my life to a degree I've only recently admitted, and maybe they'll let me join a weekly group or something. I was stunned when the assessor recommended day treatment, with the qualification that she would've said residential or even inpatient had I not emphasized how important it is for me to be home evenings with my young kids. Looks like I'll start next week; good thing I have lots of PTO stored up. 

Thanks to you all for listening. There are probably many of you who've also perpetuated certain habits for so long that they don't really feel disordered...perhaps this is partly because popular and scholarly of coverage of eating disorders tends to focus on extreme short-term behaviors versus chronic, relatively mild ones that nevertheless accumulate.* But I hope that posting this might light a small flame for someone else to seek help.

I'm turning 37 in a few months and I've had some form of ED since I was 11. That is way too many years to be living this way, but I don't know wtf ""normal"" is after 25+ years and fear that I never will. I'm starting to think this is my lot in my life and I just have to learn to cope with it the best I can.

I've tried therapy and recovery more times than I care to remember. I just went through a lightning phase of B/P and now I'm back on in my ""safe"" restriction zone again. I have gained and lost the same x pounds for... *years*, my god. I'm currently creeping towards UW but that is where I feel safest and I'm terrified of even trying to gain any sense of normality because of weight gain.

The most successful recovery attempt was over spring/summer, when I stopped weighing/counting calories and focused on getting strong (i.e., weight lifting) and eating what I imagine is ""normal"". I was doing well for about 12 weeks, but the changes in my body freaked me out and I couldn't get past that short term transition phase. A full-on relapse came on when I decided to log my calories of ""normal"" eating and basically got sticker shock at the result. So I undid all of that work by going back to restriction and lost a ton of weight in a short amount of weeks.

I am just... so SO tired of living this way. Food and calories on my mind 24/7. Body checking every time I'm in front of a mirror. Freaking out when friends or family want to go out to eat because how tf am I supposed to know the exact calorie count?

I’ve pretty much stayed away from laxatives and diet pills except for caffeine pills, but really been considering them lately as a bit of a last resort. Everything I’ve read has said laxatives don’t do anything lasting and it’s just lost water weight, (plus the fear of shitting myself in public lol) makes me apprehensive to try them. 
I’ve always been interested in making the plunge to try dnp which I know is a dangerous game to play, especially for us ED community. My thought process is I’d spend the same amount of money over time on otc diet pills that don’t do much, or I could micro dose dnp for the same amount with hopefully better results (obviously at the much greater risk). I’m not sure which is more worth it. Was wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience on the matter by chance?

My therapist was surprised when I mentioned not only that I have never been medicated but that I have never been to a psychiatrist at all. She says I should consider getting and appointment. I refused at first because I feel like I don't deserve help, like I am not sick enough to justify the high costs of the sessions and possible meds. But I have seen a lot of people here mention that too, and I feel it might be a part of my disorder? Like if this illness were a little demon controlling me from the inside, he wouldn't want me to get better! So maybe I should go even if I don't think I deserve help.

I've had the nexplannon (arm implant) for a little over a year. My doctor said weight gain is a common side effect for people who are already overweight. I wasn't concerned since I was just hovering the underweight/normal weight bmi line, and a little to give to not worry about pregnancy and bad sides effects of periods. 
I think life circumstances make sense to factor in as far as weight gain on birth control goes, but I hadn't really noticed any weight until 3 months later at my psychiatrist, I was up about 7 lbs. I was trying to recover, and had been in a ""recovery"" state for 2 years, so I didnt have a scale at home. It bothered me, although I was not in anyway shape or form overweight, just higher than I (or ED brain) prefer myself to be at. My weight fluctuates and yes, my period brings about a  difference in my daily weight. 
But I've been tracking weight and diet for the past two months, as well as staying active, (maybe using some ed behaviors) everyday but haven't seen the scale drop to where I find myself comfortable. It's like there is a point where my weight doesnt budge. I've also been dealing with unpleasant side effects of the bc in my cycles. 
I'm thinking I should call my doctor and try to see about removal and where that would leave me. I've tried almost every bc on the market and nothing works well with my body. It's so frustrating.

My partner’s work schedule is odd enough that we don’t have many meals together (really just breakfast and neither of us are breakfast eaters) so I don’t have to hide my intake.

Maybe it’s years of being into fitness and clean eating, but I can’t really tell the difference between disciplined eating and “eating normally” anymore. 

I just fall back on my “safe food list” and “x mins of exercise per day” to feel okay, or at least something. 

Even my boss gave me the feedback that other colleagues do think I’m weird “to eat so religiously”. 

But it gives me so much comfort to fall back on a system that is “productive” and clean and in essence, “good”.

My average weight has not changed much since I was 20 and I’m happy with my body and efforts thus far - esp since it’s the only thing I can fall back on when my life seems out of control.

Feeding my cats every day makes me feel better about not eating because they’re well fed.

I definitely overfeed my cats and give them as many treats as they want because I know they don’t care about getting fat and I want them to enjoy every second of their existence cos mine sucks.

I only came to this conclusion because of cannabis and EDM. 
I was using cannabis to help me drink and eat. Once a day,at night.

I pushed myself so far out of my comfort zone and went to an EDM festival at the end of August, and I experienced genuine love and connection and allowed myself to be open to being vulnerable. I have never felt so free to be myself. It was a safe space for me. I experienced trust and happiness and cried and laughed and I was able to experience what I felt before all the bad things started happening at 6 years old. 

I got back home and went back to “normal life”. 

Cannabis. Toked. Ate the safe food. 
I turned on music that was different than I normally listen to while high. and it made me far more emotional. I shut it off and changed it but the thought loop stayed constant. it then only turned into one word. Shame. 

And literally yesterday morning I came out publicly as queer/pan. I used to identify as a lesbian, and held a lot of shame from being attracted to men. 

And after, I broke down while eating safe food (while sober) on the way to work &amp; just allowed myself to sob. wanted to find peace - not wanting to die. It was jarring. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. At that festival, I experienced love and acceptance not on the basis of my identity for the first time in my life, and understood that love should not be contingent based on whether you match societal standards (or marginalized groups’ standards because wow, the insidious behavior literally creates shame). 

I’m petrified. 

I don’t want to die - I want to live so I can produce edm - bass music/dubstep - and help bring moments of solace to others in a therapeutic way. 

I don’t want to die, and that’s my motivation to heal completely. Because I want to reach people in a way that works with my energy &amp; amplifies it.",-2.527376357301591,EdAnonymousAdults

dfe4rl,1570609693,"I feel that my disordered eating is always secondary to my other mental health problems, and it's mostly a symptom than a cause. I have borderline personality disorder and complex PTSD. I've never been diagnosed with any eating disorder as its never been obviously visable but have struggled for a long time. 

My trauma is ultimately the cause for my mental health problems and BPD is the way it presents itself. Woven into that my disordered eating is reflective of my unstable sense of self, tendency to self harm, impulsivity (binging and intense exercise etc) and emotional disregulation.  In times of restriction I am usually not as depressed, but have more 'anxious' energy and I'm looking to control my environment and distract myself from my stressors. In times of overeating I'm usually more depressed and actively suicidal.

It’s been a year since I began therapy and was diagnosed with bulimia. It’s been 8 months since I’ve acted on my compulsion to purge, aside from a few minor episodes. It’s been literally ZERO seconds since I’ve felt like shit over it. 

I’m so, so, so fucking miserable and done with feeling this way. This feels harder and less natural than my old ways of just eating...and then throwing up. 

My entire day is full of intrusive thoughts, every meal is followed by intense guilt and anxiety.. it doesn’t feel like it’s getting easier, it feels like it’s becoming more and more difficult and it’s bleeding into my entire life. 

I feel like I am one big walking eating disorder and that’s all that I am. It consumes me. 

I am a fucking adult...with a family and a job and all these responsibilities and tiny people who look up to me.... but I feel like a child about this. Like what is wrong with me?! Why can’t I just enjoy going to dinner with my family, without having to fake happy the whole time? Why can’t I actually enjoy a beautiful meal? 

I’ve gained 15 lbs in the last year, which makes me so sad. At a healthy normal BMI, everyone says I look great, but my dysmorphia is so intense that I barely can look at my naked body. I can barely tolerate my clothes body, and I feel constantly uncomfortable about myself. 

I showered with my husband last night and all I could think about was how repulsive I must look, even though all he’s ever done is lust after me for 8 years now. Even though I see beautiful bodies in all shapes and sizes around me, I can’t have an ounce of appreciation for my own.

I've struggled with anorexia and ednos on and off since I was about 14 (I'm in my mid/late 20s now). I've been more or less in recovery for a few years, with minor slip-ups here and there. Periodically I freak out about my weight and start counting calories again, obsessing about the gym, you know the drill. 

Anyway, I'm starting a new job that requires more formal attire, so today I was trying on some old clothes that I wore \~5 years ago in a job where I had to dress similarly. The clothes are a bit tight and one dress that used to fit me like a glove won't even zip. I'm at a healthy weight for my height (pretty much right smack in the middle, BMI-wise), but I can't stop feeling like a failure for having gained weight over the past few years. I also feel like such an idiot for still caring about this so much that it's taken up hours of my afternoon. 

Can anyone relate to this? I feel crazy and pathetic.",-2.507832701391294,EdAnonymousAdults

Like most things Ed I really have no where else to share it. I believe in The Lord. I'm not overzealous but I do genuinely do the best I can as far a principle of religion. Even with my ednos. I was very bad Bulimia, anorexic, ednos about nine years ago. I was a mess internally,  But physically I (can hindsight see that) I was looking very good.  I always was a caring person, very sensitive type about myself and others who were oppressed throughout the world(like most people). I was never in a real position to help anyone. I struggled to keep myself taken care of on the most basic level. I eventually joined a religion and one day after a delicious meal I was purging looking into the depths of the  toilet (as usual) with my fingers down my throat, and I thought of a random starving baby/toddler I had seen on a ""Save the children type commercial"". Like so skinny arms and legs with a huge distended belly. The kid was wondering around looking for food in a dirt field. I'm here hunched over trying to throw mine up. I decided then and there that I keep my food in my belly when it goes down. If I put it in I have to keep it .Almost as a charity, for that that kid. My rule now is if it goes down I have to keep it for starving people worldwide. But I can exercise/restrict as as long as I want to get it off (and I definitely do).

Another sub  a few days ago, but I thought I'd ask here as well.

Im currently just trying to get up to a ""healthier"" weight with the hope I might get my period back. My first goal is 100lb, meaning I am roughly 5lb away from this goal. I have been through recovery before, once in hospital, then on my own and I know that weight will first go to my stomach to protect organs, and eventually it redistributes. 

My worry is that 5lb won't be enough of a difference for my body to redistribute the fat away from my stomach. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

cifabb,1564217845,"I turned 30 this year. So far I've accomplished absolutely nothing in my life, except staying alive but even that I can't take much credit for. Been dealing with this shit since I was 12, 13. Diagnosed with Anorexia at 19, then in and out of hospital during my twenties. As a result I don't have any of the ""normal"" life experiences that you're supposed to have. College drop-out. I haven't been working. Just a bunch of experiences I wish I didn't have, and a life I shouldn't have lived. I don't get to be who I should have been or live the life I should have lived. How do you reconcile with that?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finally at a point where I'm kind of doing better. I've managed to get my weight up a bit. Sometimes I think that I could maybe, possibly, end up having a future and some kind of meaningful life. And then the fear and anxiety sets in and I just end up paralyzed. I'm so terrified of rejection, of having other people confirm that I'm every bit as useless as I feel that I am. How do you move on from that? How do you rebuild a life when there's no foundation to fall back on? I'm pretty much a complet waste of space and resources, why would anyone hire or educate or date me?

I obsessed about it everyday. 

I have since been doing ""OMAD"" and the weight started to drop off. The compliments started happening. I remembered how good it was to feel empty.

Laxatives came back into my vocabulary. Then calorie counting...

I've now eaten my one meal a day, but I have the compulsion to purge it right away. And I have done this 4 days consecutively. AT WORK.

bh25nv,1556152064,"This might be a long post.


I was diagnosed and went into IOP treatment for anorexia when I was sixteen and a sophomore in high school, and continued going to therapy and doctors appointments at that same treatment center for about a year after that. Once I was about a senior, my mom decided I could stop going to therapy because she felt like I had improved. She was still prepping my meals and whatnot, and monitored my weight and what I was eating pretty closely. My mental state was pretty terrible, I felt extremely uncomfortable with the weight gain.


I gradually think I lost a few pounds naturally here and there as I entered my freshman year of college, as my mom and I had started going on hour long walks again, (we used to do this during the eating disorder but stopped once I entered treatment) and I wasn't eating as strictly as I had been. I was on the lower end of a healthy weight for my height, and the weight loss wasn't really intentional. 


I got my first boyfriend my freshman year of college, and he ended up cheating on me in the summer. I kind of spiraled, and lost a bit more weight. I am now a sophomore in college and I at some points this year I have been at or near the same weight I was when I went into treatment the first time. 


However, I went through January deciding I wanted to just gain a few pounds and not have such a rigid schedule with food- I was tired of food controlling my life, so I decided to try and eat a bit more. I'm not sure if extreme hunger is a real phenomenon, but that entire month was sort of spent overeating (possibly binging?) and my mom took notice and confronted me. She thought I needed to see a therapist.


I don't necessarily feel out of control when I'm eating, but I feel like I need to make the most of the times I slip up because I'm not going to let myself eat that food again very often. Most of the time I also feel hungry. I know the solution to this would just be to work on intuitive eating and fixing my relationship with food, but I have a routine of foods I like to eat.

So I've been seeing my therapist, and I went back to watching my food intake for the last three months because I want to get back to a lower weight and I feel embarrassed about my mom catching me eating so much. I haven't brought up the eating disorder issues with the therapist even though I know I should, because I'm afraid of change. Right now I feel like I can go back to the anorexia whenever I want and I don't want that control taken away.


The past week I feel like I've started to overeat again, and I don't know why. I'm afraid I'm developing binge eating disorder. Could that be it, or is my body just craving the things I have been restricting from it for three years? Ever since I stopped going to the treatment center I have eaten pretty clean, I still avoid a lot of foods like cookies, candy, ice cream, etc. I tend to eat the same things every day and I never let myself have treats.


I don't know what to do. I feel like food controls my entire life, and it's all I think about every day. I just turned twenty one, and I feel like I'm still caught up with issues other girls my age have gotten over because I'm still obsessed with being skinny, and I only like myself when I'm a certain weight.


I know the logical answer would be to open up to my therapist and get help, but I just want to keep the illusion of the control of choices I have. I know anorexia is controlling me though.",-3.3791167437162417,EdAnonymousAdults

besx6z,1555633659,"I've had an ED for 15 years. I've had periods of remission, but for the past 5-6 years things have been pretty bad. My treatment team wants to admit me to inpatient again for a week and then do PHP. I feel so pathetic. I've done PHP and inpatient so many times. I have all the programming memorized. I could probably teach DBT. I use the skills everyday. My depression is well controlled. But I can't let go of the ED. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in grad school. In another year I'll have my doctorate. I'm near the top of my class. People tell me I'm charismatic, smart, at work everyone comes to me with their problems. Meanwhile I'm sneaking off to the bathroom to purge and/or throwing away the salad I carefully weighed out. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't get over the fear I'll look fat, average, ordinary, if I recover and gain weight. But I also wear baggy clothes and thick knits to hide my weight loss. I'm a walking contradiction.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to try anymore. Let this disease take me where it will. I was reading a book about the medical consequences of eating disorders and the author talks about focusing on palliative care after age 30 and it crushed me. I think of the patients both old and young that I've taken care of who've had to transition to palliative care and/or hospice once we realized our treatments and tests were doing more harm than good. Am I at that stage?

&amp;#x200B;

Both my younger siblings are getting married this year and will also soon have their graduate degrees. They are starting families and professional lives. Meanwhile I just want to withdraw from the world so I hurt as few people as possible once I'm finally gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to think I was jealous, that I longed to start a family of my own. Now I abhor the thought. There is no way I could guarantee I could be present and healthy to raise a child to adulthood. I would fail that innocent child.

&amp;#x200B;

No, it is better this way, living alone in my tiny apartment with my cat, with my boyfriend a 4 hour drive away so he can't see the day-to-day wasteland of my life.

bcwdhf,1555196274,"Yesterday I tried to have a chill day. I slept in because no work, ran my errands in the afternoon, begged off a trip I didn’t want to take anymore and met my fiancé for froyo Friday (fkk yea).  

Then my fiancé goes, ‘Hey let’s grab a pint with so-and-so.’  Completely disregarding the fact that I am trying to drink less because fkk me I spent the night in the drunk tank last week. So this was where yesterday went horribly off track. One pint turned into two turned into going to so-and-so’s place for tequila turned into me waking up disoriented and still tipsy on so-and-so’s sofa with no recollection of anything that happened after tequila drink #2. 

So feeling overwhelmingly guilty and ashamed of myself, I did the only sensible thing and immediately went home to take a shower. 

Then, like a sensible person, I realized I needed to feed myself or else the hangover would be ridiculous. So I went to the grocery store. 

Cut to now. I have cooked and eaten a frittata that was huge enough to feed three people. I have also cooked and eaten an entire frozen cauliflower pizza.  I have also cooked and eaten 6 lbs of battered and fried cod.  I’m considering going out to the store again for more food (because $40 worth of food was not enough for my lizard brain and now I want a milkshake AND a smoothie AND mac and cheese with sliced up hotdogs and broccoli AND bagels with cream cheese AND a whole loaf of sourdough AND). I have also had three glasses of juice and 6 cups of tea. 

But it’s okay. I’m a Recovered Anorexic. I couldn’t possibly be Binging because Anorexics don’t do that.  My relationship with food is perfectly healthy because I am an Adult now and that’s why yesterday I cleaned a month’s worth of stashed food wrappers out of my car that I was hiding from my fiancé (because why would he care what I’m eating?).  I no longer exhibit disordered behaviors and that’s why my response to shame and guilt over my nonexistent alcoholism is to engage in gorging my fat ass and then question wether my neighbors would be upset if I threw the packaging away in their bins so that my fiancé doesn’t find out how much I ate (because again why would he care what I shove in my face hole?).

Hi, I’m monkeymo and I’m a Recovered Anorexic Adult and this is me adulting really hard with lots of self care things like taking a shower and eating tasty food and diddling myself and eating tasty food and napping and eating tasty food and eating tasty food and eating tasty food and eating tasty food and-

My brain is just screaming that it's somehow over a thousand calories and I ruined my streak of no binging for two weeks. I binged for _months_ and I finally got back in control recently. Fuck, I hit my lowest weight since November today and I swear to god I just ruined it.

I worry my ED is at a turning point right now, and it's about to get much more strict. I feel like I can only trust packaged food, or food I make myself. I'm trying to breathe but I feel like I'm having a panic attack.

I had to spend summer in my parents' home so mia became my basic, but then the impulse of eating just to puke started to rule over me and made me gain weight at the same time it gave me ulcers. I have had them before but all the medicaments I took those times need prescription. I can not go to the hospital until I'm out of this town so what can I do, how do I stop eating to puke? How do I stop this madness pain? Last time I had a whole team of doctors giving me tons of pill so I do not even know the right one to take.

axxuif,1551871982,"I’ve been eating at 1500-2000 per day, on top of working out (which usually burns 600-800). My weight has gone down one lb, down to 126 if I really am dehydrated when I weigh myself. It’s been fucking months of this shit and no change. I’ve had what seems like textbook hypoglycemia &amp; pretty bad digestive issues for years, and my nutritionist put me on a restricted diet to see if it helped, then left because I lost most of my hours at work and can’t afford a $60 cancellation fee (20 per apt, so 3 apts worth), after my car battery died on the way to see him. I have never missed or been late for an apt, yet he’s accidentally charged me for missed apts and fucked my accounts up (hundreds of dollars I had to fight to get back). Thanks dude, thanks. 

I am so done with working my ass off to work, just to pay for food when it makes me miserable. If I don’t work one of my jobs it would just break even, problem solved. 

I am so sick of people not listening to me or telling me I eat too much, etc., when people used to leave me alone when I was a stick. And everybody is counting on me - one friend is in the hospital at ERC, one just tired to kill them selves, one just killed them selves, one losing his father and I’m over worked//trying to deal with PTSD &amp; feeling depressed as fuck. I am stretched so thin that idk if I have the capacity to deal with peoples BS

at46cf,1550761741,"I'm 28, I was ednos for many years and the last year I have attempted recovery. This has mainly consisted of not partaking in dieting and focusing on nutrition, exercise and balance. Which has been semi successful, I have had a few B/P episodes but function ok for the most part.

I am now by my own definition fat. My BMI is around 22. I have accepted body dysmorphia will always play a part in my life and am at peace with that. I have also accepted I will never reach my UGW again. 

I feel empty, neutral and can't develop a passion or interest in things. For the benefit of others I pretend to have interests/hobbies but really I dont care about anything or enjoy it. I don't feel depressed (I have been depressed and know what it feels like) just a constant flat line. 

I dont know if it is because my passion for so long was reaching that GW and now I no longer have that. Maybe I'm broken?

Has anyone else experienced this?

ar9ii2,1550329313,"I’ve been lurking here for a while now but I suppose I should tuck my pride/shame away and talk about this with people who can relate. I attended a few EA meeting years ago and the fellowship got me through a lot... Who knows? Maybe putting myself out there now could help.

For the last ten years, I’ve struggled with EDNOS. It all happened after a traumatic event in my life and... well, my father put it best when he said, “You were a sunflower. You were bright and you stood so tall. Now, it’s like you’ve wilted away.” The trauma did more than steal my confidence. It left me with a self destructive tendency that I am still battling to this day.

I’ve starved myself, binged and purged, binged and digested every single calorie, abused medications, worked out until I was kicked out of the gym, and lied to everyone about it for so long. Just ten years of yo-yoing from one extreme to the other.

Presently, I’ve been married for almost three years to the most wonderful man I’ve ever known. We’ve been best friends since I was 13 and knows me better than anyone. He’s supportive, wants the best for me, fulfills all of my social desires- we never run out of things to talk or laugh about. But he’s an emotional eater, and as I am very prone to influence, I’ve ballooned up to my heaviest weight ever. Happiness- the first true happiness I’ve felt in years- has lead to this... mess.

He’s echoed the words of my father recently; telling me he misses how confident I once was. He’s (as gently and lovingly as possible) been honest about a loss of sex appeal and worry about my weight gain. It was hard to hear it, but the words pulled the wool from my eyes and I can’t believe I’ve let this get so far out of control.

I made diet plans, restricting calories and working out but I always break. I always end up going over my intake goal. I may lose five or ten pounds, but I gain it all back. Paleo, Keto, Pescatarian, Vegetarian, 21 day... none of it sticks. I even tried to let my husband take control and plan my meals, but I couldn’t keep that up either. It’s caused some serious concerns in my marriage.

I know, now, that I desperately need to talk to someone who can help me identify the issues that stem from the trauma I experienced. Maybe it will help me understand this destructive behavior and learn to change it. But I don’t have health insurance right now and weekly therapy appointments are... so fucking expensive. 

So, I decided to go to a weight loss clinic. I am scared that I’m going to just fall back into old habits as I was prescribed Phentermine. I have every desire to use it as intended and just until I find a job with health benefits, but I keep getting these flashbacks of when I was taking several weight loss supplements at a time. You never forget what it feels like to watch your heartbeat in your chest.

...shit, this got long winded. If you’re still with me, thanks and sorry. 

I’m just here to talk to someone- which is everyone here, I guess- that can understand this struggle. The push and pull for control, the high from feeling like you’re finally holding the reigns, the fear of spiraling... and most of all, the desire to do this right and not fuck up the rest of my life.

By pressing “post”, I will officially be outside of my comfort zone, but perhaps that’s in my best interest. 

So.... 
Hello. Nice to meet you.

We’re casually talking about dietary changes (I’ve been on a doctor supervised dietary change which has impacted my fitness &amp; weight/appetite) and he comments about how we should just hit the gym more so I can ~get abs too!!! 

I know he didn’t mean it like that but it’s been a hell of a month. Not being able to eat a lot of protein like I normally do means I haven’t been able to maintain my gainz, and I’ve been super hungry (just bought 5HTP to help). I just took a nice photo with my boyfriend at a wedding - but looking at it this week, I didn’t realize how large my midsection looks in it. 

I’ve been struggling to not relapse, as I miss being underweight. I miss the high of starvation. All of this... and my best friend may be getting tubed soon, as she’s in a medical stabilization unit for her ED, and having a hard time. I’m worried about her. And I have to fly to Boston immediately after work (aka I won’t be there until 2 am) to be there for a friend whose father is dying. Recently I struggle mostly with binging but I’m having more restrictive urges now. Idk how much longer I can resist them. 

So all of this, plus a comment on my abs didn’t help. Really didn’t help. It sent me on a tail spin and I’m so ready to give up and start restricting again. Ugh.

akjf96,1548646506,"I’m curious if anybody else here grew up with stomach issues, which they think contributed to their ED. My first memory is of binge eating, and I came to find that over the years, I was more predisposed to binge eating as my stomach would “randomly” get upset, causing me to eat whenever I could manage it. Just now - at the age of 26 - I am learning what my stomach issues may be and are finding a solution. 

As a teen/young adult, I knew food would make my stomach volatile - and stress more so. Knowing such, I found it much easier to embrace disordered eating patterns as it was less likely to upset my tummy if I wasn’t eating or binge eating. I think this was a significant factor in my developing an ED, as when things got stressful I already had a poor relationship with food. 

Anybody else have this experience?

ajxowr,1548476765,"Hi all, (TW for lots of calorie talk &amp; estimation)

You may remember me from that failed recovery attempt a few weeks ago.

Well, I'm sort of half arsing it again. I've upped my calories to about 1000, haven't weighed myself but am still very bloated &amp; feel pretty nasty. I reckon that may be down to a large consumption of vegetables...

But anyway, husband is taking us (myself &amp; our daughter) out for gelato today. The menu of this place is terrifying. ""Sky scraper sundae"", ""Loaded Belgian waffle"" that sort of thing. I get that it's a ""treat"" or it's supposed to be. This is no treat for me. They don't provide nutrition or calorie information &amp; I hate that. 

The problem lies in that sure, I could use all my calories on an ice cream sundae. But then I can't eat anything else. &amp; I'm trying to eat more regularly &amp; up the calories slowly, not have one big calorie bomb.

Looking at the menu I see they do scoops of gelato in a cup. So I thought, I'll have a scoop of that. Husband insists I'm going to have 2 scoops. Okay, fine. But then can I still have my salad &amp; yogurt at dinner? Or will I be way over? *I don't know because they don't have calorie information*. It's just really frustrating me. I'm never really hungry &amp; I don't know if I'm supposed to be hungry for dinner if I had ice cream for lunch! Wtf is normal here?!

I've guessed ""a scoop"" to be 270 calories but I really have no idea &amp; feel I'm probably underestimating. I've built this up massively &amp; I'm not going to enjoy it in the slightest now &amp; I've worked myself up about it so much. I'm just really annoyed.

Apologies this is a bit of a pointless post but I just needed to tell *someone*...husband just doesn't get it!",-2.702624531171794,EdAnonymousAdults

ajof75,1548418283,"I have a problem with treatment, and having vocalized it in the past, I’ve been made to feel like I’m being a special snowflake. It drives me nuts, as I’m paying out the butt for a nutritionist, therapist, etc., yet they assume my triggers without consulting me? 

When I was in IOP, my team assumed that I was working out to compensate for my binges. When I told them time and time again that it merely helped my mood. I worked with a trainer in a residential MH program, and it changed my life in a number of ways. Being active is a very important part of my life and I really hated that they demonized that. I understand that it can effect your appetite/ED urges (so I never brought it up in groups),, but for me that was never the case &amp; wasted most of my therapy disagreeing. If anything, after a week of not working out, I get so depressed &amp; anxious my ED urges go drastically up. 

I’m seeing a nutritionist now, whom refuses to use the words “good/bad/control” because he thinks they’ll “subconsciously trigger me”, even though I’ve told him my triggers and whatnot. He has me doing unnecessary exercises &amp; continually asks me why I developed an eating disorder &amp; why I binge - which is a combination of (IMHO), anxiety/my ADHD, hormones being out of whack, and major stomach issues. If he had not been otherwise majorly helpful with my stomach issues I wouldn’t continue going. 

It’s just so frustrating! My triggers are seeing my own weight, feeling too full, over-eating, etc., and I hate the fact that people neglect this. In IOP, I was told to track my number of fats, carbs and proteins - even after explaining over and over that tracking any kind of number is really detrimental to my recovery. I never thought I was fat or ugly (well I hate my skin when I don’t take care of it but nothing pathological), yet I’m treated as though I need to work on body image and self acceptance. 

Has anybody else had this experience? I’m always very skeptical of mental health programs that claim to be individualized for that reason. 

Disclaimer: I understand that for some EDs, much like with addiction, there are strict protocols you have to follow in order to recover &amp; there’s a problem with some people, not wanting to recover &amp; deception. I just really don’t appreciate when I tell somebody who’s a MH provider my triggers, and they assume I’m lying and that’s it’s really “a, b, &amp; c”. It makes me lose hope for a sustainable, long term recovery. ",-2.4825267204697807,EdAnonymousAdults

ainfhy,1548167896,"UGH.  Since Jan 1, I've not binged once, I've been eating relatively consistently at about 1500-1600 cal a day, resisting the urge to restrict more than that to lose the 20 pounds I put on during 2018, or what I have started calling **The Year I Spent Binging and then Restricted and Overexercised To Try To Outrun My Bad Diet Even Though I Know That Doesn't Work**  (It's a long name, I'm still working on it.)

I had stopped weighing myself for that whole EVIL year, too.  So seeing that 20 pound gain was quite a wakeup call.  I didn't want to obsessively weigh myself or overthink what I've been doing for the last 3 weeks, because it is a healthy way to lose, and I know that.  

BUT yesterday was the 3-week point, so I got on it and guess what?  I FUCKING GAINED 0.8 POUNDS since Jan 1.   I mean, yeah, that's not really gaining, but seriously I didn't lose ANYTHING in THREE WEEKS?!?!

ahzz4g,1548005000,"I don't purge; this is a line I will not cross. I have never purged- no vomiting, no laxatives, I swear to you.

Last weekend I went on a weekend trip and we packed in as much activity as we could. I had the time of my life, biking, sightseeing,  running- good times.  We ate minimally but drank ALOT and I was so bloated the entire trip. It's like my digestive system didn't move at all. I'm suspecting things move pretty slowly down there because I've been restricting. 

On sunday I woke up in the middle of the night so bloated and nauseous I thought I was going to explode.....and then I just couldn't help myself. I vomited until I was empty. 

I didn't want to throw up. If I could have digested it the traditional way I would have preferred that but I couldn't hold it in at all. The reason I was sick and bloated is all because of my shitty eating patterns,  I know this.  But what I am wondering- is this considered purging?   No, this doesn't count.

ah6m7m,1547784818,"My teeth are disgusting (although I brush regularly &amp; always have!). I haven't seen a dentist in almost 20 years.

I purge maybe once or twice a week these days &amp; have suddenly begun to clench my jaw &amp; teeth in my sleep. I've noticed what I assume are abfractions (small tooth fractures where tooth meets gum I believe - meaning my teeth look like they have a dent at the top) in a lot of my teeth both upper &amp; lower...unfortunately mostly in front. I also have one tooth that seems to be turning around! I'm sure there will be a fairly long waiting list so I won't even get seen for a while but I want to at least get the ball rolling.

I assume from what I can see I have a lot of damage (chips, hairline cracks, craze lines) &amp; enamel erosion along with staining where the enamel has worn away. 

Has anyone been to a dentist in the UK on the NHS &amp; just straight up told them you have an eating disorder? I want to be honest so they can help repair or minimise the damage &amp; any future damage but at the same time, I'm in my thirties, I know full well I shouldn't do what I do &amp; it's ridiculous &amp; I don't want to be lectured. 

Recovery was a bust &amp; made me feel worse &amp; anyone trying to push me towards that right now, especially a stranger, is not going to make me very happy. So I thought even before the proper appointment I could sort of give them a heads up. Almost a ""Hello, I'd like to make an appointment but wanted to warn you there may be a lot of damage due to an eating disorder I have &amp; my extortionate consumption of diet fizzy drinks"" sort of thing...so they can be prepared for the mess that is my mouth. 

I hate the idea of the dentist &amp; I know they won't do any cosmetic work on the NHS...but my confidence is zero when it comes to my teeth &amp; if they can maybe save them or at least advise me on better oral care &amp; make them look a *bit* better I might actually smile with my mouth open again. 

Thanks for any advice :) Hope you're all doing well.",-2.510861824654013,EdAnonymousAdults

afg4hh,1547356115,"Hello all,

Me again. I'll put a little TW here for numbers.

I'm sorry to let you all down but nope, I can't do it. Recovery is over.

I had a hospital appointment for an unrelated issue (Crohn's disease) &amp; they weighed me. I know I was wearing clothes &amp; shoes. I know I had eaten lunch before the appointment. I know I was supposed to be gaining. But 40.2kg. 40.2! I was 36kg when I began this eating business. I...got sad. I binged massively a couple of days ago, did not purge, got more sad. I am now back to restricting :( 

I *was* doing pretty well but to be honest, my husband isn't checking I'm eating, doesn't seem bothered in the slightest about all this anymore. Like it was a novelty for him that just fizzled out &amp; now he just trusts me to eat. Well, that trust is misplaced. He never even asks me if I ate/what I ate so I don't even have to lie. He's fine with me having my big salad when we eat together once a day at dinner with our toddler. So, I can get away with it. 

I'm sad to feel/be so deceitful but I have been so uncomfortable this whole time. Stomach pain, horrendous gas, bloating, all that stuff just doesn't make it seem worth it to me. Sure, I had more energy for a bit but even with the increased intake this last week I've felt tired, ratty, bitchy, nasty, anxious.

Now, after seeing that gain on top of all the other stuff I just can't. Maybe once all this bloat &amp; gross feeling goes away I will try again but for now I just want to feel ""normal"" again. I never used to feel so heavy, clumsy, like a confused cow that wandered into a house &amp; started living there. 

So, sorry to have wasted your time on my short lived recovery story :( 

On the plus side they also measured my height at the hospital &amp; I'm taller than I thought! 5""4 instead of 5""3.",-2.852967328482832,EdAnonymousAdults

I love cooking and I’m a good cook, but lately going to the grocery store for more than apples and protein shakes has been to much for me. Hello Fresh listed “low calorie” as an option and I had a coupon to get my first four boxes (of four meals each) for like $20 so I was excited. I picked out my first week’s meals and found a pork chop/potato/green bean meal for 500cal and a chicken fajita for 600. I usually do OMAD and I’m a slut for yummy food so I was happy. Then I went to pick out next week’s food and literally NONE of the options are under 650cal. The only recipes that sounded good were like 750 and 890. HOW is this low calorie?! I spent about 30min pouring over the recipes to see what I could cut out in my portion, cried, and cancelled my subscription. I already paid for the first week so I got those, but I’m so disappointed in myself and in their options. I told my partner it was too expensive to do and that’s why I cancelled, but I feel so shitty. Being an adult isn’t going so well and neither is recovery. ",-1.9320629528133344,EdAnonymousAdults

Well, it's day 5 of the new year. I hope you're all doing as well as you can. Happy 2019!

I totally messed up on NYE. I was doing well but my husband brought home pizza &amp; garlic bread. Ok, I say to myself - a challenge. So, an entire personal pizza &amp; a quarter of the garlic bread go down the hatch. Followed by a bar of chocolate. Followed by some crisps. Followed by cereal. By this point I'm sipping water between bites. You can guess where this is headed. Yep, purged. Sigh. But! I'm now into my 5th day purge free &amp; right back on that recovery horse. I refuse to weigh myself &amp; I still feel out of whack. Bloat, gas, I just feel heavy &amp; rather disgusting. But those are feelings &amp; thoughts. They don't have to translate to any actions. 

So, a slip up on the last day of 2018 but so far 2019 has been all win. It's so hard, but I notice way more energy, much better sleep &amp; I'm no longer a snappy bitch all the time! Baby steps but I'm hopeful :) That old mental calculator still won't stop though &amp; I'm not sure I can ever make it go away.

aa7ufd,1545979007,"Me again! Sorry to keep posting but it's getting a bit rough now.

I know recovery isn't all sunshine &amp; rainbows but something happened &amp; it's so stupid &amp; it really made me want to restrict &amp; I wanted to let it out.

We were going to go to my in-laws for Boxing day lunch the other day. Fine. Normally I wouldn't eat until the lunch but as I'm recovering I thought, nope, I'll have something before because I'm hungry, even though I didn't know what they were making. Stressful enough. Anyway, I had a Cadbury's creme egg. I was proud of that. Not your ""normal"" breakfast choice I guess but considering I don't want to restrict &amp; just eat what I want, that's what I wanted.

So.. I mentioned it to my husband. I don't know what I expected...praise, encouragement maybe? Nope. He got mad! ""So that didn't even last a week."" He says. I asked what he meant. He told me ""I thought you said you were going to eat normally, we talked about this, why didnt you have some porridge or toast or something?"". 

Wtf? So just because I didn't fancy a traditional breakfast food that means I'm eating abnormally &amp; he doesn't count it as a recovery win or anything but eating disorder behaviour? I felt *so shamed* &amp; judged. I was so horribly embarrassed. Guess I won't be having any more fucking creme eggs or telling him if I do. 

I just don't understand...it made me feel so so bad. I'm still doing well &amp; mainly on track but I do feel I've eaten a little less than I should since ""the incident"" subconsciously. I just...I was pretty proud of my ""unhealthy"" choice before a scary, unknown meal &amp; felt it was thrown back in my face.

a9cmrg,1545718451,"Me again! Merry Christmas to all who celebrate! I hope today isn't too stressful &amp; you manage to not only get through it but get some enjoyment out of it too :)

I'm 3 days in to my self-recovery. I've already had a little slip but we won't mention that. I compensated for the compensation...if that makes sense...so I'm still on the right path.

I am cooking Christmas dinner for my little family today. Gammon &amp; various veg. Oddly enough I'm not really looking forward to it as it isn't my preferred food but sometimes, when it's an occasion, food won't be to my preference or taste &amp; I have to learn to suck it up &amp; at least *try* it. I might be pleasantly surprised.

 The cauliflower cheese is going to be a bit of a challenge but I don't have to eat the entire pan or anything so it's not the end of the world. Food is just food. It's there to give my body energy &amp; enjoyment of it is a nice bonus. I also have candy canes on my Christmas tree should I want one. I had a mince pie (that I made myself) yesterday. Still trying to turn off that little calculator in my head though.

So...so far so good pretty much. A little blip, a little cry &amp; soldiering on is how I'm doing really. Physically there is bloating, discomfort &amp; wow do I need the bathroom a lot. But I'm sure eventually it will die down. From my half arsed research this is all to be expected &amp; just pushing through the discomfort &amp; continuing intaking food regularly will help regulate the old digestive system. Fingers crossed. 

Of course I feel guilt, shame &amp; utterly enormous but that's to be expected. I've trained myself over many *many* years to think that way &amp; I have to re train my brain to realise that is not correct. &amp; even if it was...who cares? I'm going to be the only one judging myself so harshly.

Thankyou so much for all the support I received on my last post. It's much appreciated. I might do weekly updates until I either fail totally, win completely, or you guys get bored of me :)

a8inyf,1545460806,"Tl;Dr - Actually committed to recovering for real.

A little update on ""I was doing so well"". I ended up purging again not 2 days after my last post &amp; just...broke. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being exhausted &amp; not present for my husband &amp; daughter. I'm not in life &amp; haven't been for many years. Reaching my ""GW"" has not brought me happiness, it has brought me despair, misery, loneliness, fear &amp; an even lower GW. I hide my body in baggy clothes, I'm not confident, I have no energy or joy. What was the point in having a stick thin body? I wanted it &amp; I have it but I never show it anyway. &amp; who cares? Wow, she can fast for days or restrict for months...big deal. That's not an achievement. She can be a fun mother, she can be a loving wife. Those are the achievements I want. That's the life I want. 

So, after 17 years of hell...I'm doing it. I'm really doing it. I confessed everything to my husband. &amp; I mean *everything*. Total word vomit. I shook, I cried, I felt so embarrassed &amp; ashamed. &amp; I needn't have. I have an incredibly supportive man &amp; I don't know why I doubted he would be anything but kind. 

I am going to recover. I am going to do it with the full support of my husband. I am not going to bother with formal treatment as waiting lists are about a year long here in England anyway (although possibly due to my very low weight I would be seen sooner). But I am determined. This time is for real. 

&amp; I had the damn bowl of cereal this time...&amp; I kept it down. Then I was intimate with my husband after months &amp; years of avoiding that kind of closeness. &amp; I feel...relieved. 

I know it's going to be a long, hard path. I know there may be slip ups. I will be uncomfortable, I will be full, I may even have pain &amp; certainly my body image is shot to shit. But I'll still do it. Because my daughter deserves to have a Mother who cares more about her than a scale number or a clothes size, who can play without getting lightheaded, who has the energy to dance. My husband deserves a wife who doesn't freeze up during a simple hug or push him away every night &amp; shut herself away every evening avoiding all communication.

So, my wonderful ladies &amp; gentleman who were so supportive on my last upset post - I will probably still lurk around these parts but any updates from me will *hopefully* be happy recovery ones or just recovery ones. I hope that's alright with you, if not I understand completely &amp; won't update you. I have no friends so it would be nice to have somewhere to talk so I don't entirely bore the tits off my husband.

Thankyou so much for reading if you got this far. I wish you all the best in whatever journeys you are on &amp; I hope you all find your own peace &amp; happiness. I certainly intend to. I've spent too long in sadness.",-2.5061554924338463,EdAnonymousAdults

Except I’ve gained like 10-15 lbs from an already overweight/obese BMI since leaving treatment (I’m 207lb at 5’6” now and like... it shows). I’m flipping out and to compound it all I’m returning to school in a month and I can’t handle going back heavier than when I left but also I can’t go back with an active eating disorder because that’s why I had to take a 15 month break in the first goddamn place. I can’t waste my time and my parents money but I need to stop being a whale STAT.  my plan is to work out 5-6 days a week, 90 min each, to fast twice a week and to make two homemade meals and one small meal/snack every eating day. no grains, no added sugars but also no hardcore calorie/macro counting bc that makes me more likely to b/p. but I should calculate out the exchanges for each meal so I know I’m in the right range calorie and protein wise (lol treatment is good for something huh...)

a5sq37,1544700822,"I just managed an entire week b/p free. Today *would have been* day 8. Sigh. I kept my daily intake to 800-1000 &amp; was feeling good, in control despite a 3lbs increase from constant awful binges last month. I was pretty much maintaining.

Then I made the mistake. Watching recovery YouTubers. Got myself all inspired. Yes! I'm going to be normal! I'm going to go &amp; have a small bowl of unmeasured cereal. Oh, while I'm in the kitchen I'll just make a sandwich, get some of these crisps...ooh, that chocolate bar is still in the cupboard etc etc. I'm sure you can guess the rest. 

I was trying to give up purging totally. I can't even last 8 days? What?! Ridiculous. I mean, I know I'm frustrated about the 3lbs...but it still only makes me 83lbs at 5""3. That's still fairly ""good"" I guess. 

I go through these recovery wannabe phases, I want to do it for my daughter (she is 3) &amp; it always ends the same. Guilt. Horrible, crushing, never ending guilt. I suppose I'll just stick to ""the plan"", aka what I've been doing for the last 17 years. Get back to 80lbs &amp; maintain. It worked so well before, no significant losses or gains, then the binges began this year. I flip flop now between restriction &amp; b/p &amp; it sucks when I was a straight up restrictor for years with nary a binge in sight.

I'm just so disappointed in myself &amp; wanted to let it out somewhere. I'm freaking 32! I should have more self discipline but I guess I don't know what the hell else I expected trying to go all guns blazing into some pseudo-recovery all by myself with cereal.

a4o86q,1544386139,"It's a rant we've all heard before, but GODDAMN is having to live an adult life with an ED difficult. No matter what your job is, you're gonna need the energy and focus food gives you to be any good at it, but eating like a normal human being means the ED voice is too loud to focus on your job anyway. 
I'm a care worker, and back in September I was restricting very low, only eating when I literally had too. I have 2 clients I had to eat around, so it basically amounted to having a small lunch once or twice a week. As you can imagine, this lead to me being fucking terrible at my job, and I ended up making a few medication errors. I'm really lucky to have not just been fired, but my attempts to restrict slightly higher just ended up in a 2 month binge phase. Still super distracted at work, just for different reasons. Half the time I'd be too busy planning and talking myself down from various self destructive behaviours to pay proper attention to my clients, and I'd raid their kitchens and have to buy replacements before any of my colleagues noticed. And that's not even talking about all the money I wasted buying binge food! I literally burnt through about £2000 in 2 months, just on fucking food. 
And now, when I finally figured out a way to hit my calorie goals and also have enough energy too work, I've got a new main client. She's an ex-social worker and is disabled, not elderly, so she's totally aware of what I'm eating when I'm there. Her specialism was mental health so if I engage in any behaviours around her she catches on straight away. I'm determined to not let this job get ruined by my ED, so I just have to eat normally around her and it's ruining my progress. I'm trapped in this battle between the part of me that wants a life and the part that just wants to lose weight. 
In general, my life is really lonely and boring these days. I work, then I go home, spend 2-3 hours eating 200-600 calories worth of rice cakes and crackers, then go to sleep. Day in day out, that's fucking it. 
I'm sorry I'm not even really sure what I'm saying here I just needed to rant. I wish I could go back to those years as a teenager when I could pretend this was a game I was playing, that it was something I wanted. Adult life just makes this all so much harder. The binges are worse because I have the money to go totally insane on them and I live alone so there's no shame stopping me from ordering food again and again and again as 1 craving after another kicks in. And whilst restricting still brings that sense of control I know it's an illusion. I can literally see my life fall apart in front of my eyes when I'm starving

e5kqib,1575395398,"Hello all. 
I am not a very seasoned redditor, and I am new to this group today so I'm not sure if this is the place for me or not yet. 
I am 28. I have been considered ""recovered"" from my bulimia by most of my friends and family for about 6 years now. What they do not realize is that, just because I managed to pull my face out of the toilet ( most days)  does not mean that still don't struggle with disordered thoughts and body dysmorphia every second of every day. 
At my worst I was purging around 2-5 times a day on average. Sometimes it was a full blown binge, others just after a snack I didn't think I deserved. I had horrible acid reflux, tooth decay, and scars on my knuckles. Now I would say I purge only about once a month, and only in a moment of weakness after overeating. I never intentionally binge and purge anymore. 

That being said, I have lost a lot of the support I once had from those close to me. Not like it's a choice they have made, just that it's not as in their face anymore so they don't think about it as much. While I have come a really long way, and I am very proud of the progress I have made, I still have a long way to go before I can honestly say that I'm comfortable in this body. 

I feel like this part of the recovery doesn't really get talked about. The part when if feels like everyone but you has forgotten that you were on death's door not that long ago. My question is how do you continue to push? What are some things I can do to improve my mental state? 

I have put on some weight in the last few years and I am very uncomfortable with my body right now. It's been so bad lately that I dont even want to be naked to shower, let alone be seen or touched by my husband. I worry that this will hurt my marriage unless I get myself together, because I am constantly turning him down. (What is that doing to HIS self esteem?)

i was asking about advice based on my eating disorder and asking if before trying recovery again i should go ahead and have the binge food i was craving for the last three days. I ended up ordering it and thinking I could let this one roll off my back. Now that I’m waiting for the order I’m getting anxiety and wondering if I just really fucked up.

Basically I restrict and binge eat, both separate eating disorders developed in different points in my life with different triggers. Which is why the “just dont restrict and you won’t binge” method seems to not work.

But I need to get physiotherapy and my mom wants to help me make a meal plan tomorrow because I texted her crying and scared to go to work the next day because I binged and I am at my highest weight in years. Fashion is a creative outlet for me but also a huge trigger there are tons of great pieces I want but am too fat and too broke to do so.

My restriction has lately gotten so much more comfortable and the binges have gotten so much more addictive and I’m a bit afraid of how my food is going to affect me emotionally after I’ve eaten it.

I had food delivered 3 times this week already, the delivery lady knows me by name and said hi to me where I work because she recognized me. I threw away most of one of my 73 dollar order and just ordered almost 50 dollars of food tonight. She doesnt seem to mind at all and I used to work in food service and relate.. we like reoccurring customers who aren’t complete assholes to food service workers who typically order the same things.

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally.

But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

My bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too. Last Thursday I finally went to see a doctor about my concerns who was very reassuring and wrote me a referral for something and she explained the situation to my dad andyesterday I broke down and asked for help even though I've been eating lunch thanks to my bf help and he explained it to my mum...

I've been recovering for the past 2 years or so but  have found the disordered mindset quite difficult to shake off.
Discomfort over my weigh gain and fantasizing about being thin again took up a lot of headspace and I never felt recovered mentally. 

Although not a solution in themselves, I've found that using shrooms has helped me look at my disordered thoughts more objectively and since tripping i've been able to ignore them more easily. I think that they showed me that I didn't need to remain stuck in this mindset and that it was a thought loop that actually could be broken out of.
In some ways, it feels like they've reset my self-image and allowed me to re-evaluate my sense of self-worth and create goals that aren't focused around trying to manipulate my body  in a destructive way. 
I also think that it has helped me process feelings of discomfort more constructively- in the 'afterglow' from my trip i felt amazing in my own skin, and had more positive feelings towards my body than i had ever expected to have. While I was aware that this would fluctuate and would not be permanent, I'm trying to hold on to the idea that good days like these are possible- and actively work towards remembering how these days feel on the not so good days.

I’m still not sure if I trust my eyes. Is it okay, if I just don’t look at myself in mirrors for a little while? It that going to be me buying into the lying narrative that my ED can tell me? I need to eat dinner, but I haven’t been able to bring myself to do that yet. I just am at a loss of what to do. I don’t want to force myself to eat and cause a binge. I also don’t want to restrict and let my ED brain win and start up its old shit again. I’m so frustrated that I am even dealing with this right now. I have grown to be okay with my body in it’s recovered state. Now I don’t know. I am scared.",-0.0421433111856186,EDRecovery_public

I was at my thinnest when i was 15-17 years old, which is around the time I began eating intuitively and skipping meals. I’ve never been one to eat in the morning so skipping breakfast only made sense to me, and antisocial behaviors coupled with staying with my then-boyfriend from 2-9pm every day culminated in me missing dinner most of the time. Once I graduated high school and moved away for college, skipping meals and eating intuitively became more of a money-saving move (in my mind) than a weight-related behavior. I’m 22 now and back home so fortunately there’s no shortage of food to eat, however the years of skipping meals and intuitively eating has shrunk my stomach so much that i can barely eat two full meals a day and i’m always bloated and in pain. I understand that it will take some time for my stomach to go to the size it should be, however I’d really love to start eating like a healthy 22 year old with no concerns about food shortage NOW.

Id love to get back to 106 which is healthy still but more my style and keeps me sane. Idk what to do. All i know is unhealthy ways to lose weight and the cravings are making me feel like I'm crazy.

So, my boyfriend of almost 8 months has been struggling with an ed for a long time now, since before I met him. I met him right around where his disorder was the worst, he easily could have been hospitalized. He was sick beyond belief and passed out regularly, he didn't even know it was an ed he was dealing with till we talked about it and I broke it to him. Now, he's gotten a lot better. He's no longer underweight, he's actually very healthy for his height, and it makes me really proud. But, he still obviously feels very horrible about his body now and has issues with eating. It fluctuates a lot. So far the only people who know about his ed are me and his brother, and we both try our hardest to help him, but it can be very hard, especially for his brother who is easily frustrated. We both simply want the best for him, and worry about him quite a bit, we regularly talk about it and let each other know how he's doing, which he is completely okay with. Basically, I want to know, if you're recovered or recovering, or even if you haven't yet, what would have helped you the most to hear from someone? What are the best ways to offer support for this and help him? I'm fully committed to help him in any way I can, but, I feel like I need a little help from people who may know more than I do.

9grzlc,1537248011,"A little over 2 years ago I was living abroad by myself when I got food poisoning and it pretty much filled my world upside down. Now that I’ve had time to recover and think back on that time frame I’ve come to realize a couple things. 

For one, I was depressed. I didn’t have any friends in the foreign country I was living in, didn’t speak the language and was on the other side of the world from my family and friends. And when I got hit with the food poisoning it was the last push to send me over the edge. 

When I got food poisoning, it was like every other case, but once that was over I had horrible stomach pains every time I ate. After suffering for a week and a half I consulted a doctor online and was told my stomach developed too much acid (from the FP) and that I just had to wait it out (I drank some diluted ACV and was 100% after). But once that was over I started getting awful chest pains and finally succumbed to going to the doctors in person. Once there I was told I just pulled the muscles in my rib cage again (I “did it before” but I recently learned I have a condition called costochondritis).

After that whole fiasco, I was scared to eat. I would have panic attacks at restaurants. Couldn’t stand the smell of food. The thought of eating anything greasy made me nauseous. My stomach was more sensitive than ever. But I slowly recovered. And I’m much better now. There are still a few things I can’t bring myself to eat (eggs, milk, fish) but overall I can say I’ve met a full recovery. 

But when I was suffering from my eating disorder I felt so isolated. Because I wasn’t experiencing a “named” disorder like anorexia or bulimia. So I wanted to share my story for anyone else out there who’s experiencing something similar. You’re not alone. There are some eating disorders out there that don’t have a name but someone other than you is experiencing as well. ",0.0011527762340237,EDRecovery_public

8pl216,1528473495,"There was a post on [r/AskWomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen) about having a healthy relationship with food. Seeing so many people struggling there, I felt compelled to write up what I have learned from seeing a dietician.  I just realized it may be helpful here also!

* Eat at least 15g of protein within an hour of waking up. Whether or not I do this is the biggest indicator of my mood, hunger cues, and eating habits the rest of the day. Please try it. It has changed my life. (amount is based on BMI)
* The plate model for lunch and dinner: 1/2 plate = vegetables, 1/4 plate = carbs, 1/4 plate = lean protein (fish, chicken, beans, nuts, seitan, tempeh, tofu, wheat gluten, etc.)
* Meal planning: plan out your meals for the entire week on one day (gets easier/quicker after a few weeks) and write a shopping list for only what you need. Shop one day a week (max two if you forget somethings) and stick to your list. Helps keep your grocery budget low and eliminates impulse purchases.
* **Your relationship with food and your body is the longest relationship you have. It is an ongoing process. That is okay.**
* Eat a snack in between lunch and dinner that contains a lean protein and a carb. (7\-10g protein)
* Beans = protein and carbs; nuts = protein and fats.
* FAT! You need healthy fats in your diet for important biological processes. (Nuts, fish, avocados, olive oil, dark chocolate, coconut/coconut oil, small servings of cheese, etc.) If you are faced with the option of high fat, low sugar VS low fat, high sugar \- choose the first one.
* Try for consistent meal times each day, including weekends. (roughly the same time \- this one is SO hard)

Eating balanced meals, eating a good amount, and eating consistently throughout the day helps way more than just how your body feels. It helps your mind, your mental health, and mood. I cannot say I have achieved perfection or anything close to it, but these steps have really helped me a lot.

EDIT: Please do not give yourself more food rules because of this post! I wish I had put a trigger warning and now I feel terrible.  These ideas are not right for everyone and not right for every stage of recovery!

I am a 24 y/o woman and currently, my binge eating is much more in control than it has been in past years but I still struggle sometimes (especially with the holidays).  My actual question is in the last paragraph.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it. I feel so out of control and I know it is bad for my health and stunts my weight loss. Sometimes I literally feel ""afraid"" because I can tell that it will be one of those days where I'm ""not in control"" of what I eat. Every so often I'll convince myself that its okay to eat allot, that I don't care if I don't have a fit body or ""extra weight"" that I just want some comfort food.... Conversely, I will literally sit there telling myself ""you're chasing a high, this meal/dessert won't be enough, you'll just want more in an hour or tomorrow"" ""It's fleeting, shallow pleasure"" ""you're addicted and not in control"" ""seeking happiness in a very temporary/ unhealthy way"". Yet I'll go eat garbage or be in the middle of doing so! It SUCKS. Maybe I sound crazy? I'm trying to not get into too much detail. Again, I am much better, I used to eat until my stomach hurt and then keep eating, or eat until it was like 1 in the morning and I was super tired and just wanted to go to bed but I needed just ""one more bite"". It sounds so wild but it's true, food is a drug and sadly, I have an issue. It makes me feel like Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hyde lol, there's the part of me that loves working out and eating healthy and giving people nutritional advice, I feel so great when I eat well and give my body the energy it deserves. But then every few weeks or months this other polar opposite side of me takes over and I feel stuck and out of control and in a worse mental mood (almost like I step into a lesser/different version of myself) and I just eat whatever and it sucks.

So my question is: Is it better to go cold turkey or give yourself a ""cheat meal"" once a week/here and there? When I have cheat meals sometimes it ""triggers"" me to go crazy or one meal turns into two weeks.. But then again, sometimes cold turkey sucks too and then I binge. But I feel like there is a better way to cut off sugar completely than I have done in the past, higher calorie count per day and healthy baked goods and allot of water! Idk. I have gotten much better about not ""punishing"" myself after a binge and eating hardly anything, it's been a real game-changer in stopping binging habits.

ea1cg8,1576225422,"I'm in university and live alone, so I normally have a really good grip on what I'm eating and how much because I can control the quantity of food I have at my place, and I usually buy pretty healthy food (I'm vegan), so even if I would overeat it wouldn't make me feel too bad. 

My parents live about an hour away by train so I do tend to visit them quite regularly and whenever I'm home I just binge. For the whole day/weekend. It's gotten so bad that I dread going to my parents because of the bingeing. My parents usually stock biscuits, savoury snacks etc. so my focus tends to be mainly on that, but I also eat everything else. Mock meat, loaves of bread, blocks of tofu and basically anything I can get my hands on. It makes me feel really bad while I'm doing it and I get physically sick from it, but the first thing I head for when I go home ist always the fridge or the pantry. 

I suspect it's mostly emotional eating since I don't have the best relationship with my parents, but, especially with Christmas break coming up, which means I'm going to be home for two weeks (and bingeing for two weeks does not sound fun), I'm really trying to find a solution for this madness.

e7ptp6,1575782568,"*on not ok

So I’m on medication for anxiety (Effexor) and it makes me hungry ALL THE TIME and I hate it but I feel the medication works so good at helping my anxiety. Like last year my anxiety was the absolute worst it’s ever been because of a health scare and being so anxious I lost like 35 pounds from the anxiety making me nauseous and I couldn’t barely eat as much maybe like a meal a day. Then once I kinda got it under control like 6-7 months later and was put on this medication I started eating more again and eating a lot. It’s so bad! Usually I’ll do okay till mid afternoon and then it really hits me in the evening and before bed when I eat the most all at once. It’s like I’ll eat a sandwich, then a piece or two of cheese, a yogurt and then maybe even a bowl of cereal or a snack cake/dessert literally all within like 45 minutes. 

I feel so bad like this stupid binge eating was the whole problem why I had anxiety because when I was on anxiety medication for the first time up until a few months before my anxiety was bad I gained weight from that too and I guess too much causing pre diabetes and causing me to go into a huge panic thinking that was it and I had diabetes for sure. So I got so anxious I lost weight pretty fast from being too nervous to eat as much any more.  And I’m scared because of this medication it’s gonna cause me to keep binging and then I might actually get diabetes this time if I don’t stop either binging some how or get off of this medication or something soon enough like I did last time when I caught myself before it was too late. 

Does anyone have some tips or something on what to do please I’m so scared I won’t ever be able to lose weight and keep it off.",-0.5809034628584262,bingeeating
e6xl3u,1575631785,"I have been binge eating on and off for the past two years. Last month, I decided to put my foot down and fix my relationship with food before I leave for college. I got the app Recovery Road for eating disorders and have been using to ensure I have a healthy eating pattern (not restricting in daytime, not binging at night) along with tracking how I’m feeling. I will be seeing my therapist again soon to try to get referred to a specialist in eating disorders and get formally diagnosed. I have lowered my binges to around once a week, but the week before Thanksgiving I binged 5 nights in a row (not on Thanksgiving though!). 
I just binged again last night. The whole car ride home from a Christmas party I went I was telling myself all the right things: “Your stomach hurts, you’re full, you don’t need to eat. You can have cookies tomorrow just as much as you can have cookies tonight.” But I gave in, and as always it started with one cookie and turned into seven. 
It’s so hard not to get discouraged and give up, especially when fighting it is so hard. It’s just so easy to say screw it and eat everything I want.

My sleep schedule has been fucked, and I don't know what to do about it, as it seems to be making my binge eating so much worse. I typically wake up between 430-5, and teach until 8 am. At nights (during the week) I very rarely get booked, so I often fall asleep by 5 pm (fatigue makes it hard to ""push"" myself later for the sake of a more regular schedule).  Over the weekends however (Friday &amp; Saturday mostly), it's ""prime time"", and when I make a large chunk of my money/bonuses for the month. So, I often end up sleeping only a few hours. 

Now, I've tried using black out curtains, and I always use a light therapy alarm clock (the winter makes me sad, and this has helped... but not with my sleep). However, I can't find anything that helps me to nap/get more rest! It feels like, once I'm up, I'm up. And if I'm up while also tired? I just can't stop eating!

dv5c7a,1573535657,"I am writing this having just ordered and wolfed down a 50 dollar food delivery. Hawaiian barbeque is my go to. My history with food is long and ardous, just like an abusive relationship. It’s something you just get tired of going through, but your brain tricks itself into thinking that it is something you need to survive. All rationality is flushed down the toilet. It becomes an addiction where having an oreo translates somewhere in my brain to “finish the bag, you already failed”. I am exhausted.
I started this behavior in elementary school. Oddly enough, I wanted to gain weight. I would see larger people and think that they looked cool, tough or whatever. This could have something to do with my father, who would often shame me in parties for not finishing my food. His insult for skinny people was “flatbellies” and often would point them out with me in the car. He is also an alcoholic, intellectually disabled narcissist. Anyways, I made it a goal to reach 110 pounds, just like the husky kid in my class that I admired.  I became infatuated. The fat piled onto my bony frame like it was meant to be there. This continued for about a year until I got to my goal, binging on hot pockets and ramen to get there. After this I realized I had boarded a ride I could not get off. The weight gained and gained. 125, 150, 180. Compounded by the fact that I was in a school full of skinny asian kids who could finish the mile run in 6 flat, and some who also had sociopathic streaks in them. I would always “run the gauntlet” finishing my 11:30 or 12:00 minute, enduring slurs and snickers being thrown behind my back. I preformed similarly in my studies. The teachers always saw me as different, smart but not achieving my full potential. I couldn’t focus, and the diet was getting to me. I became sloppy in class, work slagged behind, I was not learning. My motivation was starting to decline, and the depression started to take hold. I would spend hours and hours in my room, watching youtube videos. Jacksepticeye and Tobuscus became fathers to me, soothing me through the confusion, self hate, and procrastination. The hopelessness grew and grew, becoming a monster I could not face, and had little strength to believe I actually can do so. The binging continued all through the middle school years, and I would sometimes even make oaths for myself that I wouldn’t eat for the day. And sometimes I wouldn’t, but the next would double the urges and the sessions lasted late into the early hours. Some days I would spend all night awake, om the internet. Needless to say, I had been conditioned, by myself or otherwise, to believe I was fat. I could have sunk in three months and probably get back to normal weight. I look back at photos of me then and I see a normal looking, albeit slightly pudgy kid. Not husky or “fat” by any means. 
But things are changing. I often wonder if late adolescence is just reparations for your body and mind. Posture improves, acne clears up, you start to think more seriously about the future, maybe you pick up some hobbies that you actually like. Either way, things change, and life moves on. The human body is very adaptable, I guarantee more so than you give yourself credit for. 
My heaviest was 270 lbs. When I type it up it seems so small, pathetic almost that all the worries came from a number half some people’s body weight. I also compare myself to others, too. But still, I am left thinking “all that, just from 80 extra pounds?!” The weight has recently been shedding off of me since February, 270 to 260 to 248, all the way down to 222 as of today. I don’t know what to say, and I suppose some might want the “secret”. There really is none that I know of, and I guess this fight will never be over. It hasn’t been won, and might not ever, but I don’t ever want to forget my accomplishments. Maybe that is the “secret”. I don’t know, I’m not Oprah Winfrey, you can’t live life bouncing your self worth between a few self help books and motivational videos. I fit into my 8th grade sizes, my tits are considerably smaller, and I have been watching what I eat. Not anally, or into the zone of starvation, but keeping a lunch on me when I go to school, not keeping my card in my wallet, walking around more... etc. And though I am currently hampered by a broken toe, I do not lose hope. I may gain five pounds. I may gain ten, but my mindset is still there. And although I just binged 2000 calories, I know somehow not to let that kill me.",0.0301392768536142,bingeeating

dfl9kb,1570646032,"Hi! Long post ahead, TL;DR at the bottom.

About two years ago, I started a weight loss journey to get healthy and feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm a 5'9'' (&amp; at the time), 23F with a starting weight of 220. After daily exercise, meal planning, and lots of water, I got down to 165 in about 11 months. This was August 2018.

I started graduate school, met a guy, and gained ""happy"" weight. Now I'm 25. I weighed myself today. 190. Ouch. I do not like this at all. I can't fit in my clothes anymore. I just want to be comfortable.

I knew I was gaining weight, and I have yo-yo dieted for about a year. I get SO hungry, and when I cheat... I cheat hard. Binge eating has always been an issue for me. I don't do it for emotional reasons, no. I binge eat because food tastes great. I think about food all the time.

I just can't find the motivation to resume my very restrictive lifestyle from before. I would turn down social invites because I knew that meant alcohol consumption and unneeded calories. I had the willpower to skip dessert and be satisfied with my cooking and meals.

Now, I can't find that willpower anywhere. I don't have the budget to meal plan like I did. And I'm sick of feeling like a sausage in the tightest casing.

I think I need motivation, advice, a kick in the butt from anyone who has experienced the same rollercoaster. My body image isn't great. I think I'm disgusting, but on other people, I think all bodies are beautiful. I want to lose the weight and I want to have a healthier image of myself.

TL;DR: Lost 55 pounds in the span of 11ish months, gained 35 of it back. Can't find the willpower to stick to a healthy eating plan. Looking for advice and motivation.",-0.0926145585620722,bingeeating

d38y1i,1568299563,"I’d hazard a guess and say that 90% of the clients that come to me have suffered from binge eating in some respect over the years, whether that be the reason they come to me, or what’s taken them on a downward spiral.

I say this simply to show you that you are not alone. And whether you’re struggling or have struggled and worried you may revert back to it, here are some of the most effective tips I’ve used to help my clients beat their internal struggles.

Above all though, we’re humans and stuff like this happens. You’re not broken and nothing is ‘wrong with you’. You don’t need to be ‘fixed’, but you can certainly work on the situation going forward to ensure you’re able to beat the struggle and move on confidently, in full control of your emotions and state of mind.
None of the below are bullet proof tactics, they have, as mentioned before, helped my clients beat their current cycle and transform their relationship with food. 

Change your identity.

Understanding the language we identify ourselves with will go along way in determining the level of success we have in changing our habits.

Imagine this.

2 people are outside a bar and get asked if they want a smoke. Both are previous smokers trying to quit.
1 guy replies ‘I’m trying to quit smoking’ whilst the other guy chirps up ‘I don’t smoke’.

Who do you think will stand a better chance in quitting?

The guy who’s trying to change his identity or the one that already has? The difference here is someone still identifies himself as the smoker and the other one now identifies himself as a non smoker.

There’s a saying, ‘We are what we believe. And if we believe we don’t binge, over time we’ll begin to binge less as it’s a habit not associated with ourselves anymore.

Now I don’t mean you have to say things like ‘I don’t binge’ but you could put it in different ways.

‘I respect myself too much to…’
‘I eat well to…’
‘I look after my body because…’

There’s many other ways we can use the language we speak to ourselves to improve our future self but you get the idea.

Pay close attention to the language we use and the way in which we identify ourselves. It’s not a quick fix but the more self aware we become, the greater chance we have in improving our identity around our binge eating habits.

Wait a moment

This one seems relatively easy and it’s often overlooked. It’s no wonder considering it’s deemed too easy to be of any use.

When you’re in that binge eating mode, tell yourself you’re going to wait 20 minutes before taking action. This does a number of things but interestingly it serves as a pattern interrupt. Basically meaning that it distracts you away from the state of mind you’re currently in. Grab yourself a glass of water, drink it and set a timer.

If after 20 minutes you honestly can’t say you’re less interested in binging then go ahead and eat it. Often, when the 20 minutes has passed we’ve moved on, or forgotten that we actually wanted to binge eat in the first place.

Shopping for your foods

Have the foods available in your house? Then when you go shopping, resist the urge to buy the foods. 

This acts as a barrier because when you’re at home and feeling like you want to binge, you can’t. You haven’t brought the foods so it’s another hurdle you have to get over in order to act on your urges. The more hurdles the less likely you are to act.

Most of the time we’re too lazy to go out of our way.
Make sure when you do your food shopping you’re:

Not absolutely ravenous
Hit the veg aisles first and fill up
Use a smaller trolley

Not fuming after an argumentA few of these are tongue in cheek but meant well. If you’re hungry, you’re more than likely to choose foods that will satisfy your current cravings and feeling.

And finally, shop online if you feel you can’t trust yourself just yet. It’s the way I do my shopping and many of my clients do, and without looking at the stats, the chances of picking healthier options in your Tesco shopping goes up.

I don’t think I’ve ever put a caramel bar or marshmallows in to it…and I LOVE a caramel bar…

Take control back
 
Ok, perhaps it’s common knowledge that right now your relationship with your trigger food isn’t great, perhaps you’ve been defeated many times previously.
But, by following the steps below, we can begin to change our relationship with that said food.

First, remove it completely. Take all temptation out of the equation. Break the cycle.

If you can’t stop bingeing on Doritos and Dairy Milk then don’t buy those foods and eliminate it completely from your diet.

From that, follow through for around 21-30 days before you slowly introduce those foods into a situation in which you can control.

Can’t get enough of ice cream? Then perhaps when out for a walk grab an 99er from the Ice Cream van half way along your journey.

You can’t devour seven of them and you’ll only have the ability to eat one along the way. You can’t splurge out as there isn’t any other Ice cream around so you stop at one.

Therefore you’ve won the very first time you’ve reintroduced the food.

Can’t handle a drink without adding more to your evening?

Drive your car and bring small change like a £10. Along with that go out with a friend that isn’t a heavy drinker, or a drinker at all so you’re in a situation you can win.

They may be small wins but they change your attitude to the whole situation.

Once you do this a couple of times, your confidence will increase and so will your ability to control your surroundings.

Get more confident over the next 21-40 days before you slowly take back the handles and give yourself a little more responsibility. If you feel yourself starting to go back to ‘binge eating mode’ slow down and pull the reins in a little until you’re more comfortable.

Don’t be so restrictive

If someone sits you down, with a big red button in front of you and repeatedly says ‘Don’t push the button’ no doubt you’ll have some serious reservations about pushing that damn button. It’s sooo tempting.

I remember watching Derren Brown sit participants down in one of his mindset shows and said DO NOT WHATEVER YOU DO PUSH THIS BIG RED BUTTON OTHERWISE THIS INNOCENT KITTEN HERE WILL DIE.

Now for something so vile &amp; inhuman, it would be easy to sit there for 20 mins and not push the button, or so you’d think.

In fact, within 60 mins over 80% of participants pushed the button and actively killed the sweet little kitten they’d seen wondering around in the box opposite them (nb: he didn’t kill the kittens).

Whilst we’re not killing any kittens when dieting, we do have those exact same urges to restriction.

You tell yourself under no circumstances can you eat your ‘trigger foods’ and before you know it you’re covered in ice cream, head to toe with it sprawled around your mouth, overflowing on to your hoodie. 

Beyond that, once you’ve broken the ‘resistance’ then what’s the point in stopping?

You’ve broken it anyway, so you might as well carry on, right?

I get it, if you’re doing this time and time again it’s not your fault, it’s because we’ve been told for years that in order to lose the weight you have to eat clean, wholesome foods all of the time and those little bits of enjoyment you had in your diet before have no place in your diet when it comes to a flat stomach.

However, I’ve found time &amp; time again that by including the foods you love, you find it a whole lot more enjoyable when sticking to a certain plan. And knowing you’ve afforded yourself a scoop or two of ice cream, or two Maryland cookies into your diet means you’re a lot more relaxed about the whole thing.

No longer is the food in control of you.

I’d rather you be flexible in your approach, eat wholesome foods 80% of the time and stick to the process 80% of the time then aim for 100% compliancy and fall short.

If you constantly try to cut these foods out, You’ll end up kicking yourself over and over and drag your heels around as to why you keep tripping up. Isn’t it best to try something new?

Identify your triggers

We can also learn to be more self aware. If we better understand what’s causing our binge eating we can better understand how to prevent and control the triggers that lead to it.

Keep a diary and a log book of the foods you’ve eaten during the day, how they’ve made you feel as well as your sleep quality and your stress levels.

There will more often than not be a correlation between one symptom and a trigger. It might perhaps have been a stressful day in meetings which has led you feeling exhausted and craving some energy and comfort when you’re home. This energy and comfort comes in the form of a glass of wine and a large chocolate bar and a bag of crisps.

If you begin to realise that after meetings you get cravings, then you can begin to plan against the likelihood of bingeing when back. You could remove the foods completely or when driving back go a different way home from normal so you’re not picking up the foods driving home.

Once you’ve understood your triggers, you can then change your cues (or actions that are a result of the triggers).

And finally, if you are able to understand that stress is the trigger, and the reward from binge eating is to reduce your stress and calm down, is there another way you can change the cue but get the same reward?

De stressing could be from making a phone call to your best mate, telling your loved one that you love them, or meditating.

There’s a number of ways in which we can alter the reward to still suit our needs without the need for bingeing and becoming more self aware around your diet and lifestyle will go a long way in helping you put together a plan of action to change the outcome.
Again, the above are all ideas and helpful ideas that have been successful for my clients but for sure, as obvious as it sounds, we’re all different.

What may work for someone may not work for other people.

To finish, if your binge eating is a habit you really feel you can’t break, or is getting you anxious and bringing other mental issues then I’d advise to go and see a specialist who can really help you on a deeper, personal level.

Wherever you are on your journey, just remember that by giving up, you will not be able to move beyond it so just keep going.

I believe in you.

Hugs and kisses

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't even register that i had the disorder until it was suggested by my counselor at the time \[who i was seeing in regards to an ever deepening depressive episode and a full on anxiety attack in the middle of work - no i dont work there anymore\] I had always just assumed i was lazy/ greedy/ not trying hard enough. I was pushing myself so hard. I wanted so badly to have enough willpower that i weighed out and calculated all my calories for the WEEK each Sunday for a full year. I spent three hours a week in the gym and what little time i had where i wasnt in work i slept. I was so strict with myself that when my weight stalled I would take laxatives because I had to see a drop in the scale...

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually gave in and just overate until i piled back on the 50lbs it took me the year to loose.

&amp;#x200B;

After this breakdown, \[last august\] i decided to just focus on my health. New year new me! And in January i decided to go back to a keto diet. I weighed my food. I calculated calories and i was religious about it. I lost 40lbs over 3 months but i was pushing myself so hard to the OTHER end of the ED spectrum. I was happy if i ate on average 1000cals or less a day. I would fast for as long as i could before eating and then when eating i didnt even wnt it. I would be full off a chicken breast and half a head of broccolli... \[which might sounds great\] but eventually it caught up to me. I was thinking about nothing but food. I would get mad if someone ate something around me that I couldnt have. Just walking down the bread isle with my partner in the supermarket would make me so angry and i would want to squish the bread...

Eventually i started sneaking ""off diet"" foods... then i decided to just have a break and i havent gone back since... obviously ive gained that weight back again.

&amp;#x200B;

Im hoping that by addressing the root causes of WHY i overeat i might be able to get a grip on my relationship with food and put this to rest. Im sick of being fat. Ive felt overweight my whole life despite the fact that it wasnt until i was 18 that i was actually overweight \[between starving myself for days on end and then eating a families worth of a meal at once, drinking and eventually just having had so much of it all i tried to end myself\]

&amp;#x200B;

cnyps6,1565333874,"Hi,

I found this community because I wanted to post to avert myself from binge eating.  I'm in a high trigger moment.   I got some upsetting news earlier today.

I'm upset and I don't know what to do about it.  I am not sure what I'm ""supposed"" to do.  I've been kind of dancing around it all evening, finding great ways to distract myself...  watched a bit of tv, but had to turn it off.  Ate a dispersed dinner.

I can feel the binge eat urge lurking behind my eyes right now.  It's the feeling of wanting to just consume.  I don't even need to enjoy the food for me to enjoy bingeing it.  

I live by myself and I am just thinking about how I need to make changes in my life.  Having to change scares me a bit, if I'm to be honest. (This has to do with the upsetting news)  I am hoping I am still ""myself"" when I come out on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, I would get into my car, go to a drive through, get food, so much food - milkshakes, burgers, chicken rings, jalapeno sliders, fries, all of the food that is so disgusting and bad for you.  The type whose smell clings to everything, even my pee a day later.

In some ways I am too indulgent, I'll coddle myself to weakness, fatness and laziness.  Binge eating is a part of that.  Giving myself the OK to eat when I know I shouldn't, when I'm not hungry, when I don't need it.  I think I eat it to prove a point that I can.  At least I have that security in my life.  Doesn't make much sense, when I type it all out and try to read it back to myself.  It just sounds childish and sad.

Its the feeling of searching for something and my mind converted it to the lowest level.  

&amp;#x200B;

That's all for now, it's 1:54 am where I live and even though I knew I shouldn't, I checked UberEats.  The only food was endless listings of McDonald's, Rally's, White Castle, over and over.

cj5dd7,1564368897,"I recommend Amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman. I was particularly intrigued by Postman's observation that people generally imitate, in speech and behavior, the culture's prevalent communication mediums. For example, in the 1800s when everybody was reading for entertainment, they'd imitate, in everyday speech, the way their favorite authors spoke in print, because they loved him for his skill and power of thought. If that very author were to pass them in the street that day, nobody would recognize him unless he introduced himself. So it wouldn't matter to them if he was ugly or fat or thin. But with the invention of the camera, and the ensuing popularity of movies and television and video, the visual image - faster and easier to process by the human brain, requiring less energy to digest than written ideas -  became integral in communication media, to the point that today, a person's image (on tv or in movies) is more important to the masses than the substance of their message (unconsciously of course). So even intelligent people start wondering why they care so much about the way they look in the mirror, start obsessing over it, maybe even blame themselves, thinking themselves vain and maybe not as intelligent as they perhaps assumed, without realizing it's not them to blame, but rather that the masses have been conditioned to pay more attention to a person's image than to his/her character, or to what they may have to say.

The book's main thesis is that our culture is addicted to entertainment. Maybe another reason binge eating is on the rise is because we're constantly encouraged to seek stimulation, and many of us get hooked to foods that are specially formulated to give us that buzz. Juxtapose the importance of image to the addiction to entertaining foods, and you begin to see why many of us are trapped the way we are. Very enlightening read.

From childhood, I was always a very active child and very fit due to the fact that I was always in sports. Food has always been an escape for me but I was able to control everything due to the amount of activity I was doing, my age, and the fact that I was so busy. About six years ago, everything changed. I suffered from a huge injury which forced me to stop all physical activity and sent me into a huge spiral. I became incredibly reclusive and most days it felt like my family and close friends were complete strangers. During this time, my only joy came from food and over a two year period, I gained almost 100lbs. Honestly, I am not sure what sparked me to change but since then I have started to lose the weight but iI still fluctuate severely and no matter how hard I try, I continue to slip and go into horrible binges. At this point, I binge twice or three times a week and they are usually back-to-back. How can I escape this or at least start making my binges less frequent?

The past few weeks have been rough, but recently it is starting to turn around. Today, for whatever reason, I decided to have one lindt truffle.

I even logged everything, including the candy, and I'm only 200 calories over, and it's still under my maintenance.

Even better, when you’re hydrated, your body will reward you: most adults, when properly hydrated, have been shown to have a lessened appetite, drastically reduced cravings, and a smaller waistline.

**A few other ways to battle your carb cravings:**

* **Chew gum.** Oral fixation? Maybe. It’s been said that chewing gum can help curb carb cravings for many people. Give it a shot - can’t hurt.
* **More Protein.** Some studies show that eating higher levels of protein with breakfast reduced cravings significantly. Lots of people are going [keto](https://hvmn.com/blog/keto-diet/keto-and-intermittent-fasting-a-beginners-guide) these days — zero carbs are extreme, but adding protein in its place doesn’t generally hurt.

I have been binging for probably about 2 years now.

Some quick background about me; I have been struggling with binge eating for most of my life, however, I (25M) only just realized how much of an issue it is within the last 5 years. I suppose before I thought it was “normal” to be able to mindlessly eat a whole box of cookies and keep looking for more. One of the best (and worst?) parts of my issue is that I have a masters degree in clinical nutrition, so I am acutely aware of what I’m doing to my body. Anywho, I’m a rather big research person; if someone makes a claim I’ll be that jerk who tells them “cite your source.” That being said I’ve been searching for research on hypnosis and its efficacy on helping those struggling with binge eating, because I was considering it before turning to more expensive therapies and such, but I can’t seem to find anything even remotely sound on the topic. So, I’m wondering if anyone here knows of any research or has had personal experience with it? If so, would it be okay if I questioned you about your experiences?

My eating habits have improved immensely since a decade ago, when I was unknowingly *deep* in BED. Now, it's much less obvious/frequent, but I still have many unhealthy eating habits with the occasional light binge, and I hope I can get some help to break them. 

My theory is that since you have to wear the aligners for 22 hours of the day, and you can't eat with them (because you can crack an aligner and mess up you progress) that will pretty sufficiently end snacking. Also, many people find their mouths to be sore, and they don't enjoy eating so much.

c15a5d,1560652966,"I literally feel myself losing control over my own body. I feel like ever since the summer began I've just been eating to no end. It's already started to feel as if all my days have blurred into one repetitive blob of daily routine. 

I hardly leave the house or make plans with anyone, I always say next week or something because the day has already started lol why go out right? And then I'll just do the same thing I do everyday which is usually the same thing, play video games, watch something, and always: eat. 

I can't stop eating and I've noticed as of late I've been eating to the point of sickness. Today my siblings brought home some sandwiches from some place they went to, and mine was literally so tasty. I could feel myself getting terribly full, but I couldn't stop. I eventually did because I was like ""I'll end up v ill if I don't stop right now"", which I'm thankful for because I currently feel like there's just a rock in my stomach. And at least I'll have the rest for later? 

I don't know where this even came from because honestly I was never this bad with food. If anything I'd only ever eat small snacks throughout the day and hardly any real food, or even then might not eat much of that either. 

I feel like ever since the summer began and ever since my sister I havent seen since I was a kid has come to live with us, I was hit with this wave of just complete and utter dysphoria, about my looks/weight. Up until this point I feel as if I haven't experienced that type of thing since like highschool. I've actually been growing ro love myself.

Eating moderately is frustrating and farting (sorry!) irritating, but binging is very painful in my stomach and feel very disgusted. AHHHH! At times, I just feel like screaming out of this dilemma.


Also, not binging is scary. I feel I am not being myself. Phasing out the binging habit is like losing a huge part of my identity. I feel shook and rattled. I don't wanna lose 'me'; I care for my binging part. She's just an innocent girl who just wants to have fun, avoiding pains.

And then I'm off to the races!

I go to the store. I pick out all the food that the anticipatory dopamine signalling in my brain is pulling me to. I am in a complete, neurochemical stupor from the second the decision is made. Any delays between the decision and the outcome causes angst. ""Hurry up, I need to pay"", ""get out of my way, I need to get home so I can eat this"". I mean, really. My life's mission and objective at this point in time is simply eating.

I will also notice that my ability to reason during these periods is actively suppressed. If you stopped me and asked me a simple but intellectual question at one of these points in time, I would no doubt come across as dull; higher levels of brain relegated, leaving only my primitive parts to manifest. I don't think it is coincidental that my sex drive is high after one of these binges; these binges are not just about food, they're about the raw expression of impulse without reservation or any sign of self-restraint.

I have always struggled with this, and I am male; now 25. I know that eating healthy food and having fitness goals helps. Especially cutting out carbs; if done consistently (without any cheats), my cravings drop to nothing when carbs are excluded.

However, all it takes to engender a ""cheat day"" is one bad night of sleep, and I'll wake up the next day with an urge to eat bad food. And all it takes is one day to set this train in motion.

I don't know what the solution is. Mental resilience is not the answer; *it is* the solution, but not a good answer. If we were resilient, we wouldn't be battling with this. However, I think one answer is meditation. Scheduled meditation, especially before those times of day you usually binge, would seem to me to be a good, preventative counter-measure.

Do you usually binge at 6.30 p.m.? Try to squeeze in 15 minutes of breathing-focused meditation before then. It's unlikely that you will awake from a meditation with a rampant binge-eat. Then, *when you do eat*, eat healthful food with plenty of fiber so that you are full. Salad seems great for this; a high-volume food that can reliably encourage satiation, if combined with other healthy food like salmon.",0.0058478907244573,bingeeating

bvsysp,1559444178,"Today would have been Day 3 but I lost my footing tonight. Here's a timeline with what I ate: 

\- Made myself a big salad for meal #4 (I like to eat 5 smaller, healthy meals a day). This is when the urges began. 

\- Tried to distract myself by taking dog for a walk. Walked for 35 minutes. Success!

\-Came back and decided to make myself a protein crunch wrap (it's basically flavored protein powder mixed with water, wrapped in a tortilla and popped into the oven to make a crunchy wrap). I'm a bodybuilder so I have all these protein food recipes I love. The wrap is only 270 calories, delicious and fits my macros so I don't feel to bad about it. 

\- Then I think to myself....ah, I really want something else. That wrap was only 270 calories. I have room for more (I don't). I make myself a vegan mug cake with greek yogurt frosting, strawberries and walden farms syrup.

\- I'm definitely full after the mug cake. But I really want another mug cake. So I make one more with greek yogurt frosting and diced strawberries and syrup.

\-After the second mug cake I'm stuffed. I force myself to go sit down and try and focus on a project I'm working on. But I want more food. I like eating while I'm working on projects. I get about three minutes into my project when I stand back up and walk into the kitchen, almost like in auto-pilot mode. 

\-I eat a few cashews from the jar. A bunch of pumpkin puree mixed wth pb2. I go sit back down.

\-About ten minutes goes by and I'm feigning. I tell myself it's the last weekend I'll have the house to myself (fiance is out of town), plus I'm on my period (TMI? Oh well, time to grow up), so I deserve a get-out-of-jail-free card for tonight. Then I think about how shitty I'll feel in the morning. Then I remind myself it's the last weekend I'm home alone. I get back up.

\-I eat one of those jumbo flour tortillas - 310 calories each. I eat it slow, piece by piece, mesmerized by its texture. That shit is so fucking bomb. At this point I contemplate driving to the store to buy a box a cereal to binge on. No, don't do it, I tell myself. You'll REALLY feel like shit in the morning if you do that. Then I think about ho ho's and a bavarian cream filled donut. And the really really bottom of the barrel junk food. 

\-I make a compromise with myself: instead of cereal or donuts, I decide on two massive bowls of oatmeal mixed with PB2, almond milk, and bananas. I think to myself....I'll wake up feeling kind of crappy, which is better than REALLY REALLY DEPRESSED and shitty from eating  bottom of the barrel junk food.

&amp;#x200B;

I think my binge is over. It could have definitely been a lot worse, and I think if I can stay stopped then I won't wake up feeling like hell like all last week when I ate donuts and cupcakes and cake and little debbie treats.

I do however face times where I can't control myself and I knowingly binge, I will eat 2/3 family sharing meals in one sitting, followed by 2 or 3 tubs of ice cream and a tonne of chocolate.

bv87on,1559313021,"A few years ago, I woke up feeling extra shitty - **defeated, hopeless, sick to my stomach** \- from a particularly horrible evening of drinking. **I felt so out of control** with alcohol and my life.

Every morning I woke up terrified that I would drink, and every night I would drink, and drink way too much (because once I broke the seal, **I got the fuck its, numbed out, and went full hog**). **I was so sick of promising myself I would quit** drinking, only to break my promise and fail myself - over and over and over. I didn't believe myself at all, and my promises felt emptier and emptier with each passing day, which terrified me more and more because -- **if you can't trust the one and only mind and body you inhabit, then what CAN you trust? It's a scary place to be.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was so sick of myself. I hated myself. And it's hard to feel motivated to change and improve for someone you don't respect.

&amp;#x200B;

As I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I wondered how the hell I got to that point. I reflected back on my life, and thought back to when I was just a little girl. I saw myself at about 7 years old, running around the park, playing in the sand, just being a kid with her entire life ahead of her. So much hope, so much to live for. What did she want in life? What were her hopes and dreams? Tears started streaming down my face, because even though I hated the person I was in that moment, I realized I still loved that little girl, and I still wanted to make her hopes and dreams come true. I couldn't do it for myself, but I could do it for her.

&amp;#x200B;

And right then and there, I sat up in bed, sobbing, and decided......**I'm going to do this. I'm going to do it for her.**

&amp;#x200B;

And I linked both my pinkies together, because that's what kids do...right? And I pinky promised myself that I would never, ever give up, that I would **keep trying something new, something different,** until I finally found something clicked.

&amp;#x200B;

And for the first time in months, after all the empty promises, after losing faith in my own word, I actually believed myself. I realized....  maybe I can't promise myself that I'll stop drinking today, because that still feels so out of my control, but I can promise myself that **I will keep trying new things.** That I will not give up. Even if I fall back down, the promise can still hold true, because **it's not contingent on my success/failure,** only on my effort.

&amp;#x200B;

When I made that promise to myself, I meant it.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I stop drinking that day? No. But **I started making real progress, started putting together new puzzle pieces, and I started having real faith that I was going to find something that stuck.**

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am almost two years sober.

&amp;#x200B;

Why am I writing about this?

&amp;#x200B;

Because I'm struggling with binge-eating now. And it's been painful. All those emotions I struggled with while I trying to quit drinking, the cycle, the relapses, the waking up hopeless and defeated, it's all back, only now it's with food.

&amp;#x200B;

But this time, I KNOW for CERTAIN that I will find something that clicks for me, that I will overcome this. Because I did it with alcohol. And I can do it with food. And so can you.

&amp;#x200B;

**The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. This is why we have to keep trying new things, because what works for one person won't work for the next.** We are all individuals with unique stories and motivations and backgrounds, so that is why we have to keep trudging forward, paying attention to every setback so we can learn for the next round.

&amp;#x200B;

**So let's make a pact,** guys. Let's freaking do this. Maybe we'll binge again, maybe we won't. But what we CAN be certain of is that we'll get back up. We'll FACE what happened, so we can learn from it. We'll try something different, so we can figuring out new tools and strategies.

&amp;#x200B;

**We're in this TOGETHER!**

&amp;#x200B;

And every time we try something new, let's share it on here so we can keep helping each other out, and motivating each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Who's in? Pinky promise?

&amp;#x200B;

Here are a few new things I have been trying:

1. I have been listening to a new podcast that has been really comforting. It's called ""Healing Emotional Eating"" by Janet D Thomas. Even though it's about emotional eating, it totally applies to binge-eating.
2. I have been trying shift my focus from what I want, rather than on what I don't want. So instead of being like.."" I don't want to binge, I don't want to eat that, I don't want to do this, or that."" I am thinking ""I want to eat bomb, healthy foods that make me feel amazeballs, I'm a badass who is free from the chains of food, I want to wake up without bloat belly tomorrow, I want to go to bed feeling good."" I feel like focusing on what I don't want still gives it power and energy. I want to shift that energy and power to the things I want so I feel motivated to chase them. It also helps squash that ""voice"" that tells me to binge.
3. Meditation. I have found some food freedom meditations on YouTube, and am trying them out in the mornings. I used to think meditation was so hokey, but I got so desperate when I was trying to quit drinking that I tried it - mainly because my brain felt so effed up I knew I needed some mental clarity. Well goddamn,....that shit actually helped A LOT!!!
4. When I want to eat something when I'm not hungry, I play the video reel all the way through to the end. I think to myself....ok, so you eat the donut. Where are you going to be in five minutes? Exactly where you are right now, because it's not like the donut is going to be in your mouth forever (though that would be nice, wouldn't it, lol. Note to self: invent the eternal donut). You're going to be right back at square one, with no donut in your mouth, just like right now.

bklcmp,1556977977,"In Oct last year, I realized that I needed to lose weight. Sat down, I didn't eat, I did nothing special and something clicked.

I had always been too big and most people around me, including my family, neighbours and class mates, never failed to let me know. In very early memories, I remember sneaking into the kitchen, trying to stuff my face with leftovers. 

Sometimes, I'm binging. Most of the times, I'm overeating uncontrollably. I don't like sweet things, I can perfectly control that, but I crave fatty/salty and heavily processed food so much. I've got literally no self-esteem and I felt so low through all my life and so ashamed of myself. 

I had been making efforts to lose weight before, it really started in early 2017. However, last year, I committed. I started walking __a lot more__, restricted my calories and I lost ~44 lbs. Then, in January, I had a really, really hard time in my relationship. ""Rewards"" aka food turned into massive triggers. But deep down, I knew I wouldn't stop to make an effort to have the body I want. There was no turning back. I put on 17 lbs, however. 

I am currently at 180 lbs. I relapsed yesterday, but I managed to put the leftovers of my bf aside today and make healthier choices - as I did the rest of the week! I still feel like I am just at the beginning of building a healthy relationship with food. But I'm proud of myself and it's helpful know that I will continue to make progress.

Here are some tips which are hopefully helpful:

*Track everything. Even your bad days. I ate 3500 calories yesterday, but it makes me feel in control to know that. It helps to keep track of what you eat.

*Move on from yesterday. It doesn't help to shame yourself for what happened in the past. Focus on making healthier choices today.

*__Don't treat yourself with food.__ It's just my personal view, but I found that this is just a trigger for me to fall back into addiction and it doesn't help me to built a healthy relationship with food. I don't want it to be my comfort or reward, although enjoying it.

*Notice the conditions before you're binging. What time is it? How do you feel? What's in your mind? What are you eating? Who's with you? Maybe you can identify regularities, change it up and eliminate triggers. It's hard, I'm working on it as well.

*Be prepared. Don't keep unhealthy snacks in your apartment. Don't tempt yourself.

*Seek professional help. Or seek support otherwise. I find it incredibly reassuring to exchange thoughts, advice and experiences with those who go through similar things.

*Find an inspiration. Mine is r/gonewild, I prefer it because there are real people without all the filters the advertisement industries put over a woman's body. It could be as well depressing to see all those perfect bodies, so just be aware of what works for you. Be creative. Write it down, hide little notes for yourself. 

*Find hobbies. Meet friends. Avoid drugs.

These are my tips - feel free to add what you'd consider helpful. At the end of the day - don't hate on yourself for making mistakes. Sometimes, we fuck up. Sometimes, we do it for a very long time. I constantly binged for 2.5 months straight. It was rough. But if you are ready, you are ready. I'm eating healthy again. You are doing your best and that's enough.

bj3y7p,1556634496,"So let me just preface this by saying I don't exactly know what is wrong with me, but I seem to have eating habits par dysfunctional.

It started about a year ago when my best friend committed suicide. I started foregoing meals every so often, until my stomach would cringe and curl and digest itself. I came to like something about that pain in my gut that reminded me of Kyle. A familiar guilty pleasure I had experienced with my relapse the same time. Very quickly my lack of eating turned into not eating at all for days at a time sometimes I would be so fatigued from lack of energy and no sustenance that I would collapse on the floor drained of energy and white as a ghost. I'm not sure how or why it happened, but eating turned into a coping mechanism for me. The pain that my body felt accurately reflected what I was going through emotionally. I have been struggling with this problem for over a year now, and what I have noticed is, my eating habits have been permanently changed. Now, the only way my body can even accept food, is by binge eating for sometimes three days in a row, gorging myself until I'm sick. and then my appetite goes away for another week sometimes two or three weeks. I have never talked about this before, or even really looked at it as a disorder, but since the suicide I have lost a noticeable amount of weight, my behavior has changed, my routines have changed, my healthy lifestyle has gone to s***. I have lost ton of weight, I get sick when I do eat, and i get sick when I dont eat. I have no energy anymore except apparently when I'm trying to sleep... my anxiety is always on full alert putting me in a Perpetual state of shakey paranoia.

bi0x84,1556383326,"I find that when my thoughts are constantly shifting they tend to eventually land on images of food which my body becomes excited over, and if I don't slow my thoughts down and recognize where the food images will lead to, I automatically walk over to the food and put it in my mouth. However, having completely focused attention seems to prevent, or at the very least, delay the food images, and gives my rational mind more time to understand what is happening. Instead of surfing the internet at night, which is when I overeat, I focus on drawing a really nice illustration, with bebop jazz in the background, and this has helped keep the food thoughts away tremendously. It has helped me to 'catch' the images in my head and to realize that if my body responds to them in any physical way (i.e using my legs to stand, to walk over to the fridge, using my hands to open the cupboards etc) I will continue the cycle of suffering for just so much longer.

b1zu29,1552785493,"Hey guys, new to reddit, but unfortunately long time experiencer of BED. I’m a 29 y/o female, 5’8”, 150 lbs. I have been a binge eater on and off for about 10 years. I never took it seriously when I was younger because I had a very high metabolism and played sports, which kept my weight pretty stable despite my eating habits. I realize that I am still within a ‘normal’ BMI range, but I definitely don’t feel ‘normal.’ All of my close friends are in relationships and I feel lonely a lot of times. I also don’t have any interest in going out and socializing because I don’t feel great about my body right now and my clothes fit tighter than normal which makes me uncomfortable. A lot of nights I look forward to going home from work so I can be alone and eat foods that are significantly high in fat and sugar. And even though I know beforehand I will feel ashamed and guilty about doing so, I do it anyway. I know that restricting a significant amount of calories and/or certain food groups triggers binges, but I also find that when I try the intuitive eating approach I just consume an insane amount of refined sugary foods. Now as I’ve gotten older it’s more difficult to lose the weight from yo-yo dieting and it has impacted my mood and self-esteem more than ever. I also have mild depression which I started taking Wellbutrin for a few years ago. It worked really well initially, I lost ten pounds and felt absolutely wonderful. Since then the effects have worn off and the only change I really notice from it is a decrease in fatigue. I exercise regularly and it definitely helps to stabilize my mood and eating habits, but I’ve been in a slump lately..like the last few months for sure and each time it seems harder to crawl out of it. The only time I have sought professional help was about a month ago. I signed up for online counseling through BetterHelp to try and get to the root of my depression, but I couldn’t find a counselor who specializes in disordered eating so I didn’t find it to be effective. Unfortunately traditional therapy isn’t affordable for me at this time. I just feel so gross right now and am fearful the weight gain and depression is only going to get worse. Summer is approaching and that is when I typically spend the most time being social with my friends. If I feel how I do now I know that I won’t want to leave my apartment. This has happened in summers past and I regret feeling as if I ‘wasted’ my youth on my food addiction. I also find myself feeling guilty of having these thoughts because all in all I have a pretty great life. After having traveled to third world countries I know there is someone who would be extremely happy and appreciative to have my life, yet I can’t seem to fully enjoy it. I guess I’m just wondering where I go from here? Are there any recommended workbooks? Online counseling available that has been effective for others? Are there reddit users for hire?

al25zl,1548781964,"So, my girlfriend struggles with BED for quite a long time. She's been very depressed and she wanted us to break up. I didn't let her do it. We started seeing a psychologist, tried many techniques (CBT, IPT..) and it really helped her a lot. Not at first but eventually, when she accepted the treatments and started fighting. She got knowledge and awareness about her disorder. Also, her condition was mixed, food addiction and BED. Besides compulsive eating and bingeing, she also couldn't stop with certain types of food.

After she got better, she wanted to write a book about her condition(s), but more oriented on her tips how she overcame her disorders (she still struggles from time to time but compared to the previous, she lives much more healthy and happier life). Then I came to the idea (as I work in the IT industry) to make some kind of educative mobile app that will help others struggling with food addiction and BED.

We asked students of psychology and their professors to help us on this project to fill the educative content, in form of 90 educative videos that will lead a person through a 3-month therapy.

There is also a community section, like here on Reddit and some other features like statistics, motivation and helping others in need.

Honestly, you can call my post marketing, the app is new on the Google store, we published it just a week ago. I never used Reddit as a marketing tool, so besides naked marketing, this is also an invite to try something different (I hope it is). Maybe those educational videos will help you, maybe the community will. Or maybe it is a waste of time. We don't know so at least we would appreciate to give us a feedback :)

Growing up with a binge eating disorder....

&amp;#x200B;

  
 

https://i.redd.it/v0kmm3ir7g821.png

This is not an easy post for me to put out there but I will try my best. I even wondered if I SHOULD post it – but if it can help someone out there than all the better.

&amp;#x200B;

 I believe my binge eating started slowly in childhood (hiding junk food, eating it all at once sort of thing when noone was around or after being told NO you can't eat this - provoked me to eat it and then some) and progressed heavily into my teen years and came to an impass – very high disordered level into my mid 20s. I think it stemmed from feeling not good enough in my body, feeling like I was too chubby, unpretty. All of these crazy emotions, stress, worries and thoughts going through my head that I could not control any other way than to eat them on bite at a time.  Believe it or not being in competitive dance will do that to you if you are not careful or surrounded by the right people! I was often weighed weekly with my weight being subject of critical conversation, put on crazy diets (sugar free, fat free, low calorie etc etc) in order to achieve a desired outcome and at such a young impressionable age.  The stress of dieting on such a young body also lead to autoimmune. 

&amp;#x200B;

 All of that lead me to hiding cookies and brownies and doritos and eating it in hiding – I literally got a high out of doing so when I was young child. I was actually quite a “solid” child – but that’s just how I was born and my natural body shape. I believe the disordered eating and stress on my body caused my period to come at an unnatural age … i was very young maybe 8 or 9 I can’t remember. There came a time where the dance took over and we rarely ate together at the table as a family, I would always eat in the car on the way to dance classes. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed dance and appreciate being put in lessons but I feel like it negatively affected my body and would negatively affect my future. Binge eating definitely contributed to the candida over growth in my body of that I am 100 percent certain. Which is what I have been struggling to rid myself of over the past few years.  

&amp;#x200B;

 Enter into my teen years between 13 and 15 I was dancing at a higher more competitive level and at a dance studio that was very into classical ballet. Everyone was thin and in great shape. That was the start of starving myself and my body. I would easily skip breakfast and lunch with my parents working and didn’t matter what I ate for dinner as I would dance 4-5 hours per night burning it and much more off. My hair fell out, I had zero energy or focus and I got down to an alarming weight for my body type – lower than I had ever been before.  

&amp;#x200B;

 

I liked the way I looked though, it felt good to me (just part of the disorder) That summer I came back from national dance competition in Virginia Beach and I had an audition – I didn’t have a successful audition and that’s when things spiraled out of control and back into the binge eating. I didn’t see it then but I can clearly see the cycle now. I was so unhappy about failing that audition. I had put all of my eggs into one basket and could not handle the undesirable outcome of that situation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zfml1cr08g821.png

Age 16 to around 27 I was stuck in that cycle. I would binge and binge and binge – gain an alarming amount of weight(nearly 90 pounds), try to get healthy lose a few pounds and then something would happen that I would negatively react too and the cycle would start all over. The scariest and worst it got was when I moved away to University. I had nobody watching my every move and made very poor food choices (binging in bed while watching tv shows and movies, binge drinking with friends etc) I bet in my worst moments I would take in over 10 000 + calories easily. I don’t just mean binging on one bag of doritos – oh no – I would eat dinner with roomates, on the way home stop at Mcdonalds and eat another dinner…get home and order a large pizza and eat all of that to myself. I would pass out feeling dizzy, painful, sore…and wake up feeling hungover. I would do this to myself over and over and over and over again and it negatively affected all of my friendships and relationships simply because I was trying to hide it from them and if they realized they had no idea how to understand my situation or how to help me which I can’t fault them for. Now, we all have different idea of what binge eating is - but what I describe above is definitely my experience of binge eating. I ended up moving back home because I knew I needed help. Although the help I was given was not really to find the cause of my binge eating problem but help was given into me losing weight. I did end up losing weight but again got caught in the binge cycle. Just \`losing weight\`helps nothing. You have to do the work. You have to figure out away to get your mind, body and soul healthy. 

 It wasn’t until I met Brent, my husband and moved in with him that the binge eating seemed to slow down. With Brent, I feel my most beautiful, whole, self.  We do our grocery shopping together, we plan our meals together and for the most part, we cook together and eat our meals together at the table.  He knows all my secrets and knew all about my struggle with binge eating and my weight.  I got the Binge Eating under control around 1.5-2 years ago ...but I stayed at my highest weight (260 for transparency) up until now.  I was so happy not to go up anymore that it didn't bother me that I was not losing. I have maintained this weight for almost 3 years now.  I wasn't even motivated to lose for our wedding. My mind was right, I had not binged in so long and that's all that mattered to me. And to an extent, that's still true. I'm happy to share with you what worked for me or rather is working and what kinds of things I still do in the moment to stop myself from those epic binges. Might even share some of those stories as well. I don't think this subject gets talked about enough - Binge Eating. Food is a drug - especially sugar and we are self medicating with it daily.   
   
  I want people to know that binge eating disorder is just as prevalent and just as negative and toxic as all of the other eating disorders out there. It can really get in your head and leave some lasting damage on not only  your body but your emotions, mind and spirit. I will forever be a recovering binge eater and I take it second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour and day by day.

ac5rai,1546522461,"Long story short. I've been bingeing and dieting since I was a little kid.

I succeeded in dieting sometimes, but controling weight was always a struggle.

Ten years ago I lost 110 pounds, but then I regained it all, reaching 300 pounds. It was rought. Bad times, depression was hard.

But some time ago my depression finally got better and I'm trying to lose weight for good.

I'm almost 40 years old now and stakes are higher, I need to control my weight for health.

So three years ago, my weight was around 300 pounds. Today I'm 235 pounds. So I lost 65 pounds in the last three years.

In 2018 I was cured from depression, found my will to live (bodysurfing), and I worked hard on taking care of myself. Therapy, phisiotherapy, doctors, check ups, gym, etc. But I lost only 10 pounds in the whole year of 2018 and it made me feel like such a loser! That's because I had a terrible binge week in the holidays and gained 13 pounds, so depressing.

Although I might be making progress in the big picture, I feel stuck, BED continues to hold me back and screw up my life. 30 years dieting and struggling and I still feel like a loser. It's tough.

I'm commited to fight hard in 2019, but I'm not sure how, for I'm already struggling for so many years and it always feels like I'm losing the fight. At least I'm 1 day without bingeing now, that's a relief.

abrj9j,1546417795,"So yes, I am obsessed with them.

The first time I binged on them was, as far as I can remember, when I was an elementary school student. We, my entire family, went for a trip (I don't know where we went, because, as usual, my parents have never provided the itineracy, plans and necessary information). We stayed at an inn. They served dinner. Rice was served in a big container. I kept eating rice. I think it was because I was feeling anxious, insecure and lonely. Filling my stomach with a lot of carbs made my body warm and somewhat eased my loneliness. Also, I felt good because I got attention from my family members when I showed I could eat a lot; they pointed me out and laughed at me. I was neglected and abused. No one has ever showed any genuine care towards me, so even though that was a wrong way to get attention, it was still fulfilling somewhat. Looking back, this is quite miserable and I was a very poor little child...


In my adult life, I still depend on carbs to feel better. I am still emotionally empty and starving.",-0.5754638605245579,bingeeating
ab2zo1,1546225373,"As a teen, I would go into the basement kitchen while everyone was asleep and eat as much as I could get my hands on. Same with after school when nobody was home. That was more of an ""opportunity grab"", whereas now it's more mood-based.

When I lived on my own during college, I was really depressed because I was alone and I'd binge eat. One time I sat on my bed and ate an entire box of 50 assorted halloween chocolates.

Now I live with my husband who works from home, and he is at home ALL THE TIME unless we go out together, if he goes out with his friends, or to play sports. I binge eat when he's gone, but I'm fine when he's home. Tonight I ate over 5000 calories, mostly in sweets. Even at work, I ate 17 chocolates today and 15 yesterday because I was alone and anxious to go home. And I don't take my time, I chew so fast that my jaw hurts. And I feel sad the whole time. There's no guilt, just sadness and numbness.

I always try to control my urges and talk myself through it, but the sad feeling of being alone makes me lose it. I know I should reach out and talk to people, but I honestly have such a hard time even getting off of the couch when I'm alone. I've had this problem with my mood dropping + binge eating when I'm alone for almost 20 years and nothing helps except for being with people. But people can't always be there with me!

Ok,  finally dealing with the binge eating that has slowly taken over my  life the past 2/3 years. I'm in my mid 40s and up until age 41 or so I  always had a slim, toned body people marveled over. Had never been over  125 lbs at 5.5"" ever, and was always able to eat normally without  depriving myself occasional treats. Now I am 30+ pounds heavier and  despite working out for an hour and a half till I am wringing wet 4  times a week. I simply can't stop binging myself sick on sugar &amp;  junk food when I am stressed and now the weight gain and the feeling of  total helplessness to ever stop it is causing the stress which triggers  the binging. It is NOT my age and metobolism. In the rare pockets of  time I've been able to ""go back to normal"" for a few weeks I loose  weight in a flash. I simply CAN'T stop pigging out on chocolate, pizza,  etc once I start and recently that has become almost every day. So I've  made an apt to see if I can get into outpatient treatment at a local  rehab. It's effecting my physical health as well, too drastically, I  feel nauseous, light headed and out of breath daily. Not to mention  irritable off the f\*cking charts. My question is - since I don't purge,  don't have anorexia, don't have issues eating in front of others, don't  ""hide"" food to binge on or have OCD rituals around food - HOW will they  possibly help me?

9l7f98,1538616400,"Hello, beautiful sub.  


It's my first time posting here. I have been overweight all my life, still am, however 2 years ago I started a weight loss journey, for health purposes. I did good! It was all good. I'm 27 years old, and I can finally say I binge eat till I feel bad.   


I don't want to excuse myself. The past year my life became much harder after finding out my mother is cheating on my father and plans to leave us (my father, my 22 year old disabled brother, and me) at some point. The family issue isn't touched, yet, and probably won't for the rest of the year. But I've been eating since I was 6 years old, when mom used to work and dad was away (working, mind you) and I was left alone at home for a couple of hours. I never had much friends. Food was my only comfort, my only friend. Sugar has always been the most delicious poison there is. I indulged in ""comfort food"" because I was lonely. Then my brother came to this world, and his disability and my parent's journey with him made me mature forcefully. I couldn't really bother them with my emotions, because I knew my brother needed them.  


Food was my safe place. Eating, eating, eating, and eating more was a way to fill that void in me. It felt good in my tongue and for a couple of hours, it was all fine. Not much has changed. I am overweight, constantly trying to diet, not doing any exercise ( I did yoga for over a year, and I was doing so great). But after last year dismay with my mother, it's all been coming back in circles. I eat, I eat, I eat, I feel full- SO bad, my stomach hurts so bad from eating. I lay down in bed thinking about how hard I tried to be a good daughter yet I couldn't be useful to anyone in my family, ever. I feel very useless as a person, at home. Work is so different, though! It's like living a double life, at work it's all perfect (I love my job), stressful (yes, more eating!) but I feel like I am important. So there I am again, in bed, feeling disgusted with my body, with myself. Hating myself.  


Today, after 27 years, I look at myself in the mirror after having eaten so many things that my stomach hurts, and I can tell that I'm doing it because I feel sad. But I can't stop eating... I am fed up with food. I don't want more food. I am hurting myself, and I feel like I'm in a black hole. A hole I want to fill with things that taste nice- seemingly harmless.

9jcv8s,1538054884,"Hi all,

This is my first post ever about my problem. I've been struggling with binge eating over the past month or so.

&amp;#x200B;

About me: I have always struggled with my weight since I was in middle school, I have always tried to take care of myself and exercise and eat well, but always seem to falter.

&amp;#x200B;

My recent dilemma: Recently I partook in several hard drugs within the span of a month (meth, ecstacy, cocaine) and I think it took a major toll on my brain's reward system, for I have been addicted to using food to get high for the past month. 

Yesterday, I was so dissatisfied with my situation and I made a silent agreement to myself that yesterday would be the last day I would binge, and I woke up this morning with a strange sense of relief and motivation. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I prevent myself from falling into old habits in the future? I'm afraid this is just another wave of superficial motivation, and in my experience my motivation to improve my health always falters after a while. I've read that motivation is not reliable, but instead habits and strengthening your willpower are the keys to success.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

How do you turn your motivation into habits?

Has anyone else had this problem after taking hard drugs?

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all responses are welcome. This is also my first time reaching out to anyone about this (absolutely no one in my life knows I struggle with binge eating) and a major part of writing this post is to just connect with others who are struggling with the same thing. Thanks so much for taking the time to read and respond.

Hi guys. I am new here, and I first have to say that I love that there's a community such as this.

During a binge episode, I asked myself, why is it so hard for me to stop eating when I clearly am not hungry and have had more than enough food to last me for a day or nearly a week?

My answer was that I feel entitled to eat all of the foods, whenever and however much I want. I shouldn't have to be denied and delay my food cravings and urges. Especially when they make my tongue and tummy feel happy and full, and gives an almost instant great pleasure.

But, I wonder if self-control is just apart of life, so I should just accept that sometimes self-control matters more than getting what I want right away, even if it isn't good for me. But I don't see where else self-control matters as much as it does when denying such a guilty pleasure as delicious food.",-0.1807692763260416,bingeeating

We are an early stage startup from Sweden working on a tech product focused to help people with BED. At this moment we are doing research and hope to get as many people involved as possible. Please if you have any interest in participating down the line, let us know at: healstack@gmail.com

We posted couple of months ago a summary of what we are trying to achieve and we want to get more involved in the community over the next months - as we feel that knowledge is extremely important for us to understand what someone needs to be able to improve their situation, stripping down anything unnecessary.

Binge eating, like other eating disorder and many other physical and mental health issues has no single cause. Multiple factors and pathways have been suggested. The relative importance of various factors generally, and for specific individuals who have binge eating disorder may vary. By participating in this study, you will allow us to gain some insight of the degree to which the factors and model we are examining applies or not.

We therefore invite all people aged 18 years and over from all genders to participate in this study. If you would like to participate within this study, please access the survey at the link below. The survey should take approximately 40-50 minutes to complete. All responses are completely anonymous and confidential.

I would also greatly appreciate it if you could forward this advert and survey link to your friends, family members, and colleagues, as I am hoping to reach as many people as possible to participate within this study. Thank you for your assistance and consideration.

The worst is my weight. I've moved from house to house for a few months now, and it seems like the first few weeks in a new place my binging gets worse. I gain ~10lbs, and have to start from scratch again. By the time we leave I've lost the weight and gotten on track with my binging... until we get I to the new house. Then the cycle restarts.

the bundle of joy bought for a trip

nothing in the rich chocolate variety

Which has always favored me

See, the sweet fruity flavors would only be heightened

while gazing up at our massive sky

In the dark of the night

where the stars give life

while glistening like a cold clean knife

the skittles taste better in the desert

I want the candy in the cupboard

there is only a little left

Though if i give in I bet

I could clean it out

without a doubt

mini burst of flavors

and extra long red ropes

None quite the size they should be

their sweetness a fruit on steroids

and when eaten in bulk

the tummy screams to be free

For most, the amounts I eat

would not sit well

And I can say I'm much the same

though these days there is no pain

no physical pain

I can keep the contents down

eat the sickeningly sweets

hands full of color

Tongue a rainbow of sores

and still I shove them in

I want the candy in my cupboard

I want to eat all that was left over

the candy tasted great in a group

In the desert

But all alone I want to finish it all 

to grab two bags

fill my cheeks in sweets

feel the warmth of regret

The regret will set in 

Not tonight

Probably not tonight...

the candy is not the sin

Eating too much is the snag

If I have one can I quit

or will the compulsion take over

And over and over

Back and forth to the cupboard I'll go

stopping for air only for bits

In between the bites

because the call of the candy is too much

I go back for more

8sur5k,1529609204,"I love food… more than food I love the act of eating. Putting food into my mouth is a compulsion that goes way back. I remember finishing a bag of fun size candy that we had gotten for soccer party when I was 15. There were tones of the candy bars left so the “fun size” treats lasted me a ‘fun’ night of bingeing. I sat and ate dozens at a time letting the silver packaging pile on my bed.  I tried to hide my evidence but the next day my dad informed me that I should have really just eaten one or two pieces. ‘You must learn to control that urge.’

But I never did.

I still love to lie in my bed at night and binge out on any, although most of the time, it is everything in the kitchen. This, what I’m doing now, is a distraction, an alternative to walking into my kitchen and pulling out junk that I do not need to put in my body. I call it junk because most of the time the shit I want is sugar filled, high in sodium, with ingredients I can’t pronounce. I like the stuff that is incredible to the taste buds but feels worse than death the next day as it sits on my gut.

Writing down the compulsion instead of giving into it has saved me from another night of bingeing. I have decided to describe the want of eating because this is not a need. There is a yearning for the hand to mouth motion. It pushes down the insecurities and loneliness, shoving the junk into my mouth stifles my sadness. This almost feels like love, like the thing I have been missing. But this is only for a moment.

I will not binge tonight. I do not need just a moment of satisfaction. So I have written it down. I have let this out. Fulfilled in a different kind of way can I fall asleep?",-0.1007362148662685,bingeeating

I am Jelena, one of the co-founders of Healstack, a small startup in Sweden working on a solution to help alleviate a global problem of binge eating.

Healstack started from my personal experience with the disorder, after I have experienced how hard it was for me as an individual to find appropriate help without judgment. After being faced with many closed doors and lack of understanding, I decided to try a different route to combat this disfunction that is ever-so-present in the modern society. 

My partner and I have used our tech and design skills to develop a product that combines many things learnt along the way, simplifying how we approach recovery. We are still in the early stages of development and need more information from those who currently suffer from the problem. 

Healstack has been successful so far but we known that binge eating is a complex disorder - therefor we need more case studies so one day this can be easily available to everyone and enable everyone to get over the compulsive hump into healthy and stable eating.

We are looking for people to participate in our study/research phase in the upcoming months and it would involve us just asking some questions and getting more details about all the options that were used so far, current state and future possibilities. You can be completely anonymous as well if you prefer - only thing we would like to know is your country so we can tailor communication based on your timezone (since we are in Sweden).

Binging for me started in high school, I didn’t eat breakfast or lunch and played sports so by the time I got home I was so hungry I would binge. It wasn’t all the time and wasn’t an addiction like it is now but that’s how it started. These days I binge every single night- sometimes during the day as well.

8i1f07,1525822791,"It all started...when I was born...

Nah I'm totally kidding. It started like 6 years ago.

I was in highschool and I had been seeing an Endocrinologist for an issue unrelated to weight or Diabetes or anything. 

My weight at the time was around 130lbs. I was 5'3"". My endocrinologist told me I was overweight. I was a little on the curvier side, sure, but I didn't really have much to worry about at the time. But when I tell you that what he said scared the hell out of me...I mean it. No exaggeration. I was terrified. 

I started eating less and less from that point on, and I started working out. I didn't track calories then, but I know I must have been eating around 800 a day. 

A typical breakfast included a plain Chobani yogurt cup (90 cal) and sometimes a plain instant oatmeal packet (100 cal). Lunch consisted of some baby carrots (50 cals), a serving of low sodium Triscuits (120 cals), and a Babybel light cheese (50 cals). For dinner, I typically took small servings of what my mom made, but only if it was healthy. If not, I probably cooked up a chicken breast (120 cals) and had salad (&gt;100 cals) or something like that. 

I grew terrified of food and refused to go out if food would be present. As a result, many friendships became strained.

Needless to say, my weight dropped. At my lowest, I was 105 lbs. I thought I was fat still. I remember one week when I was already in dangerous territory, I weighed in at my gym and had gone down 6 lbs in just a week. My mom was pissed, but a trainer who heard me talking came up and high-fived me.

At this point I was being threatened by my Pediatrician. She said that if I didn't stop losing, she'd put me in the hospital. Friends were asking if I was eating enough. It was bad. And I was unhappy. 

One day, around my lowest, I was talking with my pediatrician. I asked her how I could lose all the belly fat I had. Because I was absolutely not skinny enough in my own mind. She just looked at me like I had 5 heads. 

So...it got bad. I was never formally diagnosed with anything, but I had severely disordered eating habits and Anorexic tendencies for sure, along with Body Dysmorphia. 

I'm not sure how long I was at this low point, but I do know that after a while, I began binge eating. The binge eating obviously caused my weight to shoot up. I hated binging... it made me feel awful about myself. Between binges, I'd restrict what I ate. It turned into a vicious binge/restrict cycle. This has been going on for about 3 years on and off. This cycle led me to develop Binge Eating Disorder (or BED as I more often call it).

And it's been getting worse. 

I've been trying so hard for so long to stop this. I've just about reached rock bottom in terms of my BED and my weight (I have no idea what I weigh now).

In the past several years I’ve had periods of healthier habits and I even went 2 years without binging at one point a few years back. 

I just want to stop binge eating and develop a healthy relationship with food...a relationship I haven't had for many years.  

Now I’m engaged, living with my fiancé, and I just want to lose weight and be able to eat NORMAL (I know normal isn’t a thing necessarily, but you know). I also want to be able to stay motivated to work out (i haven’t been to the gym since mid- March). 

Eating, especially snacks, has become such an engrained habit that if I don’t do it, I feel anxious and angry.

Like now. All day at work I promised I’d eat healthy and go for a run. But I’ve been on the couch and I just ate a whole bag of granola. Like, I buy these foods thinking I could try to practice self control... but then I binge. 

I’m new to this sub, so I just wanted to sort of introduce myself, see if anyone could relate and see if anyone could offer up advice. I’m just so embarrassed and so over this.

Because I need to put this out there but also don't really know how to talk about it without sounding totally pathetic and I can't say I'm particularly bothered about  whether someone reads it or not. So here goes.

Binge eating has actually been a problem for me for a long time, I just never really noticed it; I always ate what I wanted when I wanted and when you always eat what you want, it isn't quite so obvious. It only really presented itself as a problem (to me) in the last year or so after I started eating healthier and exercising. I'd be fine for a few weeks, sticking to a good diet and going to the gym frequently and then I'd feel a little low for whatever reason, have an unhealthy snack to make me feel better and suddenly I'd bought and eaten a share bag of crisps, a large chocolate bar, a tub of ice cream and two cupcakes, my stomach was killing me and I was going to eat more simply because it was there.

Sometimes (read: after pretty much every binge) I'd wake up in the middle of the night with horrible horrible stomach pains that kept me awake for hours. I'd vow that I'd never eat like that again and then do it the next day.

I found myself hiding the habit, always eating in my room alone, keeping the empty wrappers in my bag and disposing of them when I left the house the next days. Some days I would come out of the shop, get into my car and open a bag of crisps and eat them on the short drive home because I just couldn't wait.

I always bought the same crisps. Still do. Bought and ate the whole bag Tuesday just gone. Yesterday I bought my second choice crisps and several other snacks and I ate so much I was physically sick. I sat and cried for 45 minutes. 3 hours later I had to actively convince myself not to eat the donut I had left.

I always feel so ashamed and disgusted afterwards and it's difficult and mentally draining to pull yourself back out of that into a positive mindset. Especially when you know that you'll be back in that place in a month or so.

I’m a 27F. Back in 2013 I was 200lbs, and after battling with dieting and body image issues like most young girls their whole life, somehow I was finally able to stick to calorie counting and exercise and I lost 65lbs. It’s one of my best accomplishments. And when people ask about it, I always push forward that it wasn’t a fancy diet or about getting thin, because I truly believe those thoughts are harmful. 

All that being said, I struggle immensely still with binge eating. I haven’t gained back the same amount of weight, but I’m scared to find myself back at that point. I’ve currently just come off a week of holidays , and inhaled so much garbage . It gets to the point where I choose the worst possible foods at every meal and snack period, and of course I don’t stop when I’m full or in pain. And then comes the depression , which leads to more eating...

I’m struggling. Because I want to get a handle on it, but sometimes I feel like the only way to do that is to be extremely restrictive (which is how I lost the weight in the first place). I want to be healthy, I want to be one of those people that 95% of the time they are eating what they need and feeling good about their body, and then they splurge here and there and feel no guilt.

7bp9u9,1510183118,"(possible spoilers if you somehow haven't seen all of Frasier yet)

I'm rewatching Frasier on Netflix and at the part in Season 8 where Daphne just got back from the ""spa."" For those who haven't seen it, after Niles and Daphne finally get together Daphne starts struggling with her weight. This was to cover up her pregnancy in real life, but in the show she starts obsessively over eating and will even hide chocolate around the house. She puts on a substantial amount of weight and everyone notices except for Niles who is totally blind to it. Eventually she admits that she has a problem and can't stop eating, so they suggest she goes to a ""spa"" for a while, where they will help her get back into shape and work on her relationship with food. A few episodes later she returns and has made a ton of progress and looks great and has been talking to a therapist about the possible causes of her binge eating.

What it came down to was that her over eating was in response to pressure from her relationship with Niles. Niles has been in love with Daphne for years and sees her a perfect. They have been dating for a couple months now but have never had sex and Daphne is worried that she could never live up to Niles perfect image of her. Niles refuses to see any flaws in Daphne, he refuses to believe he was doing any harm and sees it as just loving her unconditionally, but it was holding their relationship back because they weren't being honest with each other. Daphne's substantial weight gain was a subconscious attempt to break Niles' perfect illusion of her. In the end they both confront each other about the other's flaws that they find irritating and it ends up bringing them closer together. 

I was really caught off guard by this episode because it shined some light on my own struggle with binge eating lately and wasn't a factor I had considered before. I've been dating someone for about 6 months now and overall he's a really awesome, attractive, inspiring person and the relationship is positive and healthy and exactly what I'm looking for as far as boundaries/low pressure about commitment/etc. On top of that he thinks I'm awesome and super attractive and all that. I think the fact that it's so easy is giving me anxiety and might be making me feel a sort of pressure to be awesome and attractive. I know I binge eat to cope with stress and pressure and anxiety, but I didn't consider that the reason I've been eating so much recently rather than feeling the urge for other coping methods could be that I subconsciously am making myself gain weight in order to challenge his view of me and test if things can really be this easy... 

Maybe this will help someone else gain some insight into their situation. Any suggestions of how to change my mindset or stories about similar experiences are totally welcome

The hunger pangs finally kicked in and I just went on a rampage and not feeling good about it.

In total, I ate -

Leftover chicken &amp; spaghetti, cold from the fridge because I couldn't be bothered to heat it up (probably about 1 cup total)

3 hot pepper rings

Probably 2 servings of tortilla chips with like at least 4 servings of queso

2  spoonfuls Greek yogurt

1 boiled egg

All of it with lots of Sriracha

This whole thing just made me want to have a better relationship with food. Sure, I can calorie count and portion control. But at the end of the day, I love food and I'm constantly thinking about it. ",-0.2407336997578781,bingeeating

This is not a cure but a transition. It will slow the weight gain until you're at a calmer point in your life. It's an effective method because most of the addiction in binge eating has to do with taste",-0.0652699294107601,bingeeating
6nyk0u,1500352688,"...hunger signals (i.e a pain in your stomach indicating hunger) are either destroyed or you're so addicted to food you can't actually wait for them. For this reason I believe anybody who binge eats or has an issue with food should start understanding the concepts of calorie intake, BMR, TDEE, lean body mass, protein intake, etc, as well as ADMITTING TO YOURSELF THAT YOU CARE ABOUT FITNESS. This may be a very useful replacement for your natural hunger signals.

6nyep6,1500350770,"re-frame ""daily caloric intake"" with ""weekly caloric intake"" or even ""monthly calorie intake"". This might help with the sudden loss of control people feel just before they binge - ""oh I fucked up today, might as well let myself go and start again tomorrow"".

Instead, letting yourself go today means you're likely to reach your weekly or monthly calorie maximum much, much sooner, and if you fucked up a little bit today then you still have X days to fix your mistake. 

If you accidentally ate 300 extra calories today, then eat 150 less than average tomorrow and after tomorrow and you'll be fine",-0.0254808860593132,bingeeating

If done properly then the calories you swallow are negligible, especially compared to what you'd have swallowed (calories are only processed in the small intestine, unlike salt which can be absorbed through the mouth; thankfully it's calorie-less).

5biakr,1478468862,"I see this sub isn't really used at all, but I need to talk about my stuff, so I'm just going to type away for funsies. 

I stopped drinking on October 1st and thought that was going to be incredibly difficult. You know what? It wasn't! I was in a crappy mood, and I WANTED to drink but I never felt any sort of compulsion that said I ""had"" to drink. 

30 days and zero drops of alcohol after 4+ years of drinking later, I decided it's time to start trying to lose weight again. 

You see, in 2009-2010 I was able to go from 400lbs down to 260 lbs. That's substantial for anyone, but very substantial for a 5'3 woman. I hadn't been that ""small"" since junior year in high school. I moved across the country, came out as a lesbian, and started meeting people! I met my best friend who introduced me to drinking, and we proceeded to bond over being newly out drinking buddies. I started drinking and did not stop. I was able to keep my weight the same because I was going out each night and dancing, running around, or otherwise being active. I ended up meeting my wife in 2013 and that all stopped. We became home bodies and my weight bounced up to 355 again. I kept drinking and began smoking while I was drinking. Fat, drunk, and smoking. And horrifically depressed. 

So, I kicked the drinking (permanently? temporarily? I don't know) and smoking (for-fucking-ever) and now I'm working hard at the food. I've found that eating a low carb diet makes me feel best, but of course I love carbs. I did keto back in January-March and lost 30 pounds without even trying. My life got rocked with multiple family things and I struggled to get back on board. Now, I'm trying again to meal plan, eat mindfully, and not binge. Since October 31st, I binged once (Friday) and it was really frustrating. This is the first time I've been mindful really about my bingeing (I know I've had a binge disorder forever, but I have great ways of ignoring that I know it when I'm bingeing). This time, though, I kept saying ""don't do it. it isn't good for you"" but continued on with the binge until I was out of control. 

I woke up on Saturday morning and went back to eating keto, which is a first for me. Usually when I screw up, I say fuck-it and stop trying to eat a certain way (unless pizza and diet coke is a lifestyle). 

So, that's where I am at today. I'm listening to an Overeaters Anonymous lecture and I'm feeling pretty strong today. Today I will not overeat.

4ntfy6,1465782497,"Why is there seemingly nothing on the market that is specifically geared to help with this issue, nor is it acceptable in the mental health community to prescribe medication to help treat eating disorders? I've had to resort to off-label usage of other medications that I've had to order from overseas because no doctor will help me, just to try to help with my eating disorder and depression (I have treatment resistant depression, as well), and it's been a very difficult and frustrating process. 

Has anyone else found a more supportive psychiatrist who has had no problem prescribing medication to help? By ""medication"" I don't mean anti-depressants, as I've been on nearly all of them by this point - I mean appetite suppressants. I know some may think this is unhealthy and would just lead to bulimia, anorexia or another disorder, but I cannot help but wonder why nearly all other mental health issues are typically co-treated with both therapy and pharmaceuticals, but if I dare to ask for anything to help with BED, I'm treated like it's my ED talking or something and I'm being irrational.

4iqjys,1462903827,"I saw something like this posted on another website but it was really old locked and thought it might be cool to start one here. Thought it might help people to identify and not feel so alone because I certainly feel that way right now. 

I'll start. 

You swing by Mcdonalds to get a snack thinking a few nuggets would be cool intending on only getting a 4 piece but instead end up ordering 60 nuggets and two large fries intending on sharing with the family. Before you know it you end up eating one of the fry packs and 50 of the nuggets on the car ride home. Ditch the evidence in a gas station trash can hoping no one saw you. 

You feel guilty at the grocery store like people are judging the contents of your cart. 

You have ever ate a whole pint of ice cream and whole package of mega stuffed oreos in one sitting even though you are lactose intolerant which fucked your gut up for at least a week afterwards. 

You have ever binged in your car because you didn't want anyone to see just how much you actually ate. 

You attempted to control a binge by binging on something healthy and high fiber (I made some low-carb/high fiber muffins) to curb your appetite figuring you won't eat too many of them before the fiber makes you too full. After eating all 24 muffins in one sitting you experience the weirdest form of solid diarrhea ever (sorry if tmi).  

Alternately you attempted to binge on apples and ended up eating at least a dozen of them before severe stomach cramps stopped you. Or a 2 pound bag of carrots. 

You have ever ate a whole cake in one sitting then tried to convince yourself at least it isn't taking up space in the fridge. ",0.0775018398120123,bingeeating
