18,8SevenSeas,t5_s5o7i,"Hey guys. It’s been 300 days since I decided to work hard at recovery. Recently I’ve been struggling because my life is hectic and I’m deeply unhappy. Over the last 300 days I’ve seen a lot of changes and I’ll put them here to remind myself.\n\nThe Good: \nMy mood is a lot more stable. Once I stopped restricting to the point of tipping my body over the edge I also stopped becoming an angry, hungry animal a few times a week. I’m not mentally healthy by any means but it’s better. \n\nMy hair is almost fully regrown. It will take some time still for it to all be the same length but the empty places all have baby hair at least. \n\nI have far fewer pains related to eating now. I can eat almost anything without debilitating cramps. \n\nMuscles! I’m strong now and people gasp when I tie my hair up because they don’t expect me to be stacked and jacked.  \n\nThe Bad: \nChronic constipation and general weakening of my body gave me uterine prolapse. I’m paying quite a lot to attend physical therapy to strengthen my muscles. In the same way I also have some incredibly weak muscle groups found in therapy that I’m working on. \n\nMy skin is still breaking out in severe adult acne. I can’t prove that the restriction caused this but knowing how hormones work I feel like it played a part. \n\nWithout delving too deep, my body composition isn’t where I want to to be. I’m hoping that another year of following the plan will help my body to achieve balance. \n\nThanks for letting me talk into the void. There are many more points that could be discussed but these are the pressing ones.

My old jeans take up so much space in my drawers because she won’t let me get rid of them when I tried cause she said “if you lose a little weight you’d fit into them again” 🙃 I used to be really small at my worst and it hurts. I want to be that again and it makes me want to restrict. I started going to the gym but I want to start limiting my calories again because I hate my body and being overweight. I feel disgusting and I hate my body right now. Trying to go to the gym failed already and eating healthy is impossible since I’m extremely picky. So it feels like starving and b/p is my only option at this point. I tried to get help before for this but nobody takes me serious especially since I’m actually fat now. “Fasting” again and working out as well as cutting my calories and only having water and less other drinks sounds good to me 🙁 I’m 5’2 and !173! Lbs and my bmi is !31.6! I’m literally disgusting. I used to be !111! Lbs which made my bmi like !19.7! 😕,1673765497,Relapse?

I might have a hope for recovery tbh. I always have been an all or nothing person - eating just junk and binging or eating nothing.\n\nBut when I allow myself to just… eat like a normal fucking human… surprise surprise - i kinda do. \n\n\nOn a first day I ate mostly plain oats, bread, nuts, plain dairy, really enjoyed a nice hot chocolate and eating too much of a sugary thing didnt feel nice + I was craving oats especially with cacao and walnuts. \n\nNext day I did binge on sugar a bit more but because I worked out and I think it might have been my glycogen that was depleted. I allowed myself to just go ham on the sweets and I actually stopped when I felt full. They were not the worst types of sweets either tbh! (I had hot chocolate with protein powder mixed with milk and “cluster rocks” basically chocolate mixed with nuts into these “rocks”, dutch people might know them as pindarotsjes but I made them from walnuts + cashwes and whatever chocolate i had leftover fucking delicious);\n\nFor lunch I just had plain ass homemade “mac and cheese” + cooked with chicken and tomatoes. Just pasta, brie, chicken, tomato sauce and tomatoes. It was very good.\n\nIn the evening and for snacks I had whatever I wanted also. I was actually craving just some tortilla chips (i wanted crackers but didnt have them :( ), cheese or greek yogurt with applesauce. Also dried apricots for some reason.\n\n\nNext day was similar things but in different forms. Also had some bean cravings but didnt have beans :(\n\n\n4th day I was starting to crave mcdonalds but didnt want to start a binge period so i fasted. Fasting actually felt nice and i was not hungry physically and had loads of energy to actually do things.\n\n\nIn conclusion: I feel like I can actually eat moderately and healthy because I never trusted my intuition.

37,Alpinedreaming8919,t5_2zzq8,"Hey everyone... so I’m a little late to the recovery game. I’m in my early 30’s and seeking treatment for the first time. While I’ve had disordered eating most of my life, I don’t think I had tipped the scales into a diagnosable problem until the last couple of years. I have struggled with calorie restriction with intermittent periods of binging and purging by vomiting, laxatives, and exercise. In that time I lost a significant amount of weight and was praised for my “dedication” and “discipline.” It was intoxicating all while the disorder only kept getting worse... more “rules,” more self deprecation, feeling dizzy/lethargic and irritable...\n\nI can’t do it anymore... so I’m trying.\n\nToday is the first day in memory that I ate an exhorbinant amount of food (I’ll spare the details as I don’t want to trigger anyone but suffice it to say, I fed a family of four into my own stomach in a little under 2 hours) WITHOUT TAKING A LAXATIVE OR THROWING UP. And while there is a part of me that’s proud—there is a bigger part of me that is completely terrified.\n\nI’m not severely underweight (lower end of normal BMI) and so my disordered mind is screaming at me that I’m going to be SO fat from this binge. That I can’t “afford” a binge like that because I don’t have “weight I have to gain.” It’s telling me that I should restrict even more than usual tomorrow since I didn’t purge today.... it’s basically torturing me. I can feel how distended my stomach is and I’m trying so so hard to remember it won’t just stay that way forever and that I shouldn’t try to throw it all back up... but I’m panicking. \n\nI’m not trying to be whiney. I want to get better and I fell into the binge cycle but I’m trying to at the very least not follow into the purge cycle too. I guess I’m looking for advice? Tips? How did anyone else get out of this cycle. How do you not shovel every morsel into your mouth when you allow yourself a “cheat food?” And how do you beat the numbers game in your head to not overly restrict your calories to compensate later?\n\nI want to get better.... but this is so hard and I feel alone and freakish...

I've also struggled with weight gain for the past decade or so. At my biggest I was 220 pounds and I'm only 5'4"". In December of 19 I decided enough was enough I was tired of being fat just wanting to be thin. So I started working out and changing my eating habits. It worked wonders. I'm down 50 pounds since then and it really helped me control the binge habits. \nNow there is a different worry. Am I working out too much?  My plan was to workout 2 to 3 hours a day 5 days a week to help increase my stamina so that in the next few months I can help build our new house and mange the farm my husband and I are building. At first that was fine and I was doing great but now I have to workout for at least an hour or 2 everyday. I know I need rest days but when I try all I can think about is how if I don't do my workout I'll gain all my weight back and then some. And I only get more self abusive the more I try to ignore myself. So I'll workout. It doesn't matter of I'm tired, sore, sick, injured whatever. Even if all I can do is pace the house and stretch I have to be moving because ""moving equals burning calories"". \n\nI've struggled so much trying to heal myself from the disordered mindset that comes with ED's and I thought I was strong enough to not fall into my old habits but I'm scared I'm gonna sabotage myself.  I just want to be healthy enough to live my dream, but it's like my mind can't accept that. I have to be a ""skinny minnie"" as my father so lovingly put it, or I'm failing.

47,Annieboot,t5_s5o7i,"Just having a moment. Sometimes it’s really lonely being an adult (30’s) with an eating disorder... the recovery community is very teens/early twenties - even the majority of the people I’ve been in hospital with have been under 25, all but 2 under 30. \n\nThe illness is a bitch no matter how old you are... but when you are solidly in your career, have a home/share a home and responsibility- aka life has continued on... it’s like there is this split side of you that no one can know about... or, that is commended, because you “eat so healthy” (they don’t see the purging if I happen to let myself have a treat)... I manage to keep exercise in balance (because I have to juggle work, or study, life commitments)\n\nIt makes accessible treatment virtually impossible to find - unless you have the luxury of lots of leave from work and an ability to suddenly defer bills. Not to mention all the stories to cover up your absence. I’ve worked from a hospital bed in the past because I couldn’t afford the time off. Done some of my best study and best work at my sickest and from hospitals. \n\nIt’s like the wizard of oz... everyone thinks you’ve got it all together - but behind the curtain you’re a sham. There’s days I just want to post it on my public accounts just so I don’t feel like I have to hide anymore - so I can stop making stupid excuses for why I can’t go out or whatever... but the shame would be overwhelming. \n\nI am not my disorder - I’ve never had the opportunity to be, because I’ve always had to perform as an independent adult. But that doesn’t mean the disorder doesn’t try to suffocate me any less. I am not “the anorexic/bulimic/binge girl” but I am the “high performer” and I don’t know how to not be that, and the disorder - if challenged - threatens that.\n\nRecovery feels unattainable because I’d have to possibly be a poorer performer in my normal life in order to sustain the energy required for the therapy space. I don’t know if I can afford that when no one even knows it’s a thing.

I don't know why, but it was just really surreal to see for me. The fact that she, most likely, ate breakfast and lunch, or at least one of the meals, and then she got hungry so she just... had a snack? And moved on. I think it's amazing that normal people don't obsess over what they're going to eat and count up everything again and again in their head. She just ate it because she was hungry and it was the food she had on hand. I was honestly slightly stressed out by just seeing her eat it because I was thinking about the calories even though I wasn't even the one eating it.

51,Apacalypse-101,t5_rbmui,"She never eats breakfast even though she used to. I made lunch for everyone the other day, which was just a simple sandwich, and she told me that she didn't want one and she'd sort herself out later. I didn't see her have anything so I have no idea if she did actually eat lunch. She always takes the smallest servings of things when we do big family meals and she hardly ever has dessert. She also always makes jokes saying she's obsessed with salads, and saying she hates when she can't have her salads if we're on holiday. Whenever I bake something, she never eats it. Last night I told her to have one of the brownies I made the other day, which were cut quite small (maybe 6 x 6cm per brownie). She cut it in half and tried to give half to my grandma, but I told her that she never eats anything I bake and she should just eat the brownie. She told me that she'd feel sick if she ate it because it was too much, but I told her that it was tiny, so she cut the bit she'd cut off in half and ate that as well to try and shut me up. It seems like she was just trying to eat as little of it as possible, and it worried me because it's totally the kind of thing I'd do.\n\nA couple years ago she had a cyst on her ovary that made her stomach bloat loads; she literally looked pregnant. She thought that it was fat before her diagnosis and I remember her getting up at 5am everyday to work out. She was crying last week and admitted to me that she cut down her food a lot during that time, and saying what a hard time it was in her life. When she had the surgery to remove the cyst, she was so thin that she looked scary, and the whole time she was raving about how great it was and how it was like an instant weight loss fix. She did regain some of the weight, but I have a theory that the cyst made her terrified to be fat because she felt so insecure during that time. I've always noticed a few restrict-ey habits of hers since developing my issues, but I do feel like she's gotten worse recently.\n\nAnyway, the issue is that I don't know if I should talk to her, or maybe my dad, about it? I'm quite worried about it, but I don't know if I'm kind of blowing things up/projecting onto her? Maybe it's normal to not be able to finish a small brownie, I don't know? My perception of normal food habits is so screwed up that I can't tell if her behaviour is completely normal. She just looked so awkward during the brownie situation, and I could practically read her thoughts on her face, because I've been in that exact situation and had that same look on my face. But again, maybe I'm projecting? I guess I've been picking up on small warning signs here and there that last few months, and the brownie thing was kind of what made me actually become worried.\n\nThe second issue is I don't want to draw attention to myself by accusing her of having issues if I'm wrong. My parents kind of noticed maybe I had issues last october (they asked me if I was eating alright a couple of times) but I freaked out and started eating more so they dropped it. It's selfish, but I'm scared that if I confront her and I'm wrong then they'll start looking at me in that light and get suspicious? I don't know what to do.\n\nBasically, can anyone tell me if I sound paranoid, and how I should go about fixing this if I'm not being paranoid? I don't know how to talk to her about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; I've noticed a few signs of eating issues in my mum, and I don't know if I'm being paranoid, and if confronting her about it will make my parents shed light on my eating issues.",1672571293,I think my mum has eating issues and I don't know if I should talk to her about it,"[0.004243695159525765, 0.10212518556989406, 0.0009481057255780273, 0.06781271842158758, 0.09761039155446391, 0.0459943005032305, 0.33761733185773535, 0.30297306139320446, 0.0004122671988640534, 0.040262942615916335]"

People tell you you’re not seeing right because you literally cannot actually gauge reality when you’re barely surviving. \n\nFor anyone who feels bad about their body while recovering and doesn’t like what they see, PLEASE give it time and hate it for a little more. I don’t believe in saying to just accept and love your body when you don’t yet. It’s okay to not like it right now.\n\nThe thing is, your poor body image isn’t legit. It’s a sign your brain isn’t working right yet. All of your organs are doing better, but the brain is the last thing to heal. If you need a sign that you need to keep going, it’s that you don’t feel good yet, because you WILL. \n\nI thought I was different and I thought that everyone else would get to like themselves eventually, but not me because I wouldn’t be “as small” or look the same. \n\nWeirdest part?

I have been restricting since 6th grade,  and I feel like my body has grown up being used to how much I used to eat and I worry that I don't actually need this recovery because I was only slightly underweight when I started. I'm afraid that the process my dietician has me going through of eating waaaay more than I used to may not work on me because my body never had a chance to eat a normal amount since the onset of puberty, and that maybe this type of recovery will just make me gain differently than others**\n\n**If I binge like this, will it set me backwards in recovery and am I ruining my plan?  (I know it said no specific numbers so I won't say how much, but it was A LOT. )**\n\n**I'm also having HORRIBLE insomnia. I can't sleep for more than 2 hours every other night, and when I finally get around 6 hours at once, it's only because my body is so drained from being awake for days at a time that I'm forced to sleep.** \n\n**I've also noticed my face is really round and puffy, and I miss my old slimmer face. Has anyone had any of these problems???? I feel really alone and when I panicked and asked my dietician what to do after the extreme hunger she said she ""doesn't work on friday's"" and that we would ""go over any questions during our session"" (thursday).

A perfectly normal January? That's what she thought too, until she realized that her workouts were improving and, more mysteriously, she suddenly had the energy and will to live she had seemingly lost!\n\nIn a twist of events, she realized that the cookies had been giving her that extra fuel her body needed to do literally anything!

No, Mom, she doesn't need Jesus -- she's literally just forgetting the most basic of human functional knowledge!\n\nWill this time be the charm?

Sometimes it isn't anything to do with the ED, but it's everything to do with it being a form of harming oneself, in lamest terms.

Of course I cook for him and try to help whenever I can, and he has gained a bit, but he still has a slightly underweight bmi. It just makes me upset, I want him healthy, but also the selfish gross part of me is jealous and envious how he can go all day and not eat, or just game and maybe eat a few chips and that's it. He says he eats a lot and just had a fast metabolism, but he doesn't realize how little he eats. He's got the wrong idea because when he DOES eat it's unhealthy but he skips meals so much. And normally I'll be hungry and starving when he's just chilling with an empty stomach. And it's so fking toxic, but sometimes I'll blatantly refuse to eat until he does, or threaten to throw up if he doesn't eat too.

I didn't enjoy seeing him in such a light, I became a severe alcoholic and at that point just wanted to die and tried to kms with alcohol morning midday and night. My eye opening moment was when my mom and sister couldn't wake me up for hours and I apparently pissed myself so they thought I was dying and the moment they were about to take me to the emergency room I woke up.

Because, I struggle with my body image, I would starve myself, which was pretty easy considering that I didn’t even like eating. I was around 12 when the self starvation began, it was on-and-off behaviour since sometimes I felt pretty good but sometimes I would eat as little as 200 calories per day. \n\nMy sister is really thin. She’s underweight due to her inability to gain weight. I see her wrists, her collarbones, her spine, and I want that. I want to be thin, I want to have thin arms and legs. She is gaining weight and I’m glad to see it, she also struggles with her body image since she wishes she were at a healthy weight. \n\nMy dad would always say I looked ‘full’. I think about it a lot. I remember trying to become fit, in a healthy manner and he said that, and I gave up. He’s been saying it since I was little and I didn’t pay much attention to it because I didn’t care, until I did. \n\nI’ve never talked to anyone besides two people about my eating issues. I never told my psychiatrist nor my therapist, and I want to, I really do, but I just can’t bring myself to. I know they’ll tell my parents and they’ll make me eat; they’ll pressure me into eating. That is terrifying. The idea of someone watching me eat while making me do it is just not great.

153,Christin3rd,t5_2zzq8,"As the title says I sometimes strongly think I was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder. I started therapy with an intern therapist last year for anxiety and other things. After a couple months she told me that I had an eating disorder and should start seeing a dietian. Basically what I told her that made her come to this conclusion: I have always hated my body, hated my body in photos, hated certain features of mine, always been self conscious, been bullied for how I look, etc. I had gained a little weight during that time after moving and wanted to lose about 10-15lbs to be back where I was before, especially since my wedding was approaching at that time. I was counting calories (only eating 1400 a day) working out occasionally. A lot of times I would go over 1400 calories. I was losing weight but verryyyyy slowly. I also follow a vegetarian diet (after seeing the dietian I realized I wasnt getting enough protein which I think was causing me to get sick a lot but now I know). In addition, my mom had an eating disorder at my age (she was anorexic and wouldn't eat for days). When I was around 15 I noticed I had gained some weight and started to skip dinners and I would lose 1lb every day. I got pretty low in weight (under a normal BMI) and my friend's grandma made a comment to me about being too skinny so I felt embarrassed and realized what I was doing was probably bad and stopped and just stayed at a normal weight after that. At the time I was fluctuating in weight around [135-140 lbs](#s) at 5'6"". I felt like I was ""fat"" and a lot of times I did look really fat because I was super bloated from GI issues (that later the dietian helped me fix). So with all these things she told me I didn't have Body Dysmorphia but had an ED. I was kinda shocked to be honest.\n\nSo I started seeing the dietian because I did want to get to the bottom of my GI problems but also wanted to hear them out on what I should be eating. She had me eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, wayyyy more than I have ever ate before. I told her this was too much food but she told me this is what I needed. I told her I was afraid of gaining weight and she told me I wouldn't. For awhile I wasnt gaining weight until a few months in it all hit me. My thighs began to touch and I couldn't fit into my clothes anymore. This was my worst fear and it sent me into a depression. I am still depressed and still unable to fit into my clothes, I am sooo uncomfortable and I feel like no one is listening to me. I have thought about purging and starving myself, things I never thought about before because I feel so desperate to lose this extra weight. \n\nRecently I gave some old clothes to a friend who to me looks so incredibly skinny and when she fit into my old clothes perfectly I was literally mind blown. I look back at old pictures of myself and realize I was at my goal weight and feel upset that no one told me I had body dysmorphia until it was too late. I know it would have taken a while to get me to see my body for how it was at that time but I wish someone would have helped me. My new therapist told me I do in fact have body dysmorphia but she has also always been under the impression I have an eating disorder from what my old therapist has told my dietian who has now told me new therapist (they work together). After giving it a lot of thought a huge part of me believes that yes I probably was high risk for developing an eating disorder but I was just dieting at the time (many people count calories and eat less then I was to lose weight but they werent diagnosed with eating disorders) I knew that being underweight was wrong and I wasnt striving to be that I just wanted to be on the lower end of my BMI. So I am just so frustrated with everyone and everything and I have been thinking real hard about dropping my therpist and dietian because they want me to accept my body how it is right now and I told them I will not do that because I am very uncomfortable and I want to lose this extra weight safely but I want to be in my old clothes and feel comfortable again. I end up leaving sessions with them feeling more depressed than before because they make me feel like I'm not allowed to lose weight. Also when I look up eating disorders I dont fit into any of the definitions so if my old therapist was wrong about my body dysmorphia maybe she was wrong about me having an eating disorder?

She told me the weight was temporary but it’s been 2 months now and it’s not going anywhere. It’s making me super depressed and I feel myself wanting to go back into my old ways because it seemed to be working before. I’ve told this to both my therapist and dietian but they always brush it off or when I ask my dietian how can I safely lose weight she just starts talking about how it’s normal for our bodies to change at this age and that we need to learn to accept it. But I can’t accept it. I may not look “fat” to most people but I’m much heavier then I used to be and my goal weight is not under weight it’s just average for my height (right now I feel like I’m on the edge of being average weight/over weight). I’m so frustrated that I can’t get any guidance from them over this. Also I try to work out but because I’m so depressed about my body it takes everything in me to make it to the gym or off the couch after work so if I’m lucky I’ll only go twice a week. It’s also triggering for me to go to the gym sometimes when I see really fit and beautiful people. I just don’t know what to do.

156,ChristineBrillon,t5_2zzq8,"Hello. I am a 22 year old college student who has been suffering from depression and anxiety since middle school and an eating disorder since high school. I have been really down in the dumps lately because my dad has gotten laid off for the second time and I'm trying to finish up my bachelors, only to get news that one of the classes that I needed to graduate in May that I was signed up for the Fall semester has been cancelled. This class is only offered in the Fall so that's a really fun time for me because this is the third time this has happened to me at this same uni. I have been feeling so stressed and overwhelmed lately and I know I shouldn't be worried about being unable to help my parents, but due to covid-19 I live with them again instead of on campus.\n\nTo say that I have relapsed sounds like a huge understatement to me at this point. Summer of 2019, I finally reached 100 lbs. It was the first time I reached that weight and I was proud because I did so mostly healthily. I still had a decent amount of stomach fat, but not as much as a few years ago (to put it in better perspective I'm only 4'10). When I came home early from college in March, I weighed around 92 lbs. I maintained it until June and even gained 2 lbs in muscle weight which I was proud of (I really love having muscle). Now, between June and today, I now weigh 83 lbs. I feel like I'm a walking skeleton. I didn't intentionally want to lose weight because I lose weight very easily. I think it's primarily the stress and depression I've been feeling. Due to my family and I still trying to look for work but we can only work online because we're all high risk, it has been hard to find any work at all AND I also have to worry about paying my tuition for my supposed final year.\n\nI guess my main question is how can I get myself to slowly overcome this? I feel like I don't really have somewhere or someone to turn to because my dad doesn't understand it because he hasn't been through it. It just doesn't click for him even though he's done research on his own about it and I can see how much it frustrates him that he doesn't know what to do to help. It frustrates me just as equally because I don't even know what I need to beat this either. A lot of times I don't feel like getting out of bed and I feel like I'm having to force myself to eat because I don't get hungry anymore again. I think it's hitting me even harder because I worked so hard working out and eating more so that I can build muscle and I worked out and ate 3 meals a day for a solid 6 months. I don't gain weight easily, but I know how to put on pounds if I try hard enough. The problem is that I don't have the energy or the willpower to cook and eat. Another part of the problem is that I'm uncomfortable eating with my mom, but since I'm home I have to deal with that pretty much every day now. My mom used to tell me a lot in middle school that I was eating like a man and that I ""shouldn't be pigging out because I'll get fat"" and ""I'm a girl and she didn't raise me like that."" I feel that got ingrained in my brain and once I got badly injured playing sports and that depression set in, that all came flooding back.\n\nHow can I get over the uncomfortable feeling of eating around my mom? How can my dad help me get better? What are some steps I can take to get myself to eat more? I really want to get better again, I REALLY do. I don't want to lose anymore weight. I feel so weak, frail and un-energized and I just want to beat this thing. I just feel so lost atm and I know it's something I can't tell my mom either because she would just tell me to suck it up and eat and my younger sister is worried that I'll die after watching a traumatizing video about eating disorders apparently.\n\nThank you for your help.

157,ChristineBrillon,t5_2zzq8,"I am in such a tough spot right now. A lot has happened in the past 3 months with myself and my dad (personal matters) that have really taken a toll on my mental health. I had never seen my dad take mental health days until these past 3 months occurred and I wish there was more I could do to help him. \n\nOn top of all my personal issues, I got screwed over by my university for the 7th time once again delaying my graduation to where I have to take a whole extra year to get my bachelors. My eating was slowly starting to get better, but now none of us can afford health insurance so I currently can't see doctors or specialists. I do get free counseling on campus, but they don't specialize in eating disorders. I went from eating 1/2 a meal a day at home to consistently eating 1-2 meals a day on campus despite my hectic schedule. I know that's amazing especially since it's so hard to eat on campus and lugging everything to the kitchen downstairs where someone may or may not be using it is a huge challenge, so I tend not to cook on campus.\n\nI just don't know why when it comes to being home, my eating habits are worse. I have now gone from eating 2 meals a day consistently to eating 1 meal a day. I have binge-eating disorder and I have managed to only fill my dorm with snacks that I have that won't trigger my IBS and that I won't feel guilty snacking on because they are in some regard healthier than what I could be snacking on. \n\nI guess to top off the stress, I have no idea what I want to do with my life still or what I should be doing with it and I'm in my 8th out of 9th year of college right now. I feel as though I should have really honed what I want to do at this point so I could start applying to remote jobs (my skillset allows for me to work from home and not in an office space which I really don't like). Should I choose to move out within the year, getting a remote job would be ideal since I do have someone I could rent a house with and I won't have a car for a while due to paying off debt. \n\nI have spent the majority of my last few years just lost and depressed and anxious about everything. I don't know where to begin anymore or what questions to ask or even to get myself out of bed for that matter. Do I need to move out? Would it be more beneficial to my mental health to move out? The worst part about thinking about moving out is that I feel like I'm abandoning my family as I have a sibling with cerebral palsy. I kind of feel like I'd be walking out on them in a way. I love my family don't get my wrong, but my mother and I butt heads all the time and it's really frustrating and anxiety inducing for me.\n\nI feel like I'm just rambling at this point. For a TLDR: I'm not eating well when I should be at home and it was harder to eat on campus. On campus I managed to begin maintaining at least 2 meals a day instead of 1/2 or 1 meal a day. I have a lot of stressors and feel really lost and just don't know what to do anymore.

I was doing well but my husband brought home pizza &amp; garlic bread. Ok, I say to myself - a challenge. So, an entire personal pizza &amp; a quarter of the garlic bread go down the hatch.

Sorry to keep posting but it's getting a bit rough now.\n\nI know recovery isn't all sunshine &amp; rainbows but something happened &amp; it's so stupid &amp; it really made me want to restrict &amp; I wanted to let it out.\n\nWe were going to go to my in-laws for Boxing day lunch the other day. Fine. Normally I wouldn't eat until the lunch but as I'm recovering I thought, nope, I'll have something before because I'm hungry, even though I didn't know what they were making. Stressful enough. Anyway, I had a Cadbury's creme egg. I was proud of that. Not your ""normal"" breakfast choice I guess but considering I don't want to restrict &amp; just eat what I want, that's what I wanted.\n\nSo.. I mentioned it to my husband. I don't know what I expected...praise, encouragement maybe? Nope. He got mad! ""So that didn't even last a week."" He says. I asked what he meant. He told me ""I thought you said you were going to eat normally, we talked about this, why didnt you have some porridge or toast or something?"". \n\nWtf? So just because I didn't fancy a traditional breakfast food that means I'm eating abnormally &amp; he doesn't count it as a recovery win or anything but eating disorder behaviour? I felt *so shamed* &amp; judged. I was so horribly embarrassed. Guess I won't be having any more fucking creme eggs or telling him if I do. \n\nI just don't understand...it made me feel so so bad.

171,ConsciousAppearance,t5_s5o7i,"Me again! Merry Christmas to all who celebrate! I hope today isn't too stressful &amp; you manage to not only get through it but get some enjoyment out of it too :)\n\nI'm 3 days in to my self-recovery. I've already had a little slip but we won't mention that. I compensated for the compensation...if that makes sense...so I'm still on the right path.\n\nI am cooking Christmas dinner for my little family today. Gammon &amp; various veg. Oddly enough I'm not really looking forward to it as it isn't my preferred food but sometimes, when it's an occasion, food won't be to my preference or taste &amp; I have to learn to suck it up &amp; at least *try* it. I might be pleasantly surprised.\n\n The cauliflower cheese is going to be a bit of a challenge but I don't have to eat the entire pan or anything so it's not the end of the world. Food is just food. It's there to give my body energy &amp; enjoyment of it is a nice bonus. I also have candy canes on my Christmas tree should I want one. I had a mince pie (that I made myself) yesterday. Still trying to turn off that little calculator in my head though.\n\nSo...so far so good pretty much. A little blip, a little cry &amp; soldiering on is how I'm doing really. Physically there is bloating, discomfort &amp; wow do I need the bathroom a lot. But I'm sure eventually it will die down. From my half arsed research this is all to be expected &amp; just pushing through the discomfort &amp; continuing intaking food regularly will help regulate the old digestive system. Fingers crossed. \n\nOf course I feel guilt, shame &amp; utterly enormous but that's to be expected. I've trained myself over many *many* years to think that way &amp; I have to re train my brain to realise that is not correct. &amp; even if it was...who cares? I'm going to be the only one judging myself so harshly.\n\nThankyou so much for all the support I received on my last post. It's much appreciated.

172,ConsciousAppearance,t5_s5o7i,"Tl;Dr - Actually committed to recovering for real.\n\nA little update on ""I was doing so well"". I ended up purging again not 2 days after my last post &amp; just...broke. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being exhausted &amp; not present for my husband &amp; daughter. I'm not in life &amp; haven't been for many years. Reaching my ""GW"" has not brought me happiness, it has brought me despair, misery, loneliness, fear &amp; an even lower GW. I hide my body in baggy clothes, I'm not confident, I have no energy or joy. What was the point in having a stick thin body? I wanted it &amp; I have it but I never show it anyway. &amp; who cares? Wow, she can fast for days or restrict for months...big deal. That's not an achievement. She can be a fun mother, she can be a loving wife. Those are the achievements I want. That's the life I want. \n\nSo, after 17 years of hell...I'm doing it. I'm really doing it. I confessed everything to my husband. &amp; I mean *everything*. Total word vomit. I shook, I cried, I felt so embarrassed &amp; ashamed. &amp; I needn't have. I have an incredibly supportive man &amp; I don't know why I doubted he would be anything but kind. \n\nI am going to recover. I am going to do it with the full support of my husband. I am not going to bother with formal treatment as waiting lists are about a year long here in England anyway (although possibly due to my very low weight I would be seen sooner). But I am determined. This time is for real. \n\n&amp; I had the damn bowl of cereal this time...&amp; I kept it down. Then I was intimate with my husband after months &amp; years of avoiding that kind of closeness. &amp; I feel...relieved. \n\nI know it's going to be a long, hard path. I know there may be slip ups. I will be uncomfortable, I will be full, I may even have pain &amp; certainly my body image is shot to shit. But I'll still do it. Because my daughter deserves to have a Mother who cares more about her than a scale number or a clothes size, who can play without getting lightheaded, who has the energy to dance. My husband deserves a wife who doesn't freeze up during a simple hug or push him away every night &amp; shut herself away every evening avoiding all communication.\n\nSo, my wonderful ladies &amp; gentleman who were so supportive on my last upset post - I will probably still lurk around these parts but any updates from me will *hopefully* be happy recovery ones or just recovery ones. I hope that's alright with you, if not I understand completely &amp; won't update you. I have no friends so it would be nice to have somewhere to talk so I don't entirely bore the tits off my husband.\n\nThankyou so much for reading if you got this far.

I'm also someone who has had an eating disorder in the past. I've been recovering from it for about 10 months and it's been kind of alright, no relapses, just occasional bad thoughts. however lately these thoughts have been really bad. I'm really self conscious of my thighs and hips since, despite them actually being a normal size, i see them as huge and very womanly. I'm also afraid of my chest size. because of my recovery, I've gained more weight than before, which is fine, it's ok, i don't really care about weight but I care about things like my chest size and legs. i looks for advice but since there are not many articles or people sharing their experiences with ed's who are trans men, i never find the help I need. instead, i find things that trigger me more like people saying ""you should eat! you'll get a bigger butt and bigger b**bs!"" which is exactly what I DON'T want. but because of my increased dysphoria, my dysmorphia has been off the rocks lately. now, I'm not just self-conscious of my legs and chest, but my face and stomach. these thoughts saying i should work out and stop eating keep me up at night and takes my focus off of my work. it's driving me insane since I've been doing so well for such a long time and I don't want to relapse and lie to myself saying that ""I'm not hurting"" or ""just a little diet."" i want to not have bigger legs so i want to work out and eat less and healthier but i know for a fact that it will only make these thoughts louder. i want to go on walks just for my overall mental health but I know that I will most likely think about how I should make this another 30 minutes longer so I can work out a little more. it's driving me insane and i don't know what to do. i just don't know what to do. if anyone has any advice i would greatly appreciate.

The doctors said everything looked fine.\n\nThe weigh in fucked me up as I knew it would. My scale at home was a good amount less than what their scale said.\n\nI told my doctor a very downplayed summary of what was going on. I told her I “was” bulimic in the past.

The scale is starting to slowly go down by a small amount.\n\nI keep telling myself “once you enter the second trimester, this needs to stop.”\nI feel like the first trimester is more forgiving because there are woman who lose a lot of weight due to morning sickness, extreme food aversions and nausea that leads to throwing up.\n\nI never had these symptoms.

218,Ditz3n,t5_o3plh,"Hello r/AnorexiaRecovery!\n\nCurrent status: &gt;!Male, 18, 46kg, 183cm (Birthday, 18. September 2002)!&lt;\n\nI've been wondering if I've possibly ruined my chance of getting the more 'bulkier' physique that I've always wanted but never have been able to achieve...\n\nI've always been a guy on the skinnier side. I've been able to eat a lot of junk and candy as a child and I've never been what you would refer to as ""fat"". Throughout middle school, I sadly began ""feeling"" fat and slowly developed anorexia which lead me to be obsessed with my weight. This resulted in me being at a weight of &gt;!51kg!&lt; as a &gt;!17-year-old!&lt;, in &gt;!October 2019.!&lt;\n\nI made a deal with my mentality and my dad that if I could get a membership at my local gym I would try and gain weight and overcome anorexia on my own. I've had a sister who has dealt with anorexia and still has it to this very date, so therefore, my dad was a bit skeptical at first but decided on giving it a chance.\n\nTime went on... And from &gt;!October 2019!&lt; to &gt;!March 2020!&lt;, I gained from &gt;!51kg!&lt; all the way to &gt;!63.5kg!!&lt; I was proud, I was happy, and overall I was feeling great with myself for once! I had made my dad proud too which was the best of all! Throughout all of this, I was eating &gt;!3300-3500 calories!&lt; every day and tracking it with MFP. Over a longer period of time though this became an obsession without me noticing...\n\nI had to be EXACTLY and PRECISELY with my daily calorie count. Anorexia was gone but Orthorexia slowly developed. I couldn't have candy, junk, etc. since it would ruin my ""muscles"". I had to be exact because I would rather build more muscle than fat during my bulk. (Who wouldn't?). This resulted in me not being able to go out to restaurants either or meet up with friends without bringing meals or saying ""no thanks"". I isolated myself more and more and lost a lot of friends during that period. However, I never saw it myself...\n\nThen the LOCKDOWN came which only made it worse. ""If I couldn't work out, how could I be able to eat all this food? Wouldn't it just turn into fat?"" I had to do something!"" I went into MFP and slowly decreased my daily calorie goal. At first &gt;!2500, then 2300, then 2000 and so on... !&lt;While slowly decreasing my calories, I then increased my cardio and overall fitness. I went out walking &gt;!10k steps daily at 6:00 in the morning!&lt; and my dad slowly started noticing it.\n\nHe became angry and worried because he thought I would develop anorexia all over again and end like my sister who was close to dying. He couldn't let that happen again and therefore made a rule at home against all excessive cardio. This was a bad idea for my mentality...\n\nFrom March to Now I went on a SERIOUS crash diet.&gt;! Under 1000 calories was consumed daily!&lt; and I lost weight fast. &gt;!From 63.5kg to now 46kg.!&lt; I now deal with dry skin, insomnia, freezing all the time, slow heartbeat, cracking joints, overall tiredness, scared of weight gain, etc. All these typical anorexic thoughts.\n\nI WANT TO GAIN WEIGHT but my brain tells me it's not healthy since I can't work out because of the gyms being closed until 28. February (at this current time). Like, if I begin to eat without doing anything other than sitting in front of the pc all day, that it will all turn into ""FAT"".\n\nI'm eating enough to keep my weight which has been stable for &gt;!2 weeks though at around 45-46kg!&lt; and WANT TO EAT when the gym finally opens up. However, I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time not just gaining now even though MY BRAIN is afraid. I want to just 'bulk up' without counting calories this time since it will just trigger my ED again later and make me obsessive. Therefore I also looked around Sub-Reddits and remembered Dylan Mcknight. A guy that I used to watch when I tried to gain weight last year. He went and made the ""dirty bulk"" but I never did that. This time I'm more into just doing that and saying ""fuck it"", to maybe FINALLY end this ED voice/brain!\n\nSo...\n\nTLDR: Is it still possible to go from my current state/physique, at 18 years old, to the state/physique like Dylan's, at 20 years old, in a 2 years lifespan, or have my anorexia ruined it all for me? I know that there's something called ""muscle memory"" that I should have kept all this time, but maybe that has changed because of anorexia/crash dieting?\n\nCheers (Feel free to ask in the comments if I forgot anything.

He got really angry at that time, but maybe that's what was needed for me to realize I wasn't in a healthy state? \n\nNow for the problem...\n\nEvery weekend my sister comes home to stay because of her having a job in our city. She's 22 and moved out a while ago. The problem with her is, that she's anorexic/orthorexic too. She has been it since the age of 15 and because of my parents screaming and being angry all the time throughout the years probably is the reason I developed it too...\n\nShe's waking up at 6:00 and walks for &gt;!2!&lt; hours. She eats a small bowl of oats and then goes to her job. Her whole workday, from 10:00-18:00, consists of &gt;!2 apples and a thin slice of rye bread!&lt;. She never eats dinner with us, usually at 19:00, but always sits at the table, trying to be the greater sibling and getting noticed. She never eats in front of us and whenever my parents ask her if she wants something it's always a straight-up ""No...""\n\nIdk what's wrong with me, but I find her so TRIGGERING for my own recovery! The way she comments on everything, the way she acts, the way she eats. EVERYTHING! She lives off of &gt;!vegetables, chicken, diet products, and high volume salads...!&lt;\n\nWhenever I try to go out to the kitchen to take my usual meals, which is usually easy throughout the week, it's just like my brain can't take it. It begins to restrict seeing all these products. Both on the table but also in the fridge. She even told us she needed her own shelf in the fridge for all the diet products, so it's literally the first thing my brain sees when I open it...\n\nI really want to recover for myself, parents, and just overall my health, but I just seem to have this blockage every weekend that I can't deal with. I've already tried to say it to my dad but he says, he can't do anything about it since she has to stay somewhere when working, even though he does not like her staying either because of her behavior.\n\nI also don't want to drop out of my last year of college to start all over because of the loss of knowledge and also lose all of my friends...\n\nWhat can I do Reddit!?!?

I'm not overweight, and my doctor has never presented any issues. I recently lost 10 lbs as well just by trying to eat and be well. \nThen Christmas happened. \nAlmost any clothing item anyone got me was size XL. Now don't get me wrong, XL is NOT big, especially with the BS sizing of clothes now, but I am 5'4"" and 160 lbs at most. I'm not tall enough to need that at my weight. I totally encourage everyone loving their bodies (except for myself I guess 🙃), but I wear a medium or large at most. Otherwise, it is draping on me like a dress. This really makes me feel like I look fat and carry my weight awfully. I will tell people to get a medium or large, but my mom will sometimes tell/text them to correct it too. I feel awful, and my three other siblings are naturally tall, thin, and physically inclined toward fitness and carrying their weight more evenly. Makes me wanna hide during the holidays.

As much as it breaks my heart, it’s nice knowing I’m not alone in the battle. Nobody in my life knows anything about my ED. It’s developed after being restricted on foods after getting my gallbladder out almost 3 years ago this coming year.\nI can only eat one meal a day and I’m so stickler on this, I don’t even eat mints throughout the day in fear I won’t be hungry for dinner. It’s really embarrassing not being able to eat in public in fear of getting sick, either by food not settling or me convincing myself it wont. It’s a 50/50 for me, sometimes I throw up because the food genuinely doesn’t settle and I get sick randomly and sometimes I convince myself I should go ahead and do it so I don’t feel gross in the morning. I don’t necessarily care about the weight loss or what I look like, I just know I won’t be hungry for my one meal a day if I keep it in. I’m so fucked up I know lol. I’m also taking laxatives daily, which is a whole other beast to be dealt with.\nGuys, I’m so mentally tired. I feel like I can’t keep it up anymore.

273,Express-Bullfrog-336,t5_2tmc8,"Hello there,\n\nI made a post here yesterday about the situation with my girlfriend and me finding out about her bulimia and how it deeply affected the way this relationship feels.\n\nI talked to her today a lot and struggled very much with how to deal with this and have discovered and realized a lot of things that are very painful difficult but potentially lifechanging.\n\nSo I mentioned in my last post that I probably have a binge eating disorder. I never really called it that fully but through reading about bulimia and talking about my feelings with her I realized I definitely do and I need to take it serious. \n\nI also realized that both are in a way part of an addictive personality. Me and her both have a sick love hate relationship with food and I think our relationship triggered both of our versions of the same. And on top of that also a certain addiction to each other. We moved this relationship very quickly and that was mostly my fault because she wanted to go slow but i didnt and neither of us could or wanted to stop similar to our eating disorders.\n\nI skipped whole days of home office work because I had her over il the last few months. Thinking about not being with her after only a few months puts the same sick knot in my stomach as thinking about never eating pizza again or going vegan.\n\nI think the feelings are real and that we could be good for each other but that we have to radically change our relationship to each other and each on their own the relationship to food. I like her, i think she is smart and beautiful and mesmerizing and I love having sex with her. And Id like to have these things with her still but in much more moderation and the first step might be to realize that the romantic part of our relationship might be dangerous to both of us and that we could be better as friends with possibly intimate relations if she is ready to ever be naked in front of me again.\n\ni still want to support her but I think my almost manic addiction to her let me think I would do ANYTHING to make this work RIGHT NOW. thats not healthy. we both need soace even if it hurts and then maybe start doing healthy things together.\n\nI thought about cutting food as an issue out of our dates completely at least as a shedule or in the sense of ordering, cooking or going out. I also think that since we might be more similar than she thought we can support each other in a way few could. I want to maybe do a yoga or dance course once or twice a week with her to keep her around and develop a healthy environment and habits for our time together.\n\nas for myself I knew I had a sick relationship with food and very disordered thinking about it but never but the word disordered to it or fully admitted it until today. I will seek help from my therapist (hers already knows) and also from my gp. I will make a real effort to disrupt my disordered thinking and find healthy ways to deal with food. It will be hard as any eating disorder recovery is but Ill try and maybe me trying will help her fight more too. But I also cant take responsibility for her choices other than me not enabling them.\n\nI want her in my life and maybe at some point we can have a healthy romantic relationship.

This was probably 4 days in, yesterday I had a massive drop in BS and BP. At first I was like okay this is good cause this is what I wanted right? It made me feel better cause it proved that I wasn’t ‘failing’ at my Ed. In the end, it got to the point that I felt so so sick, and my body was telling me I NEEDED to eat. (I was at a party) I was waiting until dinner too eat otherwise I was just gonna go home cause I thought I was gonna faint. Basically all I’m saying is, even though I was happy I’d finally felt that way, I’m glad I’d stayed and ate. It kinda made me realise how BAD this disorder is, and wanting too feel that way is a sign of being ill itself. Moments like that make me want to recover. Which is great, but I’m due to go IP soon and I feel so bad going in and not feeling ‘sick’ enough. So I’ve gone back into my old ways just so I can feel valid again. Can anyone please give me some words of encouragement or help, I know I shouldn’t have too prove I’m sick before going IP, but I still feel the huge need too.

I'm also an adult.**\n\n\-------------------\n\n**Short summon of sickness history**, ^(might have a saying in your estimated reply.) *\[Feel free to skip if lazy lol\]*\n\nSo, I've struggled with overeating/ under-eating my whole life. I started developing a restrictive ED back in my teens, and managed to get back on my feet with the help of a meal plan and threats from my at that time doc to inform parents and hospitalize me if I didn't. I wasn't too deep into it so it went pretty ok.\n\nNot gonna go into what happened because I probably have a irrational fear of someone finding out who this is lol. But something very dramatic happened in life, and I started binge in my late teens/ early adulthood. Got obese. Was obnoxious to my binge ED.\n\nAlmost a year ago now I relapsed heavily on my restrictive and purging ED. I have periods of up to weeks at a time where I B/P 2-4 times a day at an average, but its been up to 7. I have also vomited a bit blood at least one time.\n\nThen it shifts to restrictive/ fasting that lasts 1-2 weeks.\n\n**TW NUMBERS:**\n\n^(For reference, bit over a half year ago, my BMI was 31,2. Today it is 19,6. My mom tries to convince me that I'm underweight but, not rly according to my BMI. Yeah, she weights more, but she's taller, and have more mussel mass, she still has a smaller fat percentage. Anyways, I digress.) \n\n^(I've lost about 2-4 kg a month.) \n\n**Some other physical symptoms I have**, is hair loss, I can see I have acid damage on my tongue, teeth etc. This swings a bit but I have periods of days where I feel so heavy I can barely get out of bed, or change positions. Stomach pains comes and goes, dizziness and tunnel vision every time I stand up. Haven't feinted yet though. Easily agitated. Sometimes my heart rate drops to around 40, and I think my blood pressure might be low as well. Feeling cold frequently even when its 20 degrees in my home, and I'm wearing pj's, 2-3 pair of socks, 2 carpets and covers. I sometimes get a lot of death anxiety, feeling paranoid. Having struggles to go into the store, or even into my kitchen with the lights on. Having to weight myself 10-20 times a day. Lol, just writing this makes me understand its kind of bad. \n\nLast night, I tried to fight my B/P urges, and they just grew and grew until I couldn't anymore, ended up having to leave my home at 3 o'clock in the middle of the night to buy shit to B/P on, even though I was paranoid AF of getting mugged or assaulted or what's worse.\n\nBut I'm still not underweight, but I might be in 1-2 moths if it continues in this speed idk.\n\n\------------------------------\n\n**My questions:**\n\n**^(So, I'm finally going to be evaluated for impatience over new years. And I'm nervous. I've been to multiple different facilities multiple times, for other reasons. And it hasn't rly helped me at all, and I haven't had a good experience.)**\n\n**^(This place isn't an ED only clinic, but they're much more specialized than anywhere else nearby. I also haven't been at this place before so, I suppose, I'm both hopeful and scared. The problem is that, they only take in one patient at a time with an ED. Which I understand, because its a competitive disorder, and I'm kinda happy they don't. So, my questions, I know people don't have a set answer, but getting estimated answer, or guesses even, might calm my nerves, because I feel like I have to know what I'm going into, this is also because I have so many other problems stacked on top of it, and I have earlier almost gotten sectioned because I handled the stay very badly, because of set other problems.)**\n\n**1: If you read my sickness history, the BMI stuff and the other physical symptoms, even though I'm not technically underweight, yet(?), when do you think I would be prioritized? If at all? Is my problems still big enough to get help, or get it within a set amount of time? I'm sure there's probably a lot of people that are sicker than me and need help more urgently. Like, I'm not even underweight, will they still take me seriously? I'm rly scared that they'll judge me because I'm not sick enough, or think I'm faking it. Sometimes I even ask myself that question, until I'm hanging over the toiled bowl again that is...** ^(I'm just so exhausted of this crap and I just want to get a life...)\n\n**2: If I were to get help. How long, on en estimate from minimum to maximum do you think I'd have to stay there? Again, this would probably be easier to answer if you're from my general area, and have read the post over.. How long do you think they would want to keep me there? And how long do you think it would take for me to at least get back on my feet so I can work more on it at home?

309,Foggy_Groggy,t5_2zzq8,"Ok so, I 've just been so depressed... I actually just got permanent disability financial support. So I'm financial secure the rest of my life, and I won't be forced into work, school or any activity that would literally kill me this is a rly good thing...  But honestly, I never rly expected this,  I always just thought that if I die from my ed, then oh well, at least I didn't have to make the choice to kms.\n\nI've never in my whole entire life even been able to imagine a possible and manageable future for myself, and now for the first time ever, I do...\n\nBut now I'm more stuck in my ED than ever before, and I have no clue how to get out. I've tried more or less anything and everything. And been told by my mental health team that ""they cant help me before I myself admit that I need it, and ask for it""\n\nSo, after a long time, and lot of courage, I just managed to break through the barrer and ask for an inpatient stay. Because if I'm realistic about it, I need help to get back on my feet at this point, so I can work on it at home..  The thing is, I have all these other problems on top of it, so I need all this ""special treatment"" or a very individualized plan, just so that it may be manageable for me to even just be there.\n\nBut apparently, the most specialized plan I could get apparently is that I can eat alone in my room, if they can trust me not to purge afterwards, which basically is the reason I want to go inpatient. If I'm completely alone there too, with access to a toilet, OF COURSE I'll fucking purge...\n\nAnd then they also said that after meals I could join them in the living-room if I feel stressed. Like bro, after 2 years of getting to know me, and my problems, and you still haven't gotten it in your brains that I have crippling anxiety, avpd, Asperger, I have literally NO tolerance for stress anymore, just 5 min can lead to a complete meltdown. And they expect me to sit in the LIVING-ROOM, with A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE, with all of this AND being stressed after eating?\n\nThe whole fucking point of going inpatient and get help in the first place is literally gone. \n\nOn top of that, the mental health team I've seen hasn't helped at all the last what, 2 yrs?  Its just 2 boomers seeing me once a week. I'm sure they don't have more than High-School education and ofc, work experience with being nurses and taking a few courses. \n\n90% of the time I've seen them, I've always just felt more frustrated afterwards because they have low asf IQ, and they make it out as if they know so much about what they do, but in reality, some of the things that comes out of their mouths just confirms that they have no competence, and that they barely know me at all after all this time. \n\nI had actually already thought about quit seeing them after going inpatient, and when I know I could safely work on myself on my own with the help of my family, but, now I don't even see a point in waiting and going inpatient first. \n\nSo I guess I'll just talk to them about quitting next week.\n\nMy mom will join my next doctors appointment next week. Not rly looking forward to it, since I've seen my doc on my own since I was like 14, (almost 21 now), and I don't even know if I can manage being in the same room during it all cuz its so difficult. But I understand that its necessary, and I might have to since I'm over 16...\n\nIf my doc doesn't have any better treatment options, that is actually helpful AND manageable, then I guess I'll just quit all treatment together, and just focus on myself, and my family, and I guess just get comfortable with the thought that it probably will kill me sooner or later, or I kms when I can't take it anymore.\n\nMaybe by focusing on myself and my family and things that gives my life meaning for once, maybe my eating disorder could go over by itself, but I can't really count on it.\n\nAt least I don't want to waste more time on pointless shit and being frustrated about not getting help or being understood, or managing to get better on my own. \n\nI've already wasted almost 21 yrs on just, trauma, family tragedies, being mentally and physically and chronically ill. I just want a life, and I'll take whatever I can get, if my only life is one without being able to eat, but still to some extent enjoy spending time with my family and enjoy them a few more years, then I guess that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not gonna pay 35 EUR a week over new year on them asking me what my BMI is (With no good reason to know it other than just them being nosy and curious) and talking to a psychiatrist FOR me with me NOT EVEN BEING there, and them forcing folders with information about MY diagnosis that I've lived with for years/ my entire life and probably know more about than both them AND their folders do. \n\nAnd them reading cringe-worthy unhelpful book quotes and them saying ""it gets better"" and comparing my situation to other people they've spoken to before, as if I'm just a ware and not a person of my own. Just for themselves to feel better when they know they're incompetent to help me and just wants to keep their job.\n\nIt doesn't help. \n\nAnd them not even helping me setting up a plan, or coping skills, or even refer me to someone or somewhere that CAN help. like, why even bother??\n\nI honestly just want to close this chapter of my life, and not think too much about my past anymore, and just focus on the now. It just this fucking ED that's ruining it all for me.\n\nI can live with anxiety, avpd, Asperger, scoliosis, depression, IBS and the list continues, now when I know I'm financially secure, and I can just focus on as I said, my health, things that gives me joy, and my family, which is my biggest anchor and reason that I'm alive today. \n\nBut this ED just isolates me even from my family, and any event, and I can't even enjoy food, which I used to, and in a complicated way still love...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\--------------\n\nI just want a life.\n\nMy only three wishes in life is, that my little family and I have long, stable and as joyful lives we can after everything that has happened. And that we stay as close as we are now for many years to come.\n\nThat I could get myself a permanent home, maybe look into some kind of service dog or something in the future. Maybe even get a partner or re-connect more with old friends I haven't seen in a long time.\n\nAnd being able to fucking eat, and enjoy a fucking burger again, without purging, getting anxiety, feeling shame, having to excersize and cry and having meltdowns.

317,FourBloodyKisses,t5_2ydy9,"Thinking of recovering? I’m so happy to hear :) \n\nHere’s a check list of things I wish I had known before starting to recover *AKA* reminders to keep you safe, calm, and know what to expect during the process.\n\n1. Expect to be very bloated for first week or so. (Refeeding edema). Caused by weakened GI muscles.\n\n2. The only way to get rid of the bloating is to keep eating. Restricting and fasting will only result in prolonged duration of bloating. \n\n3. UP YOUR INTAKE SLOWLY. Drastic changes in the amount your consuming will cause terrible nausea. ):\n\n4. Try drinking yummy liquids instead of full solid meals the first few days. This is easier on your digestive system. Shakes and smoothies are your friends! \n\n5. The first few meals or even snacks you eat may cause you to feel extremely sleepy. This is because your body is using the first amount of energy given to repair damage and digest. \n\n6. It is possible you will lose your period while in recovery. However, once you are both weight restored and have good nutritional intake, it will return. \n\n7. Some days will be easier than others. There are mornings I wake up and suddenly feel anxious over silly calories again. This is okay! Take deep breaths, and give yourself extra time while cooking/eating etc. \n\n8. Even safe spaces about EDs can be triggering. The MOMENT you get the motivation to, delete the photos, the apps, the discord servers, etc. You don’t owe them an explanation. You owe yourself life. \n\n9. Make a list of food you always wanted to eat but never could while your ED was in control. Check them off whenever you can! Even if it’s just one bite, or several servings!!\n\n10. DON’T believe that recovery competition crap. It’s okay if you can’t finish a plate, but it’s also okay if you do. It’s also STILL okay if you get seconds. Food do be yummy, and we’re allowed to have yummy things. \n\n11. A relapse is not the same thing as a lapse. Sometimes I have lapses. But that just means i’m human. Your body forgives you, please forgive yourself.\n\n12. FINALLY, recovery is simply recovery. Recovery means to heal from your past ways. It is not defined by how easy or hard recovery is for you. Your struggle existed, it was enough.

321,FrancineUrgot,t5_o3plh,"tl;dr it's a rollercoaster, but I thought if someone could use some insight, I should post maybe?\n\nI started recovery around 6 months ago, but relapsed after 3 weeks, and then came back to it in late October. What made me come back to recovery, was when my best friends sat down with me, and told me they didn't think they could sit down and watch me die anymore, and that it was becoming too much for them. So on the day they told me that, I started actual recovery.\n\nI had extreme hunger for a few weeks, and still sometimes now. I didn't run nor exercise beforehand, and so after a month, my aunt offered me to go to the gym with her. I also started craving a bunch of meats, so I naturally ate a bunch of protein out of nowhere. I started gaining muscle, and I can see I have gained so much muscle back, and yes, I also gained weight along with all this. The weight gain came super fast sometimes, and then would slow down, then go back to fast, then slow down. It's still kind of like that, but now it's up and down, but I honestly don't even weigh myself as often anymore, because it's starting to become irrelevant (VERY SLOWLY). My extreme hunger varies, I still have it on certain days of the week, and certain days it's ALMOST normal, until it hits a certain time sometimes. I will say, to people worried about huge amounts of weight gain very fast, I gained super fast within a week, and I had a massive anxiety attack, almost relapsed. In my experience, that weight isn't real weight, and it's just your body processing it.\n\nHonestly, I have had really tough moments, but I feel so much better and stronger now. I thought going to the gym would make me relapse, or restrict, but I ate even more because I felt more hungry, and I didn't feel bad. I don't feel lightheaded anymore, I can eat out, and I can be happy with my friends again, without feeling like they're worried about me. My advice, is be patient, and don't let yourself scare the living hell out of your recovery.

I always thought my friends wouldn’t like me as much if I wasn’t this skinny fragile person. Of course it’s your eating disorder saying this to you, convincing you the whole world revolves around liking you for being this way, or might be something similar. \n\nI know everyone always says to just “ignore the thoughts”. It’s not easy, it’s a constant war waging in your head, all the time. I never have liked my body, never. Even at my thinnest, even at my “normal”, or in my bigger body, I never liked it. I guess I just convinced myself that, no matter what, I’ll never find love, or happiness with someone, no matter what body I have. That’s totally not true, of course that’s something I told myself.

Sorry if it’s getting annoying or repetitive, I’m just having a really rough time- And I think this is where I’m at…\n\nI will emphasize again. I was NEVER underweight. At my lowest I was just above it (According to BMI standards). I’ve been in technically “recovery” (increasing calories. Trying to have a healthy balance with exercise) since July now. 5-6 months give or take. And- I’ve gained weight- \n\nIt’s not too “noticeable” at all according to people that know me. But I’m in panic mode because a few clothing items of mine have begun to feel a bit tighter around my waist and my thighs are wider. They still fit but I’m concerned if I get more fat than they won’t. I swear I look fatter in the mirror and I hate it- My personal trainer says I’ve gained mostly muscle and that if I keep eating my maintenance calories and exercising like I do then eventually my body will recomp and the fat will come off or redistribute, leaving a toned, defined and muscular looking physique which ultimately is what I want. That’s better than wanting to be a stick right? That’s gotta mean something as far as recovery mindset shifting.\n\nWell I just- I can’t trust it- If that was really my “maintenance” than why was I gaining weight and why can I swear I’m getting fatter? I don’t want to gain anymore fat or get too big for my clothes. I already had to completely replace my wardrobe once when I got too small I don’t want to do it again. \n\nI want to feel healthy on the inside- Mentally and physically. But I want to look it too. I want to look lean and muscular. Otherwise it feels like it’s for nothing. \n\nI’m slipping- I can feel myself slipping- Since last week a few days before thanksgiving, I dropped my calories again and haven’t gotten them back up to my “maintenance”. I can’t. I don’t want to gain more fat. \n\nI don’t want to gain too much fat for this very reason. I’m scared if I do it’ll just be counterintuitive and I’ll relapse into full on starving and 3 hours of cardio a day- I don’t want to go back to that.\n\nBut by cutting down my calories already- Aren’t I already relapsing?\n\nI don’t know what to do- I feel so hopeless and lost and I’m really scared. If I can’t beat this than- Well… I don’t know what I’ll do. I fear for my life.\n\nI miss parts of my life… I miss going out with my family and not fearing the food I wanted to eat. It’s the holidays. I miss enjoying all my favorite holiday treats. Even then I wasn’t happy with my whole life as it was or my body. But at least there were those things. It was bad- But not like this. It didn’t feel so alone… I feel so alone. \n\nI’ve lost everything. My health suffered. I lost my period and still haven’t gotten it back, it took me AGES to repair my hair after it fell out and broke a ton and it’s still barely as thick as it used to be. I’m never happy. I’m always at war with myself in my head. I don’t feel anywhere close to sane anymore. I don’t go out because I’m scared food may be around or I fear people seeing me so I don’t have irl friendships. My family loves me but I can see how tired out I make them, how scared they are of upsetting me. It almost makes me believe they’d be better off without me. \n\nI used to be the one in the family everyone thought was going places. The talented, Straight-A student everyone had high hopes for.

So I spend all summer on this regimented meal plan and for the most part, it worked. I found some comfort in the boundaries it gave me and some peace of mind in knowing everything I was eating was hand picked for me to achieve my fitness goals. I still binged/purged every now and then, mostly when I was PMSing or tempted by some dessert my parents brought home.. but I figured this was just part of it, that I wouldn’t feel the need to do this anymore once I got where I wanted to be.

377,GriefSoap,t5_2zzq8,"I might be wrong about this and I know there are exceptions, but having been in the ED recovery community for a long time, I’ve noticed a pattern where people with low weight EDs who recover into a slightly larger but still small/thin/average bodies do better in recovery, struggle less with body image at the very end of recovery once weight restored, and tend to be big advocates that recovery is worth it and it’s okay to trust and let your body do what it wants because it knows best. This trend is based on testimony I’ve heard in group therapy from others with EDs in the outpatient program I’ve been part of since 2016.\n\nIt seems like thin privilege does affect recovery, especially for people whose ED is focused primarily on body image/fatphobia/striving to be in a smaller body. It seems that when these people weight restore into a thin or average body, they have proof that letting go of their ED was good, that their worst fears did NOT happen (for example, gaining weight forever and ending up in a fat body), and it seems like the residual body dissatisfaction is more manageable than for someone who weight restores into a larger body, who feels the worst has happened, and who might conclude that trusting their body was a mistake. Again, these are observations I’ve taken away from others in ED recovery as I’ve been in a group based program for years.\n\nBut this seems to fly in the face of recovery philosophy and data, which shows that body dissatisfaction and EDs are somewhat weight-irrelevant. It’s just as hard as a higher weight person to recover as a lower weight person - body dysmorphia doesn’t care what size your body is, and thin people don’t struggle less than non-thin people.

410,Helioisc_Gloom,t5_33q99,"First time posting, but I think this is the best place to put here. I guess to be frank, I relapsed into a binge cycle for the first in a long time.  \n\n\nI used to binge as a teenager to deal with my emotions, and I stopped for a long time. I don't... Know how I did? I just, realized I didn't need to eat to feel better and it was making me feel worse. I suffered with a stint with ana for a while and I started recovery for a while, relapsed, and went into a stint of recovery again and now I'm finding myself binging on and off and I don't. Know what to do. I'm absolutely scared, ashamed... I don't know what is even going on. I know that I'm really depressed, but I didn't turn to food like this for years. I'm genuinely scared.  \n\n\nI started my day normally, I ate like normal. I wasn't overeating the day prior, I didn't feel like I was undereating- I walked and worked out like normal but today I woke up, went for my walk, and came home. I ate my normal breakfast, walked around, but started getting anxious and feeling on edge. I took a nap to let the feeling pass but it caused me to skip my work out at my regular time. I woke up, went to get some water and was feeling depressed by then. Next thing I know, I'm digging into cookie dough, having consumed a vast amount of lemonade, bagels, cookies, peanut butter, and wings. I don't even like these foods! I don't even like peanut butter or cookie dough. I wasn't even hungry! It was just, a mix of emotions and I've been doing this on and off for the last couple of days. I'll reset my day, and go back to how things are before the binge and then I'll binge again. I... Hate to say this but I even ate something that I tried to toss. I don't need to eat less, or with more volume-I just don't understand why I need to do this emotionally or why I can't stop. I don't like this. I don't even like binging. It doesn't make me feel better yet I'm just stuck... I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't a place to put this and I'm anxious posting here. I really don't like it, and I know it's a common struggle and I'm not alone... But no one in my family has the same issues. I used to be so put together and I fell off the track so hard. I want to get back on but when I do, I fall off again. It's a cycle. I try not to restrict to make up for it, I stopped overexercising because I thought I binged out of hunger- I would weightlift for context and underfuel, sent my body into starvation mode.  \n\n\nI want to stop using food to cope and stop putting my depression on the front so I can get on with my life.

412,Hexactinellida,t5_o3plh,"I’m 15 weeks into recovery and it’s been a rough road.  I’ve been putting on the weight fast as planned and I now have a “recovery belly”.  Yesterday I was in the best mood I’ve had in a long time after having a massage.  I spontaneously decided to treat myself to one of my favorite restaurants.  It’s a fancy place and they let you sit all night at a table if you want so I planned to make a night of it.  I was one of the first customers and I was in such a happy mood that I had a huge smile when talking to the servers and I was so excited to really treat myself.  One of the servers even remembered me from the time I visited 2 months ago.\n\nThey started me out with bread and olive oil and I ate it fast and happily, the massage stimulates my appetite which is a great perk.  When I was ordering my food, a server said something to me.  She has a thick accent which sometimes makes it hard to understand her and she was wearing a mask, so I ask her to repeat herself twice.  She asked my if I was pregnant!  I just told her calmly “no” and didn’t make a big deal of it, chalking it up to a possible cultural difference, but then her comment started to sink in and I spiraled emotionally.  I felt dejected and couldn’t smile like I did before.  I just felt so judged.  Even by customers.  I even started to lose my appetite.  I ended up leaving 3 hours earlier than planned and boxing up more than half my main course.  I made sure to order a dessert to go to not let anorexia win (and I did eat it later that night). \n\nAs soon as I got home, I called my partner and promptly started crying when I told him what happened.  This is so hard for me because the area I have always been insecure about is my stomach.  No one ever really thought I had a big stomach before or during my eating disorder, I found I really blew this “imperfection” out of proportion.  However when I am being good and recovering, I actually develop a stomach which is supposed to happen for recovery.  But it feels awful.  It was alarming to me how one small comment from a stranger completely unraveled one of the best moods I was having in a long time.  I just wanted to post and get some support.  Its so rough.

421,HubbyHasBlueBalls,t5_s5o7i," \n\nt I went to an eating disorder treatment center a few years ago and they used DBT almost exclusively (which has been my only exposure to DBT). It was a really horrible experience that caused me to get worse in the long run instead of better. Mostly this is because they take an approach of treat the ED first and any co-occurring issues can be treated later in outpatient. My personal diagnoses are PTSD and anorexia. My trauma history involves severe abuse including sex trafficking by a parent. Stepping into a facility where I was locked in and lost all autonomy and privacy was extremely triggering. Instead of helping me through it, they ignored what was happening for me and literally allowed me to drown in the flashbacks.\n\nMy biggest issues with DBT as a whole:\n\n* coping skills felt very basic and unhelpful. I had already learned these things either on my own or in previous therapy, it just gave a name for the skills.\n* The coping skills really weren't effective or helpful in what I was dealing with. It was like being given a glass of water to put out a forest fire.\n* Not having the space to talk about my trauma history meant that some really insensitive things were said that I doubt anyone would actually say to another person if they knew that person's history. I tried not to take it personally, but it really did hurt a lot and cause me to withdraw even more. It meant that my behaviors and triggers didn't really make sense to my therapist because she lacked the context of what I have been through. I often felt shamed for PTSD symptoms, couldn't be open about what was happening for me, and often times behaviors were mis-attributed as ED symptoms. For example, my therapist asked if I was having a lot of panic attacks. I was. She asked if any of the staff was noticing it because I have a tendency to withdraw and get quiet when I'm struggling. They weren't. She told me to tell them when they were occurring so that it would get documented. She said that having this would help them get insurance to cover a longer stay. But my panic attacks weren't about my ED, they were due to flashbacks and a lot of parallels between my abuse and the treatment environment. They weren't treating my PTSD, so how would keeping me longer help? Looking back, I think a lot of this type thing was occurring--where me struggling was seen as oh she's crying because she thinks she's fat, and not actually realizing I was in PTSD hell.\n\nIssues with my therapist:\n\n* She was very confrontational. I would try to bring up something that was really bothering me. She would immediately tell me why I was wrong or that my emotions were wrong, she's then square her shoulders back and sit up straight. I'd shut down and retreat from the conversation.\n* I felt minimized and dismissed. It definitely felt very cold, indifferent, and unsupportive. I didn't feel empowered in the recovery process, but instead that all agency was stripped from me and my voice ignored. It felt very much like an us-against-them approach, and nobody ever stopped fighting against me long enough to recognize I wasn't fighting back.\n* She tried to get me to call my brother when I learned that he was in heart failure. My brother is very close to my father, and genuinely it's not at all safe. When I was resistant, she looked at me incredulously and said, ""You don't actually *think* that your dad is going to come after you if you contact your brother do you???"" Seriously, yes. Yes, I do. I didn't run away in the middle of the night and cut off all contact with anyone who has any sort of ties with my dad for zero reason. I've seen my dad's violence. He also told me exactly what he would do to me if I ever tried to leave. It was sooooo hurtful. So minimizing. And made me feel incredibly alone and misunderstood.\n* She once told me, ""All you do is go back to the bad things that happened to you. You go back to what happened as a kid, during college, or right after college. You never focus on the present."" One. She had my timeline completely off. The last time my father sexually abused me, I was 27. The abuse didn't stop because I grew up, it got worse instead. I wasn't going back over the abuse because I like the discussion topic, I was literally in the middle of trying to figure out why I was being triggered by something that had happened earlier that day. For me, the easiest way to identify triggers is to go, ""Okay, what am I feeling? What does this remind me of? When was the last time I felt like this?"". Also, too, the only prior therapy experience I had, had been psychodynamic, so I was doing what I would normally do in therapy and what helped me. She never explained the difference in modalities, etc. What did happen is that I felt like I was being shamed for having flashbacks and not being able to keep the ptsd under control on my own.\n* Before moving down to PHP she told me that if I self-harmed once or lost a single pound while on PHP she would have me put in a psych ward. The absolute LAST thing I needed was to be told I had to be perfect. I needed, ""You're gonna mess up, and that is okay. PHP is a learning curve and we will get through it together."" The result? It shut down any ability to reach out for support when I needed it. I didn't stop self-harming, I just moved my self-harm to where it wouldn't be seen during skin checks. I didn't get every meal down like I was supposed to, I bought a scale and water loaded in the mornings before weigh in. This is the only point in my recovery where I have been dishonest with anyone in my team. But it wasn't safe to be honest.\n* I used to love running before I relapsed. When I stopped running, it was because I knew that if I couldn't fuel myself properly. One of my recovery goals was to get back to running when I knew I was healthy enough for it. My therapist called my husband in front of me and told him that I was to never run again. No running, no swimming, nothing where it involved laps, or I could time myself. I felt like she had thrown me under the bus. Exercise has never been part of my ED, so I felt it really out of line and not helpful to say that. Mostly, I felt betrayed by her.\n* She changed my outpatient therapist without telling me in advance. I found out a couple weeks before leaving treatment when they were giving me my appointment times. I had been doing trauma therapy for two years with the same provider, and felt like if they wanted to change my therapist, I needed to know about it ahead of time and have time and the space in therapy to process the end of that relationship. My therapist wanted someone who specialized in eating disorders and thought my therapist should have forced me into treatment. The ED therapist she assigned me to was an hour drive from my home. I cancelled the appointment when I got home and called my old therapist back.\n\nThere is more, I know there is more, but that is all I can bring to the table right now. Are these types of dynamics what DBT is supposed to look like? Are all the coping tools so basic and ineffective? Was it not helpful because it's geared towards BPD and not PTSD? Or did I get a watered down version with a horrible therapist? I refuse to say she was a bad fit--I will continue to believe that she was a horrible therapist and would be a bad fit for anyone, even if I'm wrong.

465,JackStrawBerryfields,t5_s5o7i,"This past summer I was two pounds away from being my lowest weight ever. I wasn't healthy, but I liked how I looked (for the most part). I also didn't intentionally restrict hardcore to get there; I lived alone until the end of the summer, so it was easy to forget to eat if I wasn't hungry, and I was dealing with so much anxiety and depression that I wasn't often hungry. My parents and my bf expressed some concern, but for the most part, my weight loss went unnoticed (except for all the compliments I received, which is fucked up because I was very underweight...not knocking on death's door or anything, but I've been admitted at that weight before).\n\nFast forward to fall: I'm on a mental health leave of absence for work, and I naturally become more sedentary as I spent a lot of time at home and the weather got colder. I could tell I was gaining, but because I wore leggings 24/7, I didn't know how much.\n\nFast forward to winter: I go back to work, and on my first day back I tried wearing a pair of my ""fancy pants"" (that's how I refer to work pants lol) that fit just right...before. Luckily these pants are super stretchy, so I spent my entire first day back keenly aware of the waistband cutting into my stomach. Not long after this I went out and bought a scale (I smashed my last one before moving in with my bf this summer, when I didn't need a scale to tell me I was underweight). And when I got on it, my jaw dropped and I fucking lost my shit, because I had gained 20+ pounds since August. That's like, treatment-level weight gain. \n\nFast forward to two days ago: I am on another mental health leave from work, and I'm trying to find an outfit to wear to the funeral of one of my bf's family members. I grabbed a pair of black fancy pants that I haven't worn in god knows how long, because they were too big last spring/summer. And lo and behold, I couldn't zip them up. I tried really hard to keep it together for the sake of my bf, but I started sobbing about how fat I've gotten...he gave me a big hug, which helped, but I spent a good chunk of the day thinking about it, and at the visitation I barely ate anything, drank a bunch, and went home and drunkenly binged/ate my feelings.\n\nSorry this was a really long lead-up to the main point of this post...but basically, I have a closet full of clothes, many of which I haven't worn in a long time because of Covid and not working. I want to go through ALL of them and pull out what doesn't fit anymore, and clothes that I just wouldn't be comfortable in after gaining this much weight (when I had a flat stomach I was fine wearing form-fitting tops, but now hell no). The last time I had to do this was 5 years ago when I got out of residential treatment, so I already know the process is brutal. Does anyone have advice to make it less brutal?\n\nI'm planning on selling what I can on Poshmark because I only got to wear some of this shit once or twice (or not at all, thanks Covid).

This is when the urges began. \n\n\- Tried to distract myself by taking dog for a walk. Walked for 35 minutes. Success!\n\n\-Came back and decided to make myself a protein crunch wrap (it's basically flavored protein powder mixed with water, wrapped in a tortilla and popped into the oven to make a crunchy wrap). I'm a bodybuilder so I have all these protein food recipes I love. The wrap is only 270 calories, delicious and fits my macros so I don't feel to bad about it. \n\n\- Then I think to myself....ah, I really want something else. That wrap was only 270 calories. I have room for more (I don't). I make myself a vegan mug cake with greek yogurt frosting, strawberries and walden farms syrup.\n\n\- I'm definitely full after the mug cake. But I really want another mug cake. So I make one more with greek yogurt frosting and diced strawberries and syrup.\n\n\-After the second mug cake I'm stuffed. I force myself to go sit down and try and focus on a project I'm working on. But I want more food. I like eating while I'm working on projects. I get about three minutes into my project when I stand back up and walk into the kitchen, almost like in auto-pilot mode. \n\n\-I eat a few cashews from the jar. A bunch of pumpkin puree mixed wth pb2. I go sit back down.\n\n\-About ten minutes goes by and I'm feigning.

Then I think about how shitty I'll feel in the morning. Then I remind myself it's the last weekend I'm home alone. I get back up.\n\n\-I eat one of those jumbo flour tortillas - 310 calories each. I eat it slow, piece by piece, mesmerized by its texture. That shit is so fucking bomb. At this point I contemplate driving to the store to buy a box a cereal to binge on.

481,Jiggityjiggtyjang,t5_31ms0,"A few years ago, I woke up feeling extra shitty - **defeated, hopeless, sick to my stomach** \- from a particularly horrible evening of drinking. **I felt so out of control** with alcohol and my life.\n\nEvery morning I woke up terrified that I would drink, and every night I would drink, and drink way too much (because once I broke the seal, **I got the fuck its, numbed out, and went full hog**). **I was so sick of promising myself I would quit** drinking, only to break my promise and fail myself - over and over and over. I didn't believe myself at all, and my promises felt emptier and emptier with each passing day, which terrified me more and more because -- **if you can't trust the one and only mind and body you inhabit, then what CAN you trust? It's a scary place to be.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so sick of myself. I hated myself. And it's hard to feel motivated to change and improve for someone you don't respect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I wondered how the hell I got to that point. I reflected back on my life, and thought back to when I was just a little girl. I saw myself at about 7 years old, running around the park, playing in the sand, just being a kid with her entire life ahead of her. So much hope, so much to live for. What did she want in life? What were her hopes and dreams? Tears started streaming down my face, because even though I hated the person I was in that moment, I realized I still loved that little girl, and I still wanted to make her hopes and dreams come true. I couldn't do it for myself, but I could do it for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd right then and there, I sat up in bed, sobbing, and decided......**I'm going to do this. I'm going to do it for her.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I linked both my pinkies together, because that's what kids do...right? And I pinky promised myself that I would never, ever give up, that I would **keep trying something new, something different,** until I finally found something clicked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd for the first time in months, after all the empty promises, after losing faith in my own word, I actually believed myself. I realized....  maybe I can't promise myself that I'll stop drinking today, because that still feels so out of my control, but I can promise myself that **I will keep trying new things.** That I will not give up. Even if I fall back down, the promise can still hold true, because **it's not contingent on my success/failure,** only on my effort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I made that promise to myself, I meant it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDid I stop drinking that day? No. But **I started making real progress, started putting together new puzzle pieces, and I started having real faith that I was going to find something that stuck.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday, I am almost two years sober.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy am I writing about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I'm struggling with binge-eating now. And it's been painful. All those emotions I struggled with while I trying to quit drinking, the cycle, the relapses, the waking up hopeless and defeated, it's all back, only now it's with food.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut this time, I KNOW for CERTAIN that I will find something that clicks for me, that I will overcome this. Because I did it with alcohol. And I can do it with food. And so can you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. This is why we have to keep trying new things, because what works for one person won't work for the next.** We are all individuals with unique stories and motivations and backgrounds, so that is why we have to keep trudging forward, paying attention to every setback so we can learn for the next round.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So let's make a pact,** guys. Let's freaking do this. Maybe we'll binge again, maybe we won't. But what we CAN be certain of is that we'll get back up. We'll FACE what happened, so we can learn from it. We'll try something different, so we can figuring out new tools and strategies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**We're in this TOGETHER!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd every time we try something new, let's share it on here so we can keep helping each other out, and motivating each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWho's in? Pinky promise?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are a few new things I have been trying:\n\n1. I have been listening to a new podcast that has been really comforting. It's called ""Healing Emotional Eating"" by Janet D Thomas. Even though it's about emotional eating, it totally applies to binge-eating.\n2. I have been trying shift my focus from what I want, rather than on what I don't want. So instead of being like.."" I don't want to binge, I don't want to eat that, I don't want to do this, or that."" I am thinking ""I want to eat bomb, healthy foods that make me feel amazeballs, I'm a badass who is free from the chains of food, I want to wake up without bloat belly tomorrow, I want to go to bed feeling good."" I feel like focusing on what I don't want still gives it power and energy. I want to shift that energy and power to the things I want so I feel motivated to chase them. It also helps squash that ""voice"" that tells me to binge.\n3. Meditation. I have found some food freedom meditations on YouTube, and am trying them out in the mornings. I used to think meditation was so hokey, but I got so desperate when I was trying to quit drinking that I tried it - mainly because my brain felt so effed up I knew I needed some mental clarity. Well goddamn,....that shit actually helped A LOT!!!\n4. When I want to eat something when I'm not hungry, I play the video reel all the way through to the end. I think to myself....ok, so you eat the donut. Where are you going to be in five minutes? Exactly where you are right now, because it's not like the donut is going to be in your mouth forever (though that would be nice, wouldn't it, lol. Note to self: invent the eternal donut). You're going to be right back at square one, with no donut in your mouth, just like right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday is Day 2 for me, wish me luck!!!!

495,KB_Levi,t5_2zzq8,"Hey. \n\nSo I am 21/F, at age 13 I had bulimia and from there it went on for about a 1 and 1/2. At the time I was suffering with severe depression without knowing and I had never seeked any medical help up until I was 20. \n\nI thought in the past I was strong enough to overcome anything and back then people used to look at depression as something you could just get over and so I had the same mentality with my ED, I did well to stop myself from continuing to live that life but it caught up with me in ways I hadn't expected. \n\nGetting and drunk or being hungover and being sick, felt good but I knew it was bad to like it and it didn't kick in for a long while that I was enjoying it because it was the feeling of what it was like when I was bulimic. \n\nI decided 5 years ago that in diet change I wanted to go vegan, it was for the right reasons and I wasn't expecting it but I lost weight like it was nothing. I had bones showing out of skin and I hadn't ever seen them before and I was ecstatic about it. In 3 months I had lost 4 stone. Time went on however and now more and more vegan things are coming out which has meant more and more that things that where vegan have eventually become unhealthy again.\n\nI went on birth control, I was eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and It caught up with me and I was piling on the pounds. Safe to say I am still in that rut where I am at a weight I no longer desire again. I'll be honest and say I am still binging. It gets worse and worse to the point Im not sure if I'm even vegan anymore. \n\nMy mum makes all my meals and I'll sit there and wait till she goes on her late shift to then order myself some food, sometimes I get things with cheese on it. I cant tell you how many bags I have hiding in my room where it is all takeaways I'm trying to hide from my mum as I know she checks the bins to make sure I eat. \n\nMy mum not that long ago found out that I had a past ED, she doesn't know I'm currently in a different one. I don't think she fully understands it and I don't think she understands the toll it has on someone especially with depression playing into it. My brain doesn't work in ways that she can understand.\n\nThats why the other day, to me it was a big deal but to her it was nothing. My mum put me on a diet. I was there on sunday laying in bed wondering why I was still so hungry, naturally I waited for her to go on shift and ordered myself so much food and binged. \n\nI then had a shift at work and my mum told me she had made my food for the day, ""this is your 500 day"" she said. We had previously discussed about doing the 5:2 diet which essentially is on 2 days of the week you eat only 500 calories in the day, the rest of the week you can eat whatever you want. However, even though I said I'd be down to try it again (failed in the past) I didn't know it was going to be right away. \n\nSo when I was told that the day was my 500 day, i sarcastically (but also meant it) replied that it was nice of her to let me know I was starting my diet that day. Little did I know she then went on to tell me it wasn't my first day as she had put me on it on the sunday... hence why I was hungry and ordered food. \n\nIt was weird because anyone else I've spoken to about think my mum was just trying to be kind. But i know in my head that they also just don't get it. My head was in loops when I found out. I already didn't like myself from binging on the sunday and then to find out that should have been my 500 day made me more disgusted with myself because although it shouldn't be what I think, the first thought that came to my head was that I should have been starving myself that day. \n\nNot sure this is the best diet for me to be going on right now. Don't know if anyone else has had something like this happened to them but let me know how everything got on. I'm not doing well in general and I really want to stop binging but the moment I do I feel like I'm starving myself and I get aggy.",1629326809,I've been put on a diet without knowing.,"[0.04416632527188477, 0.1142754066281659, 0.0008191984312799141, 0.02387874186302358, 0.03805371535636915, 0.08891888231888097, 0.3437848025227756, 0.15185240837079872, 0.003249043802600304, 0.1910014754342211]"

I was 3 years clean before this relapse. \n\nThe only way I have ever stopped was to be completely free of carbs. I know it sounds counterintuitive, because it's restrictive.

I didn't over eat or binge, my body knew when I ate enough and it was never a too full or uncomfortable feeling. The urge to binge was gone completely and so was the urge to purge. I knew what I was doing was healthy for me and I felt proud of the food I was eating. \n\nMy hormones healed because I was eating healthy fats, so my period came back and my emotions became regulated.

I know the science behind eating low carb, and I knew I had to keep the food down or it wouldn't work. In order to become fat adapted you have to keep at least some high fat food in your system.

I've been taking a course (called Big Little Feelings...they also have an Instagram account, I think) about how to gently and supportively help a toddler through a tantrum and I just had the realization that I can do the exact same for myself through an ""ED tantrum "".\n\nThere's a lot of content in the course, but some tips I've gotten is:\n\n1.) Validate the feeling.  It's okay to feel the way you're feeling. No feelings are wrong or bad. In fact, it's healthy to feel your emotions, express them, and release them instead of squashing them down.\n\n2.) Set boundaries. Although there are no ""bad"" feelings, there are unacceptable behaviors. In a toddler, it may be hitting. In our case, it may be restricting. Hold that boundary in a compassionate, but always consistent way.\n\n3.) Tantrums are not to be punished. They are developmentally appropriate and normal. So are ED ""tantrums"" (ex: thoughts and ""backslides"" along the road to recovery). Tantrums require a response of compassion instead of punishment. \n\n4.) During a tantrum is not the time to teach a lesson. Our ""lizard brain"" is on overdrive at that moment and can't take in any lesson. Instead, just be there and hold space during the tantrum. Once it is over and things have calmed down, you can then talk about lessons learned. Same goes for ED recovery. While in the midst of a trigger, just support yourself through it. Later, when you're feeling calm, is the time to reflect on how to do things differently next time. \n\nI hope this helps others too♡",1618261592,Managing ED thoughts is like working through a toddler's tantrum,"[0.024260921940153057, 0.055708767952038336, 0.6035179567097032, 0.001889322194643483, 0.0011471113626692444, 0.0129020905932649, 0.25868522190201537, 0.003658155357258382, 0.023188919926607144, 0.015041532061646986]"

I hate myself because I know it makes them  sad but eating it gives me panic attacks. I used to weigh 20 pounds more. The other day me and my mom were looking at old pictures of me when I was only 14 pounds heavier (the picture was only of my face, not my body), and I went ""I can't believe you think I look pretty when I look like this"" and she said ""well you were fat there"" thinking I was much heavier then than I was.

My little sister and my mom are both extremely beautiful and get told it all the time. It feels awful knowing that both my siblings (brother and sister) have had relationships and had people crush on them when they're both younger than me and no one has ever found me attractive. Next week I turn 17 and I've had two breakdowns anticipating the food. My mom wants to get me a vegan cake but I told her not to because I don't know how many calories are in it. I've struggled with binging so I can't control myself around food if I'm not tracking it. and my grandma is coming so we all have to go to a restaurant and there's no restaurant that has vegan options and calories that my parents would agree to go to.

I went to the doctor yesterday  and he told me that I shouldn't lose anymore weight (I'm not underweight, I'm in the 30th percentile for my height and age) but how can I not when I still look like this?

She told me that I could count on her and that she would be there with me on my weight loss journey. \n\nSo after a few appointments there was one day I felt really sick and had a few episodes 🤢 on the day of our appointment. So I wrote her a message asking if instead of a regular face to face appointment, if she could use that booked time to read an email that I wrote opening up to her about my ED and telling my most deep secrets that not even my partner knows about, such as bulimia habits, how I hate myself, how depressed I am... \n\nI told her because I really needed help. I told her because I really did not wanted to give up on my self, I wrote to her that it was my last call for help. \n\nI felt comfortable (or naive) enough to after 4 appointments believe that we had a true connection. That she was kind to me because she really wanted to help me no matter what. \n\nTwo days after this email she replied that she received my email and she was going to reply it soon. \n\nThis was two weeks ago and Friday I decided to give another try, so I sent her a voice message asking her if she saw my email, that I understand that it was quite important to me, and if she do not would like to continue as my dietitian to let me know. I sent this last one crying. Apologising for being too much but thing were really hard for me. Still no reply. \n\nEven though I told her how bad I was, I desperate for help I was. \nI was calling for help. \nI thought I could ask for help. But no. \n\nThe worst part is that I can’t stop to overthink it, check my phone to see if she replied, check my email, check her social media, I’m becoming a stalker or something, the fact that she rejected help really messed with my mind, I think I’m getting crazy sometimes. \n\nThe truth is. Nobody gets it. People are as disgusted by it as us. Nobody is there to save us. I will never trust no one anymore. 😓",1628431887,SO SAD!

556,LilGidGid,t5_rbmui,"I've been attempting some form of quasi-recovery for about three weeks now, after kind of reaching the end of my thread around late December and breaking down somewhat. Basically I resolved that I would make an effort to try to eat more and incorporate more foods into my diet so I can start getting my life back, but only eating up to my sedentary maintenance calories and still making sure to log everything so I know I'm not overshooting or undershooting. It's been going ok-ish so far (I am currently stressing over scary unknown calories brought to me by an egg and bacon sandwich that I bought for lunch today as a stupid little ""treat"", that's for a seperate post tho) but it has brought some obsessive tendencies to do with exercise to the forefront. To give a bit of context, prior to my ""quasi-recovery era"" I made sure to fit in two bike rides a week and try to reach 10k steps a day. These bike rides would be at an average speed and started off lasting 50 minutes to an hour, though the last month of 2022 I started increasing it beyond that to trying to hit 1hour 30, with my speed also increasing as I've been pushing myself more and have more energy to expend. Since increasing my caloric intake I've also increased the number of times a week I workout on the bike up by 1x, so now my base goal is to get out 3x per week. \n\nThis doesn't seem bad per say, the issue is it still doesn't feel like enough to me. I keep reading fitness subs and comparing myself to people who workout more days a week with me, getting competitive with people who have higher a higher kph than me or go further distances and it fuels my ED thoughts and makes me feel so inadequate. What is ""enough""? How much exercise quantifies as ""enough"" to my ED brain? I don't know. It's not like I only workout to burn calories, I wouldn't be cycling if I didn't enjoy doing it but it kinda does feel like the disordered part of my brain has latched onto yet another area of my life that I can agonise over.  Not to mention there is still the very real fear that I'm not calculating calories correctly and that I'm only burning 0.5 calories every workout because of how much I've lurked on certain weight loss subs in the past that stress about that cute little factoid (you know the one, the ""most people overestimate exercise and underestimate intake"", easily gets a spot in the Top 10 Things That Encouraged My Developing ED). \n\nI don't know what I'm doing here by typing all this out, guess I wanted to simply vent and see if anyone else feels similarly or ever uses the diet/fitness subs on here to trigger themselves.",1673598498,"No matter how much exercise I do I feel like I'm never doing ""enough""","[0.0010587073533172163, 0.021778275593316788, 0.10797425513135135, 0.0010070284013130686, 0.05997450552400557, 0.40658837566408884, 0.25265054426325323, 0.03361014594683326, 0.00048731911844325846, 0.1148708430040775]"

558,Lilith_Kea,t5_2zzq8,"I've been suffering from mixed eating disorder (alternated anorexia and bulimia phases) since I was 13. My usual attitude is to eat too much and feel just a bit guilty about it, until I gain a certain weight and start throwing up and skipping some meals until I completely stop eating. This usually goes on until something big happens that makes it easier to ignore the fact that I'm repugnant and don't deserve eating. Usually, it's the start of a relationship or help from my loved one.\nIn the period before the quarantine my anorexia phases had become overwhelming. When I then started a new relationship with my bestfriend, whom I'd been in love with for a while but initially rejected because of personal complexes, I slowly started eating again.\nWe've been together for almost 5 months now, and I did have some mental breakdowns about my weight. The only thing preventing me from starvation is seeing how he suffers about it. It literally makes me want to be better for him. However, I think those short mental breakdowns were just punctures, because now I'm really falling back into anorexia. And the real problem is... this often comes with some kind of side effect, which completely shuts down my sentimental (sentimental only) sphere. So I start living relationships like I'm acting in a movie, without feeling it. Kisses, hugs, caresses, they all become a mechanical habit moved by no affection. If I think of my boyfriend now, he's a friend. My closest and dearest friend, like before we committed, but still just a friend. And even though I know this is probably just a phase, it paralyses me, because we've had this problem since the beginning - I didn't want a relationship with him despite feeling completely addicted to him, until I gave up my shields and let go, accepting his love. However, everytime I feel slightly less in love with him, the fear that I might have made the wrong choice by starting our relationship comes back. 'Cause, maybe I'm not really in love, maybe I just got carried away, maybe it was just a moment, maybe sex, habit and addiction is what keeps me with him, I don't know and I can't know... The only thing I know is I run away everytime I'm scared, and now I'm terrified by both the possibilities that he really is not meant for me as a partner, AND that I will run away in denial despite this (not) feeling being just a phase... I feel so trapped like I got myself into something I cannot handle and he makes me the most happy person in the world, but... sometimes I wonder if I really am in love with him, or if I just want him in my life so much that I accepted being together and lying to myself that I love him, just to hurt him no longer and lose him not.

Yeah, that clown is me.\n\nImagine my surprise when I somehow thought the concept of “fear foods” wasn’t something I dealt with anymore…yet when I went to try to eat [formerly safe/non-threatening/nutritious food] yesterday, an all-too-familiar panic gripped my heart, I froze, and I put it back because I just got too freaked out. I felt like I was a teen again. It was not cool. It was not expected. And it’s no one’s fault but my own.\n\nWhat else did I expect from purposely seeking out triggers? I know that’s a rhetorical question because while we all logically KNOW it’s harmful, or could be, at least, logic doesn’t matter one iota when the ED is apparently more present than you thought it’s been for years.\n\nMoral of the story: if you have to go on a medically restricted diet, tube feeds, or TPN for a non-ED reason, and you get used to receiving all nutrition via formula or the small selection of foods your doctor says you can eat, even so much as not overtly fearing the formula or the doctor-sanctioned foods, don’t let your guard down by assuming it means you’re fear food free. \n\nCould it happen? Yeah, anything’s possible. Is it likely to happen? IME, I have to say no, because when I was face to face with a food I’d not been able to try for years, and even though it’s a food society deems heathy and is actually a nutrient-dense whole food that used to be “safe” even as far as my ED goes (it legit has never before been a fear food for me), the fear hit hard and fast, with no warning, and my physical fight or flight response had me running out of the kitchen and shutting myself in the bedroom.\n\nAt which point I further panicked realizing I essentially triggered a relapse without realizing it. To clarify, I know that what I was doing was looking stuff up with stupid, and I know my ED was convincing me I’d be safe (ofc there was a subconscious level on which my ED brain hoped it would happen, but no, not *really*, because I know there’s nothing but hell down this road), only to yank the carpet out from under me, leaving me falling smack down on my face onto the  pavement that is relapse.\n\nYou can never be too careful in avoiding triggers, whether current triggers or any you’ve had in the past, because ED is insidious and will slip in any chance it’s given. And it’s really good at convincing us it needs more chances. (It doesn’t)\n\nDon’t be a 🤡 like I was if you can avoid it. Nearly 20 years into this crap and it’s exhausting.\n\nSending love, empathy, and virtual hugs to anyone who needs them (and who wants to accept them, I’m not forcing hugs on anyone).\n\n*I know this was a vent, and I’m sorry I’m not asking for anything specific as far as feedback goes, I just really, really needed to try to get this out to a forum where I’m anonymous, and hopefully won’t get judged too harshly, since we’re all fighting this ED monster in one form or another. Also, apologies for typos. I tried to proofread, but probably missed some. I’ll fix them later if I see them.*\n\n🤡🤡🤡🤡🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️",1626898466,"Who’s the 🤡 now?

At ER basically started not being able to stay “in it” and kept passing out every time I was trying to move. Super orthostatic and tachycardic every time I sat up from laying. That night they transferred me to a bigger hospital via ambulance, and i’ve been at that larger hospital ever since. I’m still orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia.\n\nThey know i’m anorexic, my husband and I told them this when I got admitted and they keep the whole time telling me to eat. However, I’ve gotten away with eating almost ZERO since being here. I’ve been seen by a dietitian every day since being here and each one has basically said “yeah, so you should try to eat. Okay bye.” I’ve been in contact with my ED therapist, when she heard about this she as well as my ED dietitian called up one of the hospital dietitians (I gave my permission) yesterday. After that, they came in yesterday evening and placed a feeding tube. So now i’ve been on a tube for almost 24 hours- yay me. However, they still haven’t really offered me any support and the hospital dietitian has only come in to be like “hows the tube feeling, are you nauseous, okay well also try to eat some”. BUT they haven’t given me like any instructions or guidance about how much food I should be eating while now also on the tube, and I still haven’t eaten any really at all of the hospital food. And no one seems to really give a rats ass. Then, on the flip side they are coming in every day pumping me full of magnesium and potassium and electrolytes because my labs are all wonky and I can barely walk without passing out.\n\nI mean part of me is happy they aren’t force feeding me solid foods too, but now that I have the tube i’m even more afraid to eat. I just can’t believe what little guidance or support there is, and there is absolutely zero therapeutic support. Just treating my medical symptoms and tubing me. It’s terrifying.\n\nNow on a different rant I guess… i’m 28 years old. Suffered from EDNOS from like 12 to 19, got really bad toward the end, ended up in IOP then inpatient then residential and was in recovery every since. Up until the last 6 months when I relapsed HARD into anorexia, lost a lot of weight and am now underweight according to my treatment team…. I’m 28, i’m married and have a great relationship, I have a dog I love, I have a college science degree, my life is pretty good. I am aware that other the past year some really stressful things happened in my life, like graduating college, struggling to find a job/purpose, but come on… I’m a grown ass adult. I never thought I would end up here. I’m actually about 10+ lbs lighter than I was last time I went into impatient as a 19 year old. My symptoms/behaviors are far worse this time around. I just never thought I would be here again.\n\nI love my husband, he’s the light of my life and we’ve been together for 11 years. He was with me when my ED got so bad before, and he also never thought we would be here again. Watching how i’ve hurt him and the guilt I am feeling is the hardest thing I’ve ever been through, and at the same time I’m almost so numb to it. Because if I let myself start to really feel that… well, I just start to crumble. The guilt is absolutely unbearable. Then I feel guilty for not really FEELING horrible about it, if that makes sense, because emotionally i’m so numb.\n\nI’m not sure what the plan is for me. My outpatient treatment team (doctor, therapist, dietitian, all ed specialists) have been trying to convince me to get into residential treatment and we were starting to work towards that before this hospital stuff happened. So now it looks like I might be going to this residential place (Rain Rock, Springfield OR) after I get discharged from here, but it seems like my doctor is not sure when that will be and just today was actually talking about maybe sending me to a different hospital with a heart specialist because they can’t get my tachycardia figured out…. so i’m floating and have no idea what tomorrow or the next week or my next steps will be.\n\nFUCK this turned into the longest post. Writing this out was good though, todays the first day i’ve had anything close to the type of energy needed to do so.\n\nIf anyone actually read- thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart.",1579654249,Currently in hospital.

It took so much courage to walk in there knowing that I was setting myself up for phrases like, ""Fasting would be good for you,"" and, ""do you understand that this is three times what you should weigh!?"" You're the only one new to this party doc.  But he did the tests and he didn't find anything, so with more condescension he sent me on my way.  What he didn't believe was that I was already only eating once a day.  What he didn't believe was that I already knew how hungry felt.  What he didn't believe was the effect his words would have on someone with a history of bulimia.  The shame came back almost immediately, while the habits crept back slowly but surely.  For a while it was just a couple of times a week, just when I finally got so hungry that I overate.  It got worse.  Eventually I was fully back to planning how I ate food strategically with enough liquid to make it easy to come back up, only eating late enough at night that I wouldn't have to worry about anyone noticing a pattern, unable to stand the idea of even a little bit of food in my stomach.  My mom convinced me to try a new doctor, one who didn't give up right away when he didn't initially find an answer. Turns out I have a thyroid related autoimmune disease, which makes sense, but he doesn't know which one, so he hasn't started treating me yet.

609,MissRiss918,t5_2zzq8,"Welp. The title really says it all. I have struggled with an eating disorder for 17 years now. I went to rehab (for what I promised to be the last time) Nov 15’-Mar 16’ and swore I would never look back. Unfortunately, I had some challenging health issues that made eating disorder recovery more complicated. After being completely weight restored and almost 6 months into recovery I began to lose weight due to a rare digestive disease. I was diagnosed at the Cleveland Clinic, and almost immediately received a feeding tube, which I had for a year and a half. During a second surgery to have a J tube placed, my surgeon discovered some twisted bowel, repaired it, and things got so much better! My digestive issues seemed to clear up, and I had my feeding tube removed last year. Eating was going remarkably well, and I was doing really well! I remained under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist for this entire time. \n\nWell, I am not exactly sure when things went wrong because denial obscured my vision. Things have definitely gone wrong though. I know for sure I have relapsed. I talk with my professionals about eating behaviors, but for so long I was adamant that any weight change or vomiting was due to my digestive disease. I can not deny clear behaviors any longer. \n\nNo matter what I do though, there seems to be a barrier to discussing this with my team. I know they are there to help, and I truly do not want to continue down the slippery road that relapse will lead to, but I am completely lost. I guess I am wondering if anyone else has been in the position of being fearful of discussing a relapse.

623,More-7712,t5_2zzq8,Hello everyone. I have been struggling with anorexia and disordered eating and I sometimes abuse laxatives after a binge to try to compensate and get all the binge calories out of my system as soon as possible. I realize this is dangerous and unhealthy and I really want to stop because I think all the misuse has caused me to get constipated whenever I do not take them. I actually have to take Miralax every day because it was prescribed to me by my doctor for previous chronic constipation and my prescription is 8g/day as per my doctors recommendation. When I abuse the laxatives I will typically take 68g Miralax and 32mg Senna (the recommended dose is 8mg and the Senna was not prescribed to me) after a binge. I only take the Senokot after a binge and I will gradually taper down the Miralax in the days following a binge until my next binge happens and the cycle restarts again. I realize this is way too high of a laxative dosage and that is why I want to stop misusing as soon as possible. I am currently five days since my last binge and I am currently taking 16g/day Miralax and feeling like I have constipation now which is only making it harder to try to recover and have normal eating patterns. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to stop abusing laxatives without developing constipation.

665,No_Sun_5176,t5_s5o7i,I stopped getting my period several months ago (last one in late May) while restricting pretty heavily. I am no longer restricting and have been eating at maintenance or slightly above for the last month (BMI 19). My period still hasn’t come back so I spoke to my doctor about it. I didn’t specifically mention ED stuff but explained I’d lost a large amount of weight quite suddenly and thought that was the reason for losing my period. My doctor said it probably wasn’t the reason as you only lose your period generally at a BMI of &lt;18. However they can’t do any tests or help me further until I’ve missed 6 months consecutive periods (this is the NHS in the UK). Now I am worrying that I have PCOS as my skin has been really bad lately and obviously that’s anxiety inducing as one of the main symptoms is weight gain! Is the doctor correct that period loss from sudden weight loss only really happens if you’re underweight?

698,Ok-Transition305,t5_o3plh,"TW: mentions of diets, eating behaviours, swearing.\n\nSo I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to “help” me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn’t even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don’t know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don’t think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in “safer” and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: “yeah well most people don’t know how to respond to eating disorders” / “they were just trying to help” and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn’t even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification. \n\nI often read on the internet that ‘diet culture is everywhere’ and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn’t even “EAT THAT MUCH” is NOT the right answer either. \n\nSociety and media have made it ‘normal’ and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one’s food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one’s self to look like someone they are not. \n\nWell, I don’t know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I’ll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‘INTERMITTENT FASTING’ (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL. \n\nYou wanna know what’s normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‘HEALTHY’. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively. \n\nYour body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don’t you think it’s much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.\n\nAnd for all those people who thought they were helping but were just reflecting back my insecurities and diet culture: FUCK YOU. Fuck you. Fuck you.

In uni I was a lot less active, ate more to help ease stress, and actually broke into an acceptable weight where my doc was happy.\n\nComing out of uni finally weighing a normal amount I was able to get active and feel strong. I remember actually being one of the stronger people in my friend group. It felt amazing, but my father had lost a ton of weight and as he got back in touch with me after not speaking to me for years, he would not shut up about my ""unhealthy diet"".\n\nThere were so many nasty comments that I never identified as damaging, I thought I was old enough to let them roll off my shoulders, but I think from a young age I was susceptible to anorexia. He instilled a sense of worthlessness in me, and explained his justification for cheating on my mom and leaving her was because she got ""fat"" (this was news to me, I never knew my mom was ""fat"").\n\nPretty soon I developed an obsession with walking and step counts. I fasted for days and lived off water, but still pushed myself to get my steps in. I lost weight so fast my doctor had me do bloodwork and a colonoscopy but nothing showed up, other than my extremely low blood sugar.

He already has a job in our new city and is working remotely until we move (assuming the COVID-19 vaccine allows offices to open again by the fall). I am working a temporary government job in our current city and want to transition into the private sector, so the move comes at the right time for me.

715,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,t5_o3plh,"I think some people are just need to be a higher weight than others to be healthy. No I dont meant it's bc they have more muscle, they have larger bones, bla bla. I meant they literally need to be fatter, they literally need to be a higher bf%, to be healthy. I dont care anymore if some 15 year old named suzie think that's fat logic.   \n \n\nA little backstory- in puberty, i was always the teen version of a lower but healthy bmi (teenagers dont use bmi, they use percentile, but you get what i mean). I was always in the ""acceptable"" range at school physicals. I never tripped any alarms. I was as skinny as most other students. But I was the one who, in order to maintain that weight, was passing out twice a month, not them. I was the one having a snack as my lunch, skipping my periods here and there, failing to grow in height or chest size. Not them.   \n \n\nIt doesn't help that my sister in her teenage years could be literally off-the-charts underweight and still show no signs of disordered eating, still have a fully functional life, never pass out, no medical issues, always getting her period, etc. My mom loved talking about how she was a similar weight as a teenager, and spoke of my sister taking after her like a point of pride.   \n \n\nI felt like even more of a failure bc I have very tiny bones and almost no muscle so I never felt like I could blame bone or muscle for my failure to be naturally skinny.   \n \n\nAnyway, very unsurprisingly, I eventually lapsed into a full-blown ED. When I hit my LW, I started mysteriously gaining on very few cals a day. I had triggered FHA. Even my endo noted that it was an uncommon condition. I once again compared myself- why could so many people be so much skinnier without triggering FHA? I actually lost weight very slowly and relatively little of it, so why me?   \n \n\nI started weight restoration. I was partially weight restored when I stopped that in its tracks. I had reached a bmi that most young people here have. But it just wasn't meant to be. I still needed to constantly use ED behaviours to maintain that weight. I was still mentally a wreck and obsessed with food. I felt like a crazy person stuck in a normal person's body, which felt more confusing than a crazy person stuck in an anorexic body.   \n \n\nYesterday, I had a realization- if I needed to constantly pass out and stunt my own growth to be normal-slim as a teenager, maybe it just isnt meant to be.   \n \n\nIt helps me to think of being naturally skinny like being naturally good at basketball. Some people are just not meant for it. It makes no sense for a 5 foot tall person to aim for the NBA and be constantly envious of natural talents.   \n \n\nToday I stopped all ED habits. I just ate intuitively. I know I will gain weight but I'm reminding myself of the basketball analogy. I feel bad when I see so many naturally skinny people on the streets and know I can't be one of them, but I remind myself that I am good at other things.

I get around when it comes to sex, mostly from artsy guys/girls from tinder and some just fwb who get off to emotional train wrecks like myself.

Despite being bulimic for over 11 years, I thought that pregnancy “cured” my bulimia. Fast forward to now, 3 weeks postpartum, and I’ve relapsed so bad. I’m back to binging and purging daily. I promised myself I would try to eat the recommended 1500-1800 calories a day while breastfeeding, but I’m struggling to keep down more than 700-800. Going up to 1000 calories still terrifies me. \n\nBefore I got pregnant, I was binging and purging daily and restricting to only 100-300 calories a day, plus abusing laxatives and taking 5-10 pills daily. This went on for over a year straight and I lost a ton of weight. This became normal to me. I still worked and functioned fine on those few calories. I know that with breastfeeding, you need to take in 500 calories more than you already do. That’s extremely hard for me. I consider 500 calories a binge that needs to be purged… \n\nI’m worried that in some way, I’m hurting my baby. I worry that my breast milk isn’t going to be sufficient enough for her in the long run. Right now, she is still gaining weight and pooping lots, which means she is eating enough, but I’m more worried about how the quality of my milk will be a while from now. I feel like I’m back in the thick of my bulimia so I know it’s going to take a while to “recover”, if I ever do.\n\nI guess the reason I made this post is to ask if anyone else is struggling with bulimia while breastfeeding. I feel so much guilt already. I do plan on seeking out help once I feel mentally ready, but any kind of reassurance is all I need right now. I just want to know if I’m hurting my baby in any way by purging. I know 800 calories a day isn’t sufficient while breastfeeding but I am trying so hard. Is anyone else going through this right now? I feel completely alone and isolated because I have no one to talk to. Everyone is complimenting my weight loss too which is just encouraging me even more.

One is called : Goals, where I write down my mental goals (example : eating without feeling guilty, respding to my cravings etc.).

Or didn't feel guilty for doing so, or skipping work outs simply because I don't feel like it. This gives me motivation to keep feeling the board and not abandone my progress. It changes the narrative from ""if I eat x thing will it slow down my progress physically?"" to ""eating this will help me over come my fears, thus helping me accomplish my mental goals"". Every time I think about skipping a meal or not responding to a craving a take a look at my board and say ""look at how far I have come, it would be a pity if I cancelled all my hard work like that"".

834,Quiet-Possible-732,t5_o3plh,"This time last year I was enveloped in an ED. I was working, but not mentally present. All I had energy for was laying in bed on my phone. I cut myself off my loved ones. I gave up my hobbies. I quit university. Of course there were the physical health issues too. Eventually I became so depressed that the only reason I had for not killing myself was because I wasn't skinny enough yet. \n\nFollowing an inpatient stay, a hospital stay, some gained trauma, some panic attacks, health issues, suicidal ideations, a handful of complete nervous breakdowns, gallons of chocolate flavored liquefied ass (If any of y'all have been IP, you know what I mean), months of depression and anxiety, a relapse, some more months of depression and anxiety...\n\nI stand (or type heh) before you as someone who beat anorexia. I'm now in university again, working, learning a new language, doing yoga, and gradually learning to love myself. And I sincerely enjoy eating again. Yeah, I'm still learning the ropes around intuitive eating, and yeah, there is still that fear in the back of my head that I'll gain weight if I eat normally, but I know how to combat that now, and that fear gets quieter every day.\n\nMy biggest fear is that my mental illnesses will return. But the good news is that even if they do, I feel so much more capable of handling them. I look back on where I was last year and think, ""Wow, I really am one tenacious motherfucker.""\n\nI'm not trying to flaunt my successes. I just wanted to let you know that it does get better and recovery is 100% possible for you. Life goes on, and it is so much more beautiful without an ED in it. I am a living example of that. I thought I'd include some tips that got me to where I am today too, hopefully they'll help someone. \n\n1) Laugh through the pain.\n\nHumor is a great coping skill. There's humor even in the horrible stuff, and trust me, finding the humor in the tough stuff will make it easier to handle by taking away some of its power in your head. Example: If you don't know this already: you get hella constipated in recovery. Like, HELLA. Your body has no idea what to do with food cuz it's a chump and forgot. In treatment, if you don't shit within a few days they give you mag citrate. And if that doesn't work, an enema. And then you wait. There are two brown liquids in recovery. One is gross, chocolate, high-calorie protein drinks. You can guess what the other is. There were a lot of times everyone would be at dinner or chilling and someone would suddenly be like ""I GOTTA GO OH FUCK"" and book their ass over to the bathroom. On the one hand, super embarrassing. On the other, it was hilarious because pretty much everyone went through it. Shit was common talk among my recovery friends. Moral of the story: There is humor in almost everything, friends. Lean into it to cope.\n\n2) Rely on your support system.\n\nOne of the stupidest parts about eating disorders is how unavailable treatment is for a lot of people. Treatment is expensive, and your insurance won't always cover it--if you can even afford insurance at all. I was incredibly lucky to be able to get so much help. But if you can't, you're gonna need people. I had to build up my relationships with my loved ones when I decided to recover. And I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have them. It can be hard for people to understand the hell that is an eating disorder, but if they're good friends or family members then they'll try to understand. If you truly feel like you don't have anyone in your life you can rely on, then step one is to start seeking out those relationships however you can. Step two is get on the Internet while you're crafting those relationships. Reddit is full of understanding humans who have great advice and can offer support. Be open to letting people help.\n\n3) If all you can do is exist for a while, that's okay.\n\nNot gonna lie, it really was all I could do to exist for a hot minute there. Every day was anixety-inducing and overwhelming and depressing. So I stopped trying so hard and did the bare minimum until I had a little more energy to do just a little more, and I built up from there. Yeah, it's important to push yourself, but when you're trying to recover from an eating disorder or depression, it's okay to just focus on eating, sleeping, and shitting for a while. Not forever, but for a while. You don't have to do it all today.\n\n4) Accept that you're a tenacious motherfucker whether you like it or not.\n\nDetemined! Persistent! Never gives up! Refuses to be destroyed! All of the above mean tenacious. And wow, are humans tenacious. We're incredibly adaptable, living in almost every type of environment throughout history. If you embrace this part of your literal DNA, you'll start realizing you can adapt to more than you think. Including the life you want that no longer features an ED.\n\n5) Delete your public social media.\n\nStop messing around. There is so much freaking research about how social media has a negative effect on mental health. Bruh. It ain't worth it. For me personally, I have an anonymous IG that I use *only* to follow positive self-help accounts and to communicate with my bff because she doesn't have a cell phone right now. Maybe one day I'll start using it again, but sure as hell not when my pain around comparison and shame is so fresh. If you're seriously trying to recover, social media is only going to make it harder. (Side note: Reddit doesn't count in my book, because almost all of it is anonymous.) \n\n6) Swear a lot.\n\nIt's so fucking cathartic, man. Swear at diet culture. (Kiss my ass, Chloe Ting Challenges."" (Mind you, not Chloe Ting herself, she seems like a wonderful person. But her videos aren't for you, bruh.)) Cuss out the plate before you. (""You think you're tough, bitch? You're nothing but a dick-sucking ham sandwich."") Cuss at your therapist even. (""The fuck? Why would I ever even consider family therapy?"") You are entitled to be angry about your situation. ED recovery sucks, and you didn't ask for this. Swearing releases the tension, at least for me. And it makes me laugh lol.\n\n7) Don't pretend 'it never happened.'\n\nThis is for later on in recovery, but something I tried doing after I was more confident in my abilities was being like, ""Eating disorder? What's an eating disorder? Never heard of her"" for a while. It didn't work. You can't erase trauma. If you pretend it didn't happen, all you are doing is setting yourself up for more triggering situations. Be openminded to the fact that you've been through a very hard thing, and though it isn't part of your narrative now, it *was* undeniably a chapter in your life. You and I both have to make peace with that.\n\n8) Maybe there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe *you're* the light. \n\nThis isn't really a tip, but it's a comment I saw somewhere (I don't recall the username, otherwise I'd give them credit) that really slapped me once across the cheek then again on the other. Full disclosure: I don't fully respect myself. I don't fully love myself. (But I don't HATE myself anymore. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm like, ""damn who is she"" and other times, even in the same day, I'll be like, ""who is that nasty-ass upright ape."" I digress.) You are the light. No one is going to save you but yourself. Even if you can't see it right now, you're glowing, bitch.\n\n9) Realize nothing is permanent. \n\nIt's the tacky quote hanging above your aunt's toilet. And I love it. If I've learned anything through my *cough* several mental-illness-related breakdowns, it's that emotions don't last forever. And more than that, life itself doesn't last forever. I know this isn't a thought that's comforting when you're in the beginning of recovery, but later on you'll be like, ""Why the hell would I diET and never let myself eat sushi when I have less than 100 years to live and I freaking love sushi? I'll take the goddamn rainbow roll, sir."" But if you're still in the thick of it, just keep reminding yourself that you're a tenacious motherfucker who lives in a world where things like cats and airplanes and Avatar: The Last Airbender and young Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic exist, and one day those things might be more important to you than an ED if you keep going.\n\nJust some things that have helped me. Thanks for reading. Today I am deleting this sub from my favorited list, because I find I no longer need to come here.

Correlation ≠ causation though, and i want to validate you all who may be binging for reasonss outside of a restricted food intake.*\n\nBinging isnt always caused by restriction, and we need to talk about it! \n\nConstantly, I am received with answers of ""eat more!"" ~~I am eating more, and at this point actively gaining.~~ \n\nWith an eating disorder, I think we are all fully aware of when we eat enough, and when we do not. Lately, I have been eating ""enough."" In the past when I struggled with binge eating, I was eating enough ~~I was eating *more* than enough, actually. Childhood trauma fucks you up.~~. \n\nAnd if this is you, you may wonder why you still binge. \n\nYou most likely don't have BED. **THE BINGE RESTRICT CYCLE DOESN'T ALWAYS STEM FROM THE RESTRICTION.** If you have a restrictive ED &amp; are actively restricting though, it most likely does *play a part* in those binges. \n\nHowever you *can* [also] be someone who uses food to aide in other things. And this isn't always a bad thing - when balanced with other coping skills. \n\nHere are some reasons you may be binging:\n- self sabotage \n- ADHD/underestimation\n- happiness chasing\n- emotional regulation\n- self beliefs\n- addiction(s)\n- habit\n- unsatisfied with something *not* regarding food\n- childhood habits\n- anxiety \n- excitement or rewarding\n- AND restriction!

Too sick to attend whatever is giving me anxiety, sickness as a punishment, &gt;!throwing up due to an upset stomach!&lt; and spending the rest of the next day in pain. \n\nThat's not to say restriction isn't the cause sometimes (it oftentimes is and can be). But for many, it may not be the direct cause at all! \n\nStill, restriction is a shitty coping skill too.

Treating yourself to food is fine. If using a skill on occasion keeps you safe, that is the more important outcome. \n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is check yourself, don't judge yourself, and be open with yourself about why you think you're binging.

I was talking to her today about how stressed out I am concerning the fact I didn't lose enough weight in time for my birthday today and she said something she said months ago ""It's not about your weight it's about your health"". I then explained that I'm trying to get back to my old set-point weight and she told me that its an admirable goal but as I get older and the longer I live in North America that weight will be a little higher than it was and I should really be aiming for about &gt;!10 lbs!&lt; above that.

884,Sarshli,t5_o3plh,"Hey, so sorry for posting so much in so few days. I'm pretty new to this whole ""social media"" thing and it's quite exciting to finally connect to other people.\n\nI'll finally be going to a Maudsley-based specialist centre on... someday. My family and I are going to get me tested and see if we can get a diagnosis, and finally start treatment proper. The issue is that thanks to Covid-19 (and my poor phone-handling skills) we have absolutely no idea when we'll be able to get me tested and diagnosed for possible anorexia or any other ED.\n\nThis is an issue for me because Compulsion (Compulsion is the name I've chosen to give my eating-disordered thoughts to try and separate them from my ""me"" thoughts) is telling me to restrict my food intake for these upcoming days. It's saying things such as ""what if you become weight-restored and reach a BMI of 18.5 before your test, and the doctor sends you home with no diagnosis"" and ""you gained x amount of weight over x amount of days when you ate unrestricted, if you keep eating like you did back then, you'll be back to normal before your appointment"" ""you weren't restricting for that long, you don't have enough of the physical symptoms to be actually diagnosed with anorexic) and such and such nonsense.\n\nI do genuinely desire treatment, and I feel Maudsley would be particularly helpful for me. I feel even though I've gained weight since the beginning of the refeeding process (a large amount of it may be water weight- seriously, some of the numbers are absurd!) my psychological healing is going slowly. My family offers me a lot of wiggle room in terms of what and when I eat (breakfast nowadays is entirely unsupervised- if I wanted, I could probably skip it and no one would know... but I won't.) in addition to allowing for exercise. Even though I want to ask for them to tighten the cord, I know that my parents believe in a more hands-off approach and for me to sort it out myself. Hence why I'm afraid of ""missing out"" on treatment due to my climbing weight.\n\nI'm deathly afraid of this causing another relapse. My previous relapse wasn't serious, but I would still rather go through with a steady recovery than constantly put my body through guessing games of ""is she actually eating, or is this another fluke?"" not to mention my mother's heartbroken look when she saw that the scale hadn't budged in a week. I almost feel compelled to weigh myself to see how I've done eating decently normally these past few days, but I'm choosing not to because I know it can't lead to anything except for strengthening compulsion.\n\nIt simply feels so... *easy* to starve. I won't list any specifics here, but due to my parents' hands-off approach to my refeeding, it's alarmingly easy for me to shave off entire meals worth of food at practically every opportunity. The more I think about it, the more enticing it becomes. I feel like I am going mad. Every day, it gets a little bit more difficult to do this constant finicking dance with Compulsion, trying to distinguish newly-arisen rules it sets and dealing with the constant guilt and shame of the simple act of eating. Nowhere, not even my own mind, is a safe place for me to stay.\n\nI don't want to relapse again. I really, truly don't. Relapses are miserable, cold, tired and filled with nothing but paranoia. But this time, Compulsion's voice is followed by a genuine and legitimate concern- is it worth pushing forward with my physical recovery if it means I may not be able to get the psychological help I need/want? Is it worth risking not having access to a treatment team due to gaining weight? I feel rife with uncertainty- and Compulsion thrives on uncertainty. because it will always tell me to choose the easiest option. Which is, as always, ""don't eat"".

885,Sarshli,t5_o3plh,"Hi, just to clarify, I'm someone who hasn't gotten diagnosed with anorexia medically due to COVID-19. But based on the fact that thinking about eating a banana makes me feel like someone is slowly strangling me whilst also ripping out my organs, I'm going to reckon there's at least something going wrong with my eating habits. Sorry for the long post, scroll to the last two paragraphs to skip all the set-up.\n\nI heavily restricted my food intake for a relatively short time. However, during that time, my weight dropped significantly, and definitely not through healthy means. I'd always been on the lower end of bmi even beforehand, and dropping all that extra weight really took a toll on my physical state. My family (I live with two parents and an older sibling) and I have been working for me to put some weight back on. I haven't weighed myself in a while since the last weighing sent me whirring into restriction, but at least I know I'm gaining weight just by checking my ribs and thighs.\n\nMy issue is that my mental hunger is incredibly confusing to me. I'd eat a meal that would otherwise be incredibly satisfying- including all of my favourite foods, eating without guilt or worry, all three macronutrients- but then I'd still be thinking about food. Funny thing, I don't even fantasize about any specific food. It almost feels like novelty-food-thinking to me- my thoughts are all about McDonald's burgers (I've only ever had their junior chicken) cherries (we have a huge bag of them and I haven't sat down with a bowl full and eaten yet) kraft dinner mac'n'cheese (the last time my friend made some he overcooked the macaroni and it was very soft) my father's cooking (everyone needs more stir-fries in their life). It doesn't feel like I want to eat them as much as it is I'm asking myself what options there are for me to eat. And then opting to not eat any of them, because thinking about sitting down with them and eating them feels more like a chore than anything. Sort of like when you served yourself a spoonful or two too much pasta sauce, and now you're sitting there thinking ""I don't really want to finish this because I'm happy with what I've just eaten, but I have to anyway"".\n\nI've heard that this might be because your brain hasn't yet caught up to your body in terms of satiation and that sitting with it helps, so I sat with it. The mental hunger (for me, mental hunger means being unable to focus on anything else except for food and whether or not I should eat) did not go away. I don't know if I'm just bored, or what- but nothing seems to be able to take my mind off of the idea of eating.\n\nObviously, the answer to this is to just eat. Any answer that sounds like ""don't eat"" is the disorder, or at least I'm told. Even then, I feel wrong somehow. I'm obviously not as underweight or malnourished as many other sufferers since I restricted for such a short time span, and for all I care, my body is functioning mostly like normal now. I don't feel cold or tired anymore, and other than my period still taking its sweet time to rear its ugly, bloody head, everything else works.\n\nAnd yet I have such a larger appetite than anyone else in my family. No amount of food feels like enough. I could eat an entire three-course meal one hour and I'd feel ready for another one the next. It's like I'm feeding my body all that it's asking from me but I just can't keep up. Like all the food I'm hurtling down my mouth is getting ground up into paste somewhere in my gut and all that comes out on the other end is strongly-smelling gas and signals for more food. What's more, I don't enjoy eating when I'm like this. Surprisingly, eating when you're physically satiated makes food pretty unexciting, even if it's cookies and ice cream. \n\nNo amount of eating seems to make this mental hunger go away. Every moment of the day I'm either eating or waiting until my stomach feels ready to eat again. Nothing makes the hunger shut its trap and leave me alone. Moreover, I'm fairly certain that I don't *need* all this food. I try not to count calories in case it launches me back into relapse- but if *this* much food isn't enough to satiate someone of my age and build, then I have no bloody idea how anyone in this world sustains a reasonable budget for groceries. \n\nI've heard that I should cut back on fruits and vegetables during this time since they fill your stomach without offering an awful lot of energy, but I haven't committed to this rule because my stomach so far has been able to at least handle the amount of food I throw at it, and I'm definitely gaining weight on it. With that being said, I've only been able to put on this weight while including treats such as ice cream and chocolate as a part of my regular diet as if it were its own food group, and I must say, the taste of sugar is getting a touch old. It doesn't feel like *I* want the food, it feels more like some higher power is telling me to get the food, and filling my mind up with thoughts of ""man. food is great"" if I don't comply. So I end up in a position where I'm thinking about food and thinking about eating, but the idea of getting more food and eating sounds... boring. And annoying. And a bother. Any idea for foods that I could eat get shot down by that ""no, I'm satisfied"" feeling you get after a good meal, where you know you're full and nothing sounds appealing... but satisfied people don't fantasize about food, do they?\n\nLong story short, I'm plagued by constant ""mental hunger"" of obsessive, cyclical thoughts about food and what I want to eat, but no food seems appealing- not even the low-energy ""diet"" foods my disorder loves, and not the high energy treat foods that my underweight body loves, either. I feel simultaneously satisfied and unfulfilled. I don't feel uncomfortable or bloated, just... happy with the food that I've eaten. I try to answer this by telling myself to eat more, but I'm afraid I'll overeat without my body asking for the food (maybe I just get obsessed about things easily, including food?) and that'll somehow end up going badly.\n\nI've considered that maybe the fear of overeating or eating without hunger is my disorder playing its tricks on me, but I'd like to hear some outside opinions. I'd like to reiterate that I'm not terribly underweight or malnourished, and that I'm approaching the good'ol 18.5 BMI benchmark without much issue. My set point is a bit above that, but I'm hoping that these endless food thoughts will have tapered off by the time I approach that point.

I was almost 300 lbs, active but not like, *active,* and had been raised in diet culture with a lovely side of emotional eating per family culture. You can imagine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I was doing pretty well. I followed the guidelines, switching white for whole wheat, lots of fruit rather than heavy meals, no fast food. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy well-meaning friend criticized me for using one yolk in otherwise egg-white omelettes each morning. I told her that I needed the yolk because otherwise egg whites completely stick to the pan and it's a mess. ""No, you're just messing it up,"" she insisted. And because I respected her opinion, I felt bad, and wrong, and gave in to that sense of failure I had grown up with trying to fight an eating disorder in the context of having no other coping skills and a family environment that supported my disorder. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you could tell me I was weak. Geez, u/Sojournancy, you just gave up?! \n\nYou wouldn't recognize from that little story how much it cost me to make those changes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to step outside myself, my routine, my relationships, all the current and past problems I was already dealing with to take a hard look at what I was, where I was going, the consequences of continuing without change.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Everything I had assumed to be true was no longer a given, I had to examine everything. Every meal, every nutrition fact, every moment of my life where I was sitting rather than moving or eating rather than being active. It was exhausting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to find answers to questions that dieticians and physicians and environmentalists still argue about - what was good versus what was right, and all the dissenting opinions that still exist today because of the inherent flaws and politicization of nutrition research.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to stop believing what my closest allies had told me about food for my whole life, and find another group of people that believed that the new way of eating was the ultimate truth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to get over the shame and guilt of having gotten to that state, learn how I got there, and most importantly, move past blaming anyone in order to put that energy toward recovery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to sacrifice the ease of social gatherings to make harder decisions about avoiding stuffing myself with food that would have previously been something I didn't think twice about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-I had to make time in my busy schedule to do this research, prepare meals for myself and my partner, and above all, learn about nutrition. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA decade later, I still hear her voice in my head, discouraging me despite all the effort I had made, saying that something I was trying that was working so far was not good enough, so I was bound to fail. The funnier part was that only a short time after that, it was all over the news that ""EGGS GOOD!"" so perhaps I was right anyway? Doesn't matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's the discouragement that hurts. This is what people read when they come on this forum to talk about what is working for them and other people respond by saying it'll never work, 'diet-culture', you're wrong, you'll screw up, you'll relapse, it's bad for you, and whatever other well-meaning but hurtful advice you want to give because the post triggered you.  \n\n\nIt takes an incredible amount of energy to make significant changes in one's habits, coping skills, and routines. Sometimes it means ending relationships and being alone, leaving us seeking community elsewhere. It requires putting oneself in the driver's seat, at the top of the priority list, when doing that isn't always possible with the number of responsibilities we all have.   \n\n\nSome of us making these changes are already running on fumes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSure, Keto, Low-carb, high-carb, WW, intuitive eating, mindful eating, vegetarian, vegan, high-fat, all meat, all of those diets may not have worked for you, and if I had to bet, all diets will eventually putter out at some point, because LIFE HAPPENS. Anyone that can focus on meal prep and calorie counting and label reading when they've just had a miscarriage or lost their job or have a bank payment bounce on them is postponing or bottling up some feelings that will eventually catch up to them.  That's life. Stuff happens. Sometimes the amount of energy we put into managing what we eat comes at too high a cost and we have to let go for awhile.   \n\n\nBut that's okay. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the heart of it, we are all better off digging deep to find out why binge-eating is a symptom of something we are trying desperately to suppress. Whether it's trauma, unresolved grief, insecurity, shame, fear of abandonment, malnutrition, hormonal imbalances - binge eating happens for many different reasons. Restricting is a trigger for some, and a medicine for others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf people that come into this forum feel a sense of safety and security by using any certain way of eating or plan, I call upon you guys to be supportive, open, and kind. The purpose of coming here is to manage binges. If a diet, even temporarily, helps to manage those binges so that people can get better physically or psychologically, that's still a plus. It's still an experience that can benefit them temporarily, and if it stops being effective, they move on. Those people, you included, need to know that if and/or when you come back here and say ""dammit, it didn't work,"" you'll be met with ""that sucks,"" ""you tried so hard!"" ""we have your back!"" ""it's just a setback, don't forget what you accomplished,"" and all things good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe need to be a community that respects and gives warmth to people that are TRYING. \n\n.\n\nPeople that are STRUGGLING need validation and support.\n\n.\n\nPeople that are TRYING have hope - don't snuff it out. \n\n.\n\nPeople that have lost hope in one technique have a hundred others yet to try - encourage them on the next step of their journey.\n\n.\n\nSome parting words. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Please report comments or posts that violate our rules, make you feel unsafe, or openly PROMOTE actual unsafe practices.

Last year I gained a lot of weight, and in January I decided to lose that weight, thinking I would do it ""healthy"" this time. I think it took me 2 days to completely fall back into my old behaviors, however, being more restrictive this time around. I was already under a lot of stress and I had already lost a bunch of weight when corona came waltzing around in march, and my grandfather who I grew up with passed away in april. I have now gotten to a point where I am underweight, and feel like my body is extremely tired. It has been months since I've been able to keep a meal down even if its not a binge. My ed has been the worst it has been in years but I think I'm finally tired of this, and ready to get this out of my life for once and for all and give this up. I'm tired of having a sore throat and gums all the time, I'm tired of lying to everyone, and I'm tired of being so consumed by this.\n\nI am just so scared that if I give up purging, the weight will just pile back on.

I was bigger, but not fat in track and field, so I wanted to lean out for the next season and the coronavirus was happening so I realized that I could use that time to lose some weight. And I did. I was eating very little calories for an extended period of time, I lost about 30ish(175-178 ish to 147-151)or more pounds from mid March to August 2020. \n\nThe difference: [https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH](https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH)\n\nMy knees became knobby, I looked really really skinny. I was always hungry, I didn't care about anything other than nutrition and I didn't even talk to any of my friends. I noticed that I didn't have any urge to masturbate or talk to girls, which wasn't rly a problem to me at the time because of corona. I noticed my facial hair under my chin didn't grow at all until a few months ago. I was kinda cold and had night sweats. I was Eating about like 1800 to 2300 max while in pre-season track and field took a hit on my body and my hamstring pulled, causing me to not compete at my best ability. By march 2021, I started reverse dieting and gradually reached 3200 calories by mid April(which still wasn't enough for a teen athlete). When we went back to school, I started interacting with other students and realized my personality completely changed. I felt like I was under them(which is ironic because before I felt I was the guy subconsciously). I had more social anxiety, my voice got lighter, and didn't have the flow of conversation anymore. That's when I realized I did something really wrong, which lead me to think I dramatically decreased my test levels. I started looking up the importance of fats in a diet and how low calorie diets lead to low testosterone and GH, and that broke me. I always wanted to develop and grow into a man and I was finally getting there before losing weight and dieting. My dad is about 6'2 and my mom is 5'8 (maybe 5'7)and I was my mom's height by the end of eight grade. I was 5'10.4 by Feb. 2020(junior year) and I really feel I was supposed to have gotten a growth spurt during this time. Unfortunately, I only grew an inch since this period(5'11.5), despite losing so much weight. As a guy, I severely underestimated the caloric needs of a young 17-18 year old male. I look even younger than I did in the early stages of the weight loss. (I'm about 171 ibs now and I feel alot better, but still not completely there hormonally)\n\n I know this is kind of a rant, but is there any chance that once I fully recover from this that my body will rapidly catch up developmentally to confiscate for the delayed development and maturity?

I've always been relatively above average in height. For example, by the end eight grade I was about 5'8 without any crazy growth spurt. Last year 2020 I checked my height for a yearly physical and I was 5'10.4 meaning I only grew 2.4 inches in 2 and a half years. I found this kinda odd since in puberty growth spurts usually happen. I was kinda chubby for my weight about 175-178 with high body fat, so I decided to loss some weight during quarantine(probably the worst decision I've made).

I regret eating those few days because it has taken me away from my goals. I want to look sickly so that people will finally take my suffering seriously. I want to die once this semester is over. I want to die underweight, with a 4.0 GPA, and with my last personal project finished. This might seem absurd to others but basically the impression I want to leave when I die is that I was capable and intelligent but felt so strongly about the injustices of the world that I made the premeditated decision to starve myself and die in protest. I've already started making plans for what I want to be done with what little money I have that was supposed to go towards my tuition for next semester but won't need anymore. I will go to the bank Monday to make arrangements. My starvation is not the cause of my suffering, but just one of many symptoms. \n\nIt's hard for other people to understand why I am doing this to myself. It's hard for people in a highly individualistic culture to wrap their mind around someone who only wants to live so long as they can make the world a more just place for others, and not so that they can experience pleasure. I think I can make my death more useful to my cause than any life I could have.

I have had a recent psychiatric assessment and there was nothing they could diagnose or prescribe other than ADHD and ADHD medication (which I haven't started yet, in case someone thinks that could be a possible cause of my thoughts). I had several appointments with a new therapist who agreed that my distress is due to external factors and whose only suggestion was that I would feel better if I just made myself eat. I spent months trying to live as if I am not struggling and that I am happy and putting myself out there but it made me feel worse because it was dishonest and alienating. I have given the insanity hypothesis rigorous testing and it doesn't hold up.\n\n I have had depression many times before. Depression is an unexplained unhappiness; my choice to die is a strategic decision akin to self immolation. As I have just detailed, I have done everything in my power to approach my issue as a psychiatric problem with no physical/external cause or due to malnutrition as others have suggested. At this point it is just silly to suggest that it's a chemical imbalance and that I'm not serious about this being a radical political act based on deeply held personal beliefs.

Some things are ok but for the most part nothing brings me the same excitement and happiness like a good binge or food in general.

965,Tangelo_Similar,t5_2s00i,"So this week I've decided to not listen to my ed and start recovering. I've been dealing with extreme hunger, ive lost my period and I was so tired of being tired, nauseaus and hungry all of the time. I was eating around 300-650 kcal a day for 3-4 months. On monday, I couldnt sleep till 5 in the morning, because I was crying and dreaming about all of the food that I didnt allow myself to have. This was my breaking point. So for the past 3 days I've been fully  honouring my hunger. This consists of eating about 3-4 chocolate bars, a pint of ben and jerrys, 3 donuts and a pizza a day. I thought that I could honor my hunger for a few days, get these cravings out of my system and go about living my normal life and start eating heathy again, but I feel like I cant stop. I still crave this junk so badly even after 3 days of eating it and Ive gained about 10 pounds. Although Ive been consuming big amounts of food, I dont feel like im bingeing, because when I eat and after eating I feel very happy and free.  But after these 3 days, today I stepped on a scale and saw that I gained 10 pounds. This made me feel so fat and ugly, but I dont want to start restricting again.I just dont know what to do now. Should I allow myself to eat like this for a few more days and hope that the cravings and extreme hunger will decrease and go away or should I go back to eating salads and healthy meals so I will not be fat again? pls help (sorry for any mistakes, English is not my mother tongue❤️)",1607708531,need advice asap,"[0.0017872294454506319, 0.24386975800691457, 0.001891889723661066, 0.015061622839110993, 0.08788277696937932, 0.19199120039657908, 0.11250708778937231, 0.0233340141835284, 0.000822655170084453, 0.3208517654759193]"
966,Tangelo_Similar,t5_2s00i,"Hey, everyone. I have been dieting from about March of this year. I've lost 20 kg( now i weigh 51kg and I am 171cm). With this, Ive lost my period for about 6 months. I've been severely restricting my calories for about 4-5 months and eating about 300-650kcal a day (healthy food but small portions) and lifting weights 3 times a week at the gym + 2 times per week cardio. But I feel like I cannot do this anymore, because of the extreme hunger that i have been feeling. all that I can think about is food: I watch lots of eating challenges, look through restaurant menus and pics of their food at my free time. I dont want to feel this way anymore. Unfortunately, I am 17 and I cannot get professional help on my ED at this moment. Tommorow I am planning on buying all of the foods that I was restricting on: chocolate bars, a pizza, donuts, cookies, ice cream and just letting myself eat however much I want for 2-4 days and then going to eating about 1000-1200kcal a day on a healthy diet ""to not get fat"" and stay generally healthy. I am scared of gaining weight, thats why I am not going ""all in"" and just planning on giving myself a break for a few days, especially because from this week the gyms are closed because of the coronavirus.I am also scared of gaining weight, because a lot of people have been commenting on my weight loss.The comments have been negative though, my friends and family say that i look too skinny, but for me it gives me a sense of pride and a feeling of control. Ok, I am getting distracted here. I just wanted to ask, whether letting myself to satisfy my extreme cravings and hunger for a few days and then going to not restricting my calories so severely, be an alright approach? and would I not gain a hugely noticible amount of weight?

Constipation seems like such a simple problem according to everyone who's ever had it. I feel so alone without any time with my doctors due to restrictions of treatment placed on them because of the pandemic. It's tempting me to restrict calories again, out of fear of making constipation worse. Apparently, extra fiber can make it worse, and with anorexia, extra fluids don't help much because my body is so used to devoting a smaller amount of water to the small amount of food I used to eat. Now that I'm trying to eat more every day, it seems my colon can't keep up.\n\nMy GI doc put me on Omeprazole 20 mg after I almost got down to 100 lb, thinking I had heartburn. He couldn't perform any tests besides a barium swallow (no swallowing problems) to see if my problems could actually be solved by Omeprazole because of pandemic restrictions. I feel no effect after being on it for 2 months, but I managed to gain 6 lb. in that time. My daily diet went from less than 1000 cal a day up to 1700 or more. I've now been dealing with what they think is constipation. I go once a day every day, easy to go. But some days, I don't go, or it's a small amount. They performed an X-ray and didn't call me for 2 weeks, so I thought I was fine. I called them, and they said I had a large amount of stool inside. I thought my constant bloating was just gas. My GI doc said not to take enzymes or probiotics because he doesn't want me self-treating.\n\nHe suggested Miralax, but I've been reluctant to use it from fear of laxative abuse (never binged, purged, or abused laxatives). I've never used it before and he never told me how often. I started having painful cramping and very few small movements, so I tried a fleet enema this morning (which I have done once with no problems). I think I cut something in there, because after I had the bowel movement, I had a few drops of bright red blood (never had anything like this before). No black blood in the stool. A nurse at an urgent care clinic said this is very common and that I should go ahead and take one dose of Miralax every morning until I start having normal bowel movements.\n\nIs it safe to start Miralax 2 hours after using a fleet enema (wanting to avoid kidney damage and dehydration), or should I wait a certain amount of time?

I eat &gt;!1000!&lt; calories a day and if I go over that I purge. I exercise to make this okay. I burn &gt;!500!&lt; cals a day in the gym. The binging and purging stops me from being underweight. The exercise stops me gaining weight. \nAnd now suddenly I have to rest? I’m really worried about the ED thoughts but also what do I do with myself in the day? I read a lot but don’t enjoy much else at the moment because of mental health, and one day of being home all day really effects my mental health. Idk if this is really silly and I’m being super dramatic but I’m really genuinely worried :(",1673209970,Sports injury and what do I do instead of work out?!

I’m just really worried now because I’ve been working toward this weight again with this nostalgia in mind but the closer I get the more I feel like I’m still too big, like my body isn’t changing enough and it’s not small enough.

1088,Yummyjamz,t5_33q99,"8 months ago, I decided it was time for me to loose weight because I kept being told “you’re getting chubby” and whenever I ate too much chocolate, chips, ramen noodles and other things I loved, I was told “you’re gonna get fat” and was even told “your stomach is getting bigger”. I never cared about how much I ate, what I ate. I ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted. \n\nBut after deciding to loose weight, I started eating as little as possible. Restricted myself from sugar, any junk food. Tried eating healthy and mostly veggies. Did an hour of workouts 6 times a week and eventually reduced it to 5 times a week. Ate 3 meals a day after every 3-4 and didn’t eat anything else after 8PM (my third meal would be before 8PM and that’s it). I started seeing results of loosing weight. It made me really happy because I started fitting in more nice clothes and was getting happier with my body. \n\nThe thing is that I lost my period after like 3 months of the start of my journey to this. Started loosing a lot of weight and was having no trouble. Whenever I saw any junk food or any other food, I wouldn’t be feeling like eating it. I had control. Didn’t even crave junk foods anyway. \n\nBecause I had lost so much weight and my period, my aunt got worried and took me to the doctor. The doctor weighed me and said I was underweight for my age and height. But I didn’t care anyways and continued to eat little and workout. \n\nBut on my 8 month of my journey, which was on December 29, during the holidays, I started to binge. The binge happened on new years Jan 1st when I had to go to a family event and they gave me sweets. I told myself “I haven’t had any sugary thing for months and since this is a family one time thing I should enjoy myself” so I ate a cookie that was on the table, then ate another, then another and another. Then ate many of the fruits on the table. And after I was done, my stomach felt so full. \n\nAfter that day, in the next day, I ate more than usual. I love having oatmeal for breakfast and I always have it like every other day and only once a day. The next day I ate 2 oatmeal’s, one in the morning, one at night. I started having oatmeal everyday after that and ate 2 then eventually went to 3. Then I started eating junk food. Ate so many chocolate that was given to me during the holiday gifts, then ate so much Nutella, and chips with cream cheese. I kept basically binging. \n\nAfter the holiday weeks break was over for me (Jan 9), I said I’m gonna get back on track and eat healthy again. So I did for 5 days and had control of myself. After 5 days, I started to binge again till now. My stomach is getting bigger again and I’m scared to gain all the weight I had 8 months ago back again. I still worked out 5 times a week during the holidays while I was binging, and still am to this day. But the binging is making my stomach get bigger and my face chubbier. I don’t want to get back to how I used to look like. \n\nRecently I had to give a blood test because my doctor told me to since I still don’t have my period back yet for about 6-7 months and he said I need to reduce my workout to 2 times a week and eat more.\n\nOn the other hand, I keep binging and have no control even though I keep telling myself “this is my last binge I won’t do it again tomorrow”. Basically with the binging I am eating more. However, the fact that my stomach is getting bigger and my face puffier, it makes me feel guilty after every binge. I still workout 5 times a week but it’s 20-40 minutes a day. I don’t know how I was so consistent and no food made me loose control but after the holidays I lost control of myself. \n\nThe doctor did tell me to eat more, and I want to listen but with the eating more, I want to eat healthier not binge on chocolate chips, so much peanut and almond butter and other things. \n\nWhat do I do?",1674318698,Scared of weight gain,"[0.0006847420692393992, 0.14206680360451257, 0.0007248406115118572, 0.03648606167759585, 0.12325743046969115, 0.216896656502415, 0.058462641636666784, 0.09340758306243568, 0.00543443342419511, 0.32257880694173663]"

I didn’t really want to drive hours on end by myself to a large city I didn’t know &amp; didn’t have the $ for other transportation, so he got kind of pissy.\n\nFast forward, him repeatedly asking me to visit again, and me saying no or maybe next year. By then, I had relapsed back into my eating disorder, as well as self harm, and barely had the energy to get out of bed, let alone travel. He then asked me to visit, I said no, because I just didn’t really want the stress of meeting someone when I was at rock bottom.

1129,[deleted],t5_2s00i,"Hi! Massive apologies in advance for this rant, I'm very panicky and I just needed to rant in a space where people will understand that I'm aware its irrational and makes no sense but also can't think a different way right now, so I could calm down and sort myself out lol\n\nSo I'm trying to recover after a massive lockdown triggered relapse last year, and I WAS doing really well. But I'm also moving country and just got put in a strict mandated isolation facility which is fine ofc, I knew what I was getting into, and I made sure I did loads of research and had a plan to cope because if anything could relapse me, locked in a small room with limited exercise opportunity and no control over my food is a def risk. The plan has a few aspects but really hinged on me renting a crosstrainer for my hotel room, which the website for these facilities said was allowed and I found a rental that would do it.\n\nFacility rundown - I got a menu and was able to select foods for the next two weeks. I chose the healthiest lightest options and opted out of desserts. I calculated the first two days as best I could and even then I'd say we're looking at \~2000kcal a day. My MAINTENANCE when I am ACTIVE (locked in a hotel room so not so much here...) is 1800. So ofc I'm freaked out and made a plan to obvs just eat certain bits, leave things like rice etc out. I'm allowed half an hour outside a day but I am not allowed to run. My room is small and I can fit the xtrainer and could slide it aside to do insanity but cant really run in here or get meaningful walking pace. \n\n(Note here.. I have behaviours associated with exercise. I workout obsessively but my brain refuses to count anything as calories burned UNLESS IT IS A CROSSTRAINER OR A TREADMILL. Like I can literally run for an hour outside but if I'm not on a machine no matter how much I consciously KNOW I burned calories, my brain will just.. nope. Not on a machine, doesn't count. 0 calories burned do an hour on the treadmill/xtrainer). \n\nTreadmills I lkterally have to use for 90-120 minutes before my brain counts it but for reasons unknown to me as to why this is a thing, x trainer I can use two lots of 30 mins in a day and I'm fine. So my plan so I could eat was: yoga am, 30 min xtrainer heavy cardio am, shaun t insanity workout, and then just ''walk'' gently with no resistance on the xtrainer all day while watching tv or whatever so I'm in motion. then 30 min cardio again before bed. \n\nHotel just denied me the xtrainer. I was so confused, website said it was allowed and they've just turned around and said I can't have it. What really pisses me off here is I had a welfare meeting on arrival where I was very clear about my issues and concerns and specified I was hiring a xtrainer and the nurses were like 'yep thats fine keep us updated on how you're doing'. So this ofc just sent me into complete panic mode. Now they've said I can hire an exercycle. Obviously I have immediately changed my order and I won't hear back till tomorrow if they have one available and I'm really hoping they do but if they don't I'm fucked. Even if they do my stupid ed brain which is now in total overdrive will refuse to consider it as calories burned and the only option I can see is to call the kitchen staff and ask them to not send me any food.. or just not open my door to get any or chuck it all or don't eat it and spend all day every day doing fuckin insanity videos and cycling as fast as I can on a bike.\n\nI'm just straight up freaking out at this point, I know once I calm down I can reassess and I'll call the nurse to talk about what to do but I really needed to get it out, sorry guys. Thank you for .. just having this space for me to panic so I can calm down and actually go deal with it haha.

1177,[deleted],t5_2zzq8,"I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not even sure If I’m posting this is the right place but ultimately I’m just looking for answers or ideas to why I barely eat. \n\nI feel like this all started about 4 years ago when I had gotten food poisoning. It left me sick and bedridden for about a month. That entire month I was eating nothing almost everyday. Maybe saltines here n there but I was mostly sleep for that entire month. I remember when I finally felt better and got to eat an actual meal it was hard. My teeth hadn’t been used or exercised in about a month so using them to chew things might’ve been the most painful feeling ever. I felt as though my teeth were getting ripped out of my gums, root and all. A very intense sore feeling. \n\nI found it hard to finish the plates my mom would make for me but my mom just told me that my stomach had probably shrunken and I just need to keep eating snd it’ll grow and I’ll be back to normal or whatever. \n\nI don’t know when it began after getting food poisoning but I kind of stopped eating all together, but not on purpose. I just won’t have an appetite for that day or I’ll literally be too lazy to make something or pick something up. Shit, I was too lazy to even order food on the phone I always had in my hand. It was just easier to not eat. Other days I would totally be hungry and hop in the kitchen and start to get down. But as soon as I sit down with that plate of food I just made, all my appetite would disappear and I would give it away or throw it away. Other days I’ll be in the middle of eating something and a wave of a feeling I can’t quite describe would stop me in my tracks and I’ll just be like “ehhh idk why but I don’t wanna eat anymore” it’s not like I’m disgusted by it or tired of what I’m eating I just don’t want to be eating anymore. \n\nFor me this is really messing with my mental and my physical being. I hate knowing how hungry I am and wanting to eat but never eating, even when the food will be right in front of me. I just can’t ever hold an appetite for longer than 5 minutes. So if I don’t eat when I’m completely hungry and have the appetite for it, I won’t eat for a couple of days. \n\nI got a boyfriend 3 years ago (still dating) and I thought one of the perks of having a boyfriend was the healthy relationship weight you pack on (which was perfect bc I was trying to gain weight already) but if anything I’m losing weight.

1181,[deleted],t5_2zzq8,"I'm at a very early stage in my recovery (my first appointment with my dietitian was literally last week), and I know that weight gain is inevitable in recovery, but I'm kinda scared of it. Also, I've heard that in anorexia recovery, before weight redistribution happens, most of the weight gain goes to your belly. I feel like this could be really triggering for me, and if that's a necessary step in recovery, then I'll try to make my peace with it, but if there's a way to bypass or avoid it altogether, I'm wondering how this is possible (in a healthy way of course). So I was wondering if it is possible to gain mostly muscle instead of fat in recovery to reduce the amount of belly fat I gain. I'm not looking to become a body builder, nor am I trying to prevent weight gain-- I know that the number on the scale will go up either way, and it needs to in order for me to be healthy, but in one scenario I will find myself a lot more triggered by the appearance of my own body whereas in the other scenario I might be able to make peace with the weight gain because I will see my body growing stronger and more muscular.

1182,[deleted],t5_2zzq8,"So I've already talked to my therapist, an eating disorder specialist, close friends, family, and others about my ED, and the general consensus is that yes, I do have an eating disorder, and yes, it is almost certainly anorexia. But I decided to go to my GP as well, just to see if he had anything else to say, and also to see if he could give me an \*official\* diagnosis, because then I would feel wayyy more validated. But oh god did it backfire. I swear to god, it's like he read a book on how to invalidate someone in their ED. First of all, he didn't seem to understand that an eating disorder is a MENTAL illness, NOT a PHYSICAL illness (even though as we all know, it can have physical symptoms). He didn't ask me any questions about my thought process surrounding food/exercise, and he hardly even asked me any questions about my behaviors related to food/exercise either. Almost everything he talked about/ asked me about was in regards to the PHYSICAL signs of an ED, not the mental ones. Like one of the first things he said was ""well your weight seems to be stable,"" which isn't even true, like yes I weigh the same as I did the last time I had an appointment, but that's because A) my last appointment wasn't even that long ago and B) I was already struggling with my eating back then. But if you look at the bigger picture, from like a year ago or longer, I have definitely lost weight over time. Also WEIGHT IS NOT THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS AN ED! How many times do I have to say it -- it's a MENTAL illness, not a PHYSICAL one. So on top of that, he kept focusing on the fact that my bloodwork came back normal (except for my hemoglobin or something), so I don't appear to be malnourished. Again, focusing on physical symptoms rather than mental causes. And then he wrapped it up by saying ""well, I think it's good that you're trying to do something about this now while it's not that bad before it gets worse."" Cue the whole ""I'm not sick enough"" overthinking spiral.\n\nIn summary, the healthy part of my brain is pissed off and knows that he doesn't know what he's talking about. But the ED part of my brain is like ""SEE??!! You're not sick enough! If you had lost more weight then he'd take you seriously. Now you need to keep losing weight and eating poorly until it gets 'bad enough' to earn a diagnosis! But until then, you're not valid!""\n\nUgh, I hate it.

1189,[deleted],t5_2zzq8,"I’ve struggled with body image since I was little. When I was 11 (21 now). I told my doctor I was afraid to eat, but exercising made me feel a little better about it. At 12 I was “underweight” and not eating. Everyone I ate I felt sick. My parents told me that I needed to “stop” because people were noticing, but did nothing about it. For years I struggled. Then I didn’t, or that’s what I thought, but I felt confident with my body. Looking back my eating was still pretty disordered: I wouldn’t eat and then id eat an tire box of cereal or a box of goldfish or other snacks. \n\n I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that is notorious for weight gain. Before, I had been “scale free” for about 10 years. I didn’t believe in them. A few weeks ago when I was feeling bad I bought one. I got on the scale and saw that I was 156lbs. 30lbs heavier and with BMI of 26/27. I’m 5 foot 4. but the scale also told me that my body fat % was pretty low, so I was confused. But I still felt disgusted with myself regardless. It’s hard to look in the mirror, hard to shower cause I can’t stand to see myself naked. I feel like a whale (though I don’t at all think other people who are heavier are ugly/or not worthy or anything like that). But I feel ugly and unworthy. I dread classes on zoom cause I can’t stand to see my fat neck. So I tried eating less. Did nothing. Tried eating less, stoped taking my full dose of meds, and walking 8 miles a day, obsessed with tracking everything on my Apple Watch: nothing. So I took to Instagram and found some wonderful accounts that helped people who were struggling. But I still don’t feel worthy of help: I’m not skinny, I try not to eat but then I do and I hate myself for it. The accounts were helping (finding exercise that I actually enjoyed instead of ones that I did for “punishment,” eat what you want to accept food and recover, etc. but now I had to coke hole because of my bipolar and my mom keeps talking about my weight no matter how often I ask her to stop. I told her I was struggling with eating, and that i was in recovery. She laughed and said I didn’t have an eating disorder. She keeps telling me I SHOULD be very aware of portions and how she’ll get me “back on track” weight wise. But that type of talk is so so damaging to me. It puts me back in a bad place.

1198,[deleted],t5_2zzq8,"Every time I confided in someone about my eating disorder, they immediately wanted to know if it was a control issue or a weight issue. But it wasn’t that at all.\nI had 2 jobs, was a full time student, and had just started a company. One of my jobs was night shift, 10pm-3pm, the other was mornings around 9-3. I had a full course load and literally every moment I wasn’t working or in class I was doing research, emailing people, making product, and coming up with new ideas. I would get home from my night shift and work on my business until 7 am, then would start getting ready for my other job. I’d sleep a little after that, then go back to working. My school days were back to back classes for 8 straight hours, I would do my homework for one class while sitting in another. If I didn’t have homework to do during class, I would start working on my business again. If I was with my friends, I was cutting materials, sketching designs, discussing possibilities while we sat and smoked a bowl. My friends said I was the highest functioning stoner they’d ever seen. My sleep schedule was destroyed, which in turn screwed up my eating schedule. I was stressed and exhausted and felt like crap at all times.\nIt started with my stress and busy schedule simply forgetting to eat or just not having time. Eventually I would get to a point of hunger where eating would actually make me nauseous. I lost 25 pounds in about a month.\n\nI recognized the problem early but honestly didn’t think it was worth my energy to try to fix it. I felt that the most valuable thing I could do with my energy was work on my business. It was something that hadn’t been done before, would legitimately help the environment, and would raise a lot of awareness for issues. Everyone was praising me and supporting me for it so I felt that’s what I should focus all of my free energy on. I felt like it was the most valuable part about me.\n\nI was legitimately too exhausted to make food, or go and get food. I ordered delivery often because it meant I would have more time to work, but eating fast food makes me sick because of intolerances I have to preservatives and artificial flavors. Plus, stress made it uncomfortable to eat. Eating was physically painful and nauseating at this point because of how bad my disorder had gotten.\nAnd it only got worse, because I wasn’t eating, I had no energy.\nI would sit in bed thinking about how badly I wanted to feel healthy again, and thinking about my hunger. I often didn’t have enough energy to get out of bed, let alone make a full meal or go drive to get food. I was too weak to stand sometimes because it had been days since I had eaten. I felt pathetic honestly. I remember thinking that if I died, then maybe my project would get the attention and funding it needed to get made. Most artists don’t find fame until they’re dead, was my mentality. It didn’t occur to me that if I was dead, my project wouldn’t happen because I wasn’t there to create it.\n\nThe tipping point was when my mom came to see me. She gave me a hug and I felt her arms wrap around me so easily, like there was nothing there. She pulled back and she looked so sad. She worked so hard to make me, all those years and all that work, and I was throwing it all away.\n\nI’ll be honest, I didn’t feel like I was worth getting better for. My depression was awful, I had full body stress hives, and I felt like I was a failure for not getting an impossibly huge project done in an incredibly unrealistic time frame. I was having severe panic attacks several times a day.\n\nI got better for my mom at first. She brought me to doctors appointments, made me food, and held me through my panic attacks. I could tell it broke her heart to see me like that.\n\nBut most of all, she made me feel worth saving.\nI never want to feel like that again, but more than anything, I never want my mom to feel that way again. I can’t believe I was so selfish to not think of how the people around me felt seeing me destroy myself like that.\n\nThat was over a year ago. My cheeks are fat, my skin is clear, and I love myself again. I feel strong again, and I’m grateful for my beautiful body and mind. I’m taking my time on this project, and I’m taking care of myself, because I know that I’m the only one who can get it done.\n\nThe people in my life worked hard to make me who I am today, so I’m working hard to make sure their efforts aren’t in vain.",1592013717,My eating disorder developed from severe exhaustion,"[0.055440786945954314, 0.06791562351104452, 0.11266422996467876, 0.019668350034425006, 0.0027508799098714476, 0.00890598247461087, 0.14496756210019143, 0.20370811477916215, 0.0002934050694110222, 0.38368506521065054]"

1217,[deleted],t5_o3plh,"I hope this post is appropriate for this sub and doesn't break any rules. I'm at a very early stage in my recovery (my first appointment with my dietitian was literally last week), and I know that weight gain is inevitable in recovery, but I'm kinda scared of it. Also, I've heard that in anorexia recovery, before weight redistribution happens, most of the weight gain goes to your belly. I feel like this could be really triggering for me, and if that's a necessary step in recovery, then I'll try to make my peace with it, but if there's a way to bypass or avoid it altogether, I'm wondering how this is possible (in a healthy way of course). So I was wondering if it is possible to gain mostly muscle instead of fat in recovery to reduce the amount of belly fat I gain. I'm not looking to become a body builder, nor am I trying to prevent weight gain-- I know that the number on the scale will go up either way, and it needs to in order for me to be healthy, but in one scenario I will find myself a lot more triggered by the appearance of my own body whereas in the other scenario I might be able to make peace with the weight gain because I will see my body growing stronger and more muscular. But then again, maybe this idea of ""fat=bad"" and ""muscle=good"" is just another facet of my eating disorder trying to disguise itself as ""healthy""\n\nI hope this post makes sense.

1222,[deleted],t5_o3plh,"***TW: I go pretty in detail about my insecurities and shit.***\n\n***Also this is long as fuck so if you're planning on replying buckle up ya lovable shits.***\n\nHey all,\n\nI'm stuck in this gap of wanting to want to recover and wanting to want to look thinner (if that makes sense.). I know which one I'm supposed to choose, but it's still frustrating and I'd appreciate if someone would address this.\n\nAt the same time, **I feel like I'm not that ready to recover and it can be more harmful to be forced into recovery in the long run but I also know ""you're supposed to recover as soon as possible.**"" Any advice/thoughts on this?\n\nI think one of the biggest things that's keeping me back from wanting recovery is that I'm a dancer. When I first started losing weight, I could tell my dancing was better. I had better body/energy lines, I was more graceful, I had more stamina, I was more flexible, etc. **Before when I weighed as much as I did, I was more heavy on my feet, got tired quickly, had less energy, and just was not as good. People in recovery are always like ""oh what your body looks like doesn't matter it on the inside that counts."" But in dance, it kinda does. It's literally about how your body looks and moves. Yes, it's also about your passion and expression, but what your body looks like is a big part of it.** I'm worried that when I gain weight my dancing won't be as good again, I'll lose my flexibility, and my body will look big and awkward. I know my fears are valid, especially the flexibility part, because when you have more body fat covering your bones it's more difficult to bend and twist yourself in positions (I know what it's like, I was ecstatic when I easily got into my teardrop backbend after I lost weight.) I strive to be the best dancer I can be, and that includes looking my best to myself, my peers, and audience. Dropping dance isn't an option for me, I truly truly love it and would rather die than be in a world without dancing. \n\nI'm also gender queer, (I'm an agender demigirl) and I hate how wide my hips were and the size of my breasts when I was at my weight before I lost it. When I was finally at my goal appearance (my anorexia was never about my weight, more how I looked) I finally felt my hips were at the right size and I could finally fit into the pants in the boys/men's section. For clarification, before my ED I disliked the size of my breasts more than I cared about how wide my hips were, but during my ED I was more focused on my hips. (I do not (think I) have gender dysphoria and am not diagnosed with body dysmorphia.) Anywho do you think that's coincidental or my ED played a part in it?\n\n**I'm also stuck between the desire to get stronger/build more muscle and stay small as possible.** Before I hated traditional exercises like squats or pushups or running (dance doesn't count) and honestly I still kinda do, but getting stronger is something I really want, even way before my ED. I don't know if wanting to exercise is my ED talking in attempt for any way to burn calories or a genuine desire. I do know my ED advocates for sticking only to cardio and any resistance training is absolutely off limits (my ED is terrified of ""bulking up."")\n\nI also have a shitty relationship with my father and whenever he's around or is mentioned I just want to exercise myself into oblivion and not eat for the next 10 days. EDs are a hell of a coping skill, nobody can deny that. But yeah, my anorexia is also a huge coping mechanism for me to deal with that shit.\n\nI did try to recover about 6-7 months ago, I was doing really well until I relapsed because my ED thoughts just started to become stronger and I wanted to crawl out of my skin, I hated my body that bad. It was to the point where I avoided showering because I couldn't stand my body and I screamed and had panic attacks whenever I finished cleaning myself. **I just really want confirmation that it gets worse before it truly gets better, because I think I was at that stage.** Honestly I kind of regret relapsing, because I can only dream about what I would have been like right now if I stuck with recovery.\n\nHonestly the only reason why I'm eating consistently or even entertaining the idea of recovery was because I got sent to 3 psych wards and I came out with more trauma than I came in with, and I'm absolutely terrified of getting sent back. I kid you not I have nightmares, and my memories of that place is literally why my insomnia thrives.\n\nSoo...  I would really appreciate it if any of y'all can answer. I bolded the questions I really want answered the most, but if any of you can address every paragraph that would really be appreciated.

This spiraled into depression as I felt that I was taking life, food, everything for granted. I felt deep anguish that I wasn't able to eat; something so simple to human nature. I've never felt so deeply worthless.\n\n4. I started equating ""work"" to earning food. Exercise, extreme sports, you name it. I need to earn my food otherwise I'm taking food for granted, expounding on that, I'm taking life for granted.\n\n5. I am afraid of food. I have unknown food allergies and I'm having a hard time justifying all this effort just to fucking eat. This is the kicker, I'm not AFRAID of anything. I spend my hobbies doing scary things for fun. However, my physical body reacts to food as if I'm going skydiving even though my mental state is fighting to get a forkful in.\n\nWhew, I think that's it. I think this is where I am right now.

1285,alexisseffy,t5_rbmui,"One stance on motivation in ed recovery is that the adolescent patient does not need to want recovery in order to recover and the parents cannot wait around for them to want recovery and must refeed them regardless. To an extent, I believe this is true because parents should not allow their children to starve to death and forced feeding may be warranted when the patient is in life threatening danger. However, force feeding only achieves physical recovery, not full psychological recovery. \n\nI feel like in order for someone to fully recover, they must have intrinsic motivation. They must want to get better for themselves. Some people use contracts to get their kid to cooperate, like if you eat, you can use your phone, but this system doesn't motivate people to change their behavior long term. \n\nIn my experience, I wanted to get better until I was forced into treatment. Forced treatment caused resistance to actual recovery. I became extremely resistant, partially out of spite and a need for control. I complied with my treatment teams expectation that I eat a minimum amount of food and maintain a minimum weight, but continued to count calories obsessively and eat only the few safe foods. Physically I was ""recovered"" - I got my period, was at a normal weight, and had normal vitals, but mentally I was very disordered. This ""quasi recovery"" did not last long and I relapsed. \n\nI believe that if I am going to fully recover, I need to want to do it for myself, to live a better life, not to please my parents or doctors or avoid treatment. In my opinion, forced recovery is not effective long term and keeps us in the cycle of partial recovery and relapse, and to escape it, we must chose recovery ourselves.\n\nOne of the few reasons that I want to get better is to be a doctor and help others with mental illness.

However the last couple weeks I have really been struggling with all the weight gain and body image. Plus theres just a lot going on in my personal life that feels chaotic and out of my control. I slowly started cutting things out of my MP. In the last week I've purged twice (when I first started tx it was every time I ate basically...which wasnt often). Since getting out of residential in march up until a couple weeks ago I had only purged 2x. Now it's been twice in the span of less than 7 days. I bought a scale, I'm restricting a LOT and I feel like my ed thoughts are starting to take over again. I met with my therapist yesterday who was like ""sooo....ur spiraling"" and I denied that I was. But the more i think about it, maybe hes right. He asked me not to weigh myself until at least wed (when i meet with my nutritionist and can process it with someone) and I agreed....but I got home and weighed myself anyway. And did it again this morning. I decided to actually have breakfast this morning (I havent had an actual meal all week except once. I've been surviving on coffee, adderall and the occasional protein bar). I cant stop thinking about how I'm a failure for eating this morning and I want to not eat for the next few days to make up for it.

I planned my meals days in advance and would refuse to eat or drink anything that ""wasn't planned"". I also insisted on working out several times a week even after I injured my leg (I pulled a ligament in my ankle and couldn't walk properly but still went to the gym). I tried to cut out sugar completely for half a year.\nFor a little backstory, I've always been on the smaller side, and I even became underweight as a teenager (not intentionally, my metabolism was just high) . Once I started university (and was on the pill for a year) I started putting on a bit of weight and finally looking healthier. I don't know why I took that guy's comment to the heart, especially since I was basically a size 8 (UK) at that point. After stopping the pill which made me gain weight and crave sweets a lot I went down a size (now i'm a 6) but I still tried to only eat twice a day for a couple months because I was terrified that I will ""get fat in lockdown"". \nWhat I do have is OCD and that's probably what caused this episode, and after talking about it with my therapist I've been feeling more calm and even eat 3 proper meals a day. But some days it's harder, and I think I'm gaining weight and I'm afraid of people pointing it out 😭 my family and gf are very supportive and compliment me a lot but sometimes i have this really twisted view of myself and my brain thinks that being overweight is the end of the world, when I should be thankful I'm not underweight anymore. \nBut ultimately I think I'm in the right direction to recover :) I feel bad for complaining about this to people since they just look at me funny and say i have nothing to worry about because I'm thin.",1605979741,First steps?,"[0.0014724417947138955, 0.10184253123181784, 0.001558668086629409, 0.03992936305620569, 0.0008503612881397821, 0.3122906594318841, 0.22478975899698878, 0.14031465755117414, 0.044710669210749183, 0.13224088935169726]"

I’ve always been really insecure about my weight so I decided it was finally time. I had heard about intermittent fasting and so wanted to try that out and also was trying to eat in a calorie deficit. It started out really healthy and then I started to restrict my calories a lot more.

I’ve been eating about 500 calories a day for the past 3 months and I am completely fine. It’s also still taking me really long to lose weight. I do get quite scared to eat anything with over 200 calories and I always plan out what I’m gonna eat because I can only eat a certain amount a day but I still look and feel just as fat as before. According the the scales I have lost 20lbs but I don’t see it at all. Also I feel like that’s barely any weight loss in like 3 months. So many other people have lost a lot more in a shorter amount of time. So my question is is this disordered eating? Is there anything wrong with this? I feel fine so I don’t see the issue.

1326,anothrrthrowawayy,t5_s5o7i,"**TW** - **TL;DR** at the bottom, sorry for the novel\n\nSo I deleted certain posts that were just too hard for me to read in my new mindset, but my post history can tell you I used to frequent this sub along with the other, r/EDanonymous. I’m 25 years old. It took me over 10 years to admit and confront the fact that I even had an eating disorder. I made excuse after excuse in my head to justify what I was doing, and reassure myself that it was not *actually* an ED, so it was fine. I would binge, but I didn’t binge “too much.” I would purge, but it was “too sporadic” to technically be considered bulimia. I was depressed and could not stand the sight of myself in a mirror- I mean truly disgusted to the point of anger and tears, avoiding shopping for clothing- BUT I wasn’t suicidal, so I thought I wasn’t truly clinically depressed, and I’ll just “get over it.”\n\n\nBut then the binging got worse. The purging went from once a week to after every single meal. I would chew and spit out most snacks, The depression was so bad I didn’t go a week without crying, I’d struggle to find meaning in much of anything, I had days where I just felt pure apathy. My anxiety was through the roof. The constant gagging, scratching, and stress on my throat from forcing myself to purge so much caused me pain and it scared me, but it was 50/50 whether or not I actually cared.\n\n\nThe *only* person irl I have confided in (briefly) is my boyfriend of 4 years who has been incredibly supportive and loving. And that was only until after I received the supportive words, advice, or even just anecdotal empathy from this sub that I found the courage (and could see the necessity) in telling someone I knew loved me and could be my anchor in the way people over the Internet can’t be.\n\n\nI thought my ED was harmless- just a small, tiny part of myself I chose not to show the world. We all have those parts of us, right? It’s totally normal, right? I was in my own world with my ED. Like a prison cell, actually. And nobody knew where I was or what was going on because by all accounts I was fine on the outside. But through being able to express my feelings, my thoughts, to vent on the awful days, to receive encouragement on the good ones, the reaffirmation, the cynical laughs and lighthearted ones, I just want to say thank you.\n\n\nThere are also people’s stories and posts who touched me so deeply (most times, in a rather poignant way...) that I literally haven’t stopped thinking about them since the initial read. So, in the best and most respectful way I can put this, thank you to those who scared me straight and silenced that fucking voice in my head long enough to make me really listen to your words and think about my health and my body. You are the reason I’m here and I appreciate that and wish the best for you all.\n\n\nI haven’t purged since June 1st. The longest I’ve ever gone between purges since I was 13 years old was, at best, 7-8 days. I haven’t binged at all. I let myself indulge in treats and can fight away the urges to throw it back up immediately. I’m not holding myself to huge expectations because I’m taking this one day at a time, but so far, I’ve never been this far into a recovery to see this fog clearing up and show me just how far deep I was into my ED and how depressed I was. If I hadn’t found these places to begin working through this or just to vent, I’m not sure if I’d be here quite yet.\n\n\nBecause I’m so fresh in recovery, I need to unsub for a while. But when I feel like I’m ready, I intend to come back and try my hardest to be that person for you all that so many of you were for me.\n\n\nSo even if you just lurked the sub or read just one of my posts, thank you for accepting my most vulnerable side. Pretty ironic on a public forum full of strangers, but I’m just overwhelmingly grateful I could shout my sorrows, my pain, and all the thoughts I spent over 10 years bottling up entirely (I wouldn’t even say the words ED out loud) into this void where I know it’s safe. I didn’t know until I got here *how* fucking badly I needed it. I was drowning for years and years and being here was like pulling the plug out of the drain and I could breathe a little easier.\n\n\nThank you. All of you. ***We are not our EDs. And we can beat them. All of us.***\n\n**TL;DR**: furthest into recovery I’ve ever been in my 12 years of having an ED. I can say I feel happy and it’s genuine. I’m fucking proud of myself and I *need* to thank this community. Can’t afford therapy but I was able to find relief and comfort here and I’m so grateful.

I was coping okay-ish with that, mostly following a most predictable pattern of ""wake up, drink lots of coffee, smoke weed, pass the time until it's 7pm and it's time to make dinner, then game, drink a bottle of wine and binge on plain popcorn until tired"".  \n\nConcurrently, I was dealing with a water infiltration issue under my floor (basement apartment) which had started in October last year but has gotten much worse with spring and the snow melt, on which my landlord has been dragging his feet. Now...this issue was...tolerable until two weekends ago, when the water issue got so bad I had to call emergency contractors, who then came and basically ripped up and dried my floor. In the meantime, I packed up my two cats and went to live with my parents for a few weeks, while everything is getting finally fixed.   \n\nIt's been a bit over a week now of being back at my parents' place. My mom is aware of my ED, and, in her way, is very supportive (which at first blew my mind because she was...less so when I first developped it 14 years ago). She doesn't pressure me to eat every meal (I just have to eat dinner), she got my dad to get me some of my safe foods so I can always have a safe snack, and she lets me make my own plate when I do eat, without comments.   \nMy dad has also gotten better at commenting on what/when I eat, which is weird and surprising and unexpected, considering his petty comments fueled my ED all my adolescence.  \n\n However, the family dynamic hasn't changed, and being back there, as odd as it may seem, makes me feel like I am once again that 16 year old kid that tries to be as quiet as possible, that tries to not inconvenience or get in the way, the way an unxpected guest might. This has been brillantly fueling my restrictive ED, especially because my room is next to my parents', they go to bed earlyish and the dog stays with them (if she hears me go to the kitchen, she will jump off their bed and run downstairs. She's not a small dog by any means). So I eat like...one meal a day, with a light snack after, and 2 hours later, I can't fall asleep because all I want is to make pancakes and eat them without anyone hearing me.\n\nThe point to this rant, I guess, is that I miss having my place, my freedom, my schedule, my shitty habits and my even shittier midnight snacks, but at the same time, being back home is teaching me a whole 'nother level of discipline through anxiety, and I lost &gt;!3.5lbs!&lt; in less than a week thanks to a lot of repressed trauma from my adolescence and constantly feeling like I have to prepare a justification for everything I eat.   \n\nThank you for reading my weird rant ♡",1586818045,"I want my life/space back, but at the same time...","[0.19672939424703703, 0.14492115434596603, 0.057524279125560296, 0.016013330036550203, 0.057039915633033095, 0.11569338241838789, 0.10102411635415995, 0.12982682563426362, 0.0004634742906090582, 0.18076412791443291]"

If it is not my stomach it is my boobs. If it is not my boobs it is my teeth. I never had a mom that really taught me self-love and unfortunately, you cannot teach your child what you don't know or have yourself - words from my therapist &amp; life coach.

And as long as no one cares - then I will continue to fast, restrict, and save up for surgery because now as an adult I realize people do not give a shit. When I was 17 I made the mistake of telling my mom I had an ed she did not comfort me - she judged me and punished me for not being perfect. She made fun of me. Then recently she told me that she was bulimic too and my grandmothers have ed - so this runs in the family. It is too late I already feel comfort within communities like this one. People online are so much nicer and understanding than family or friends irl. I am sorry but I do not think my disordered eating will ever end. Especially with social media and constantly seeing other people with these great bodies. It just feels unfair that I never even had the chance to love my body.

I decided to go all in on recovering. I ate actual ice cream Sunday night. I cried A LOT but I did it. I ate scrambled eggs and pancakes, ACTUAL CHEESE (vegan cheese is just not the same) and I made turkey and rice soup for dinner. I even made the l turkey stock myself for the soup.

I quickly got back into fitness and traded starving myself for lifting weights and still restricting, but prioritizing protein bc ~health~ \n\nI’m a clown. I spend all my free time exercising.

My poor boyfriend pays the price here. How could I feel so good about myself but still too uncomfortable to be intimate with the man that loves me? So no period. That’s not good. I guess it’s a win that I’m not celebrating not having a period? Besides that, I have been constipated for 2 months now. Nothing seems to help or work. I feel like I’m lugging a bowling ball around with me. If it wasn’t for all the negative tests, I’d assume I was 9 months pregnant and about to pop. Every day is started with extreme discomfort that only gets worse as the day goes on. I hate it in this hellhole I’ve created for myself. On the outside it seems like I’ve got it together.

I see the oil, bread, pasta, whatever (typical fear foods) and have to keep scrolling. I get nauseous looking at it now. Matter of fact I get nauseous every meal now.\n\nI have been lifting as heavy as I can for the past year or more and today was a lift day. My lifts were terrible since I started restricting again because I have no energy and recovery is harder. All this is obvious so last night I let myself eat a little more in hopes of getting more protein to help me today. When you’re lifting you want to have 1g of protein per lb you weigh essentially to promote muscle growth. I have been falling short on protein. Today I make sure to get a good amount in each meal (I had more than one!) and each time feeling full got me so sick. \n\nBreakfast was relatively small but I wanted fuel for my lifts. Lunch was a double scoop of protein mix to help with recovery. Dinner was meat and veggie stir fry and I couldn’t finish it.\n\nI thought about this dinner since last night, I was so excited to try to recreate the Panda Express super greens as a side! My husband lifted today so it would be a great meal for both of us to hit our goals.... but I couldn’t finish it!! Calories were no problem! I could have had seconds and still be within my goals. BUT the feeling of being full was grossing me out.\n\nI had issues as a teen but I am 31 years old now.

I have been working at being healthy the last 3 years! My labs are amazing! I’m a little over weight but my doctors never brought it up as a concern. I know exactly what I need to do to stay on a good path but I am addicted to seeing the scale going down. It hasn’t gone down in so long.\n\nThe worst part is besides this I am the happiest I’ve been I think... ever! My marriage is amazing right now, which means more to me than most of the other stuff. Work is shut down because of covid but I think I’m okay with it. Family is... fine because my side of the family is on the other side of the country.

He follows a lot of IG models on instagram, or simply just girls that he maybe has been with in person with INSANE bodies that follow him back.

1380,bombdiggityboo,t5_33q99,"Hi everyone,\n\nThis will be my last post for at least a week, but I wanted to share a few things in this reddit because of how hard I looked for the ""one"" solution and so desperately each day wanted to ""just get better.""\n\nIf you want the VERY moment I realised I was recovered, it was on a Christmas Day evening when my kind of boyfriend broke up with me (yes on Christmas Day) and the next morning rather than waking up and binging, I felt calm and like the last thing I wanted was food. I guess I had an ""epiphany"" that if I was binging, I needed to get to the root cause rather than numbing myself with food. I realised in that instance that having a ""kind of"" boyfriend wasn't healthy for me, and it was destroying me from the inside out.\n\nHowever, I've compiled a much more general list below which doesn't involve your SO breaking up with you! :) If you read the list like a roadmap to recovery, it may help you, even if you take one thing on. Everybody's journey is different.\n\nHow did I know I reached ""real"" recovery after 15 years of trying?\n\n1. I stopped body checking: I wasn't constantly comparing my body size to random strangers on the street. Yes it's as creepy as it sounds!\n2. When I wake up in the morning, my first thought isn't about food. I found other things to be excited about and purposely booked things into my weekend such as catch ups with friends that meant I \*had\* to be social.\n3. I began to focus on other hobbies that didn't centre on food e.g. learning how to watercolour and talking walks, urban sketching etc.\n4. I stopped using my weight as a success marker, and started using my emotional state as a marker instead: was I feeling generally happy? Have I been getting enough sunshine? Am I more present with my child?\n5. Skip this one if you're squeamish: my body just works better - I am not farting uncomfortably all day, my bowel movements are more regular, I am not constantly out of breath, and my thighs only chafe raw if I wear something too small like stockings\n6. I rely on other methods to get me through tough emotions. It was ALWAYS food and ALWAYS sweet or salty. Now I will message friends, snapchat them, take a walk, get outside, or clean my house (it's therapeutic for me okay haha), try and watercolour (badly)\n7. Finally figuring out that I can't rule the world from my bed. I would spend all day in bed, watching Netflix and not getting out at all. This really fuelled my depression and made it impossible for me to progress without getting up for the day.\n8. I got over my intense fear of hunger. I had intentionally starved myself for years to be the smallest possible version of myself but that wasn't sustainable and I was very weak - prone to passing out and constantly cold. This made me very scared of feeling hungry. But now I know hunger signals that...I have to eat. And I always honour this hunger, so now I don't feel fear at all.\n9. Realising that my 4yo son was starting to pick up on my most destructive behaviours - eating in secret by hiding under his bed and squirrelling away food for later. This broke my heart honestly. I already felt inadequate because I am a single parent, but this honestly was a dagger in my heart. Moving past these and enjoying all foods with my child has now given us both so much freedom - he doesn't hide food anymore.\n10. Going to a therapist who takes none of my BS. She calls me out when I'm even considering dieting, and honestly I am kind of scared of her in a good way haha. She is very direct, which is exactly what I need!\n\nEnjoy your week people, and remember to count every tiny step of progress as a success. Little by little you will get there.

1381,bombdiggityboo,t5_33q99,"Hello again!\n\nTrigger warning: Disordered Eating descriptions\n\nWasn't expecting much interest in my first post as I'm not really a huge poster to Reddit but since a few people seem interested, I thought I would post some more tips that might help. Please remember that your journey will look different from mine. No one person's journey will look the same xx\n\n[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/10mtv8y/how_i_recovered_after_15_years_of_struggle_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) here is a good place to start if you haven't already seen it.\n\nTop tips\n\n1. **Set yourself a small achievable goal to start** \- something you can do that has \*nothing\* to do with food. For example, mine was to get 8 hours of sleep per night. For me the reason this linked to my Binge Eating Disorder was because my Inner Critic was always telling me I was bad at ""everything"" and unsuccessful because of my size. It was an excellent way to begin to prove myself wrong.   \nAnother small achievable goal was to buy a bag that carried more ""things"" in. What does this have to do with success? Well I bought myself a backpack/rugsack/knapsack and in it I could finally fit a bottle of water and snacks without killing my back. Now I know I will never run out of food ever - I always have snacks available. I cannot tell you how many times a binge of mine started with fearing I would ""get hungry later"".\n2. **Don't expect overnight success.** This can be SO hard. Diets promise almost instant success - but what they don't say is the majority of people put all the weight back on plus some. As I said in my previous post, it wasn't until a year of therapy that I felt strong enough to make changes without feeling like I was putting myself on a diet. For me, realising that I have been trapped in disordered eating for 15 years meant that I could take a bit of time to undo this. If I've tried keto, Atkins, low carb, intermittent starving...oops I mean ""fasting""..., Paleo, no sugar, dairy free, gluten free, and countless other diets, then surely I can give myself a reasonable amount of time to work on my recovery.\n3. **Promise yourself you'll never ever diet again.** Look up the Minnesota Starvation Diet if you like. Or any diet ever. If someone is selling you something to do with diets - who is making the money and getting successful? Hint: it's not you or you wouldn't be here :( it's the diet industry that makes billions each year (no exaggeration). This step may take a long time to actually believe. When I promised myself I would ""never"" diet again, I ate everything in sight. It was like the Last Supper Syndrome but never-ending. \n4. **Stop focusing on weight as your only goal.** What??? But I weigh x. Mmmm I've been there. It hurts. Let me tell you from firsthand experience (and trust me - my Fitbit tells me I've lost the same amount of weight over 20 times), if you focus on your weight, you may never be free from your disordered eating. Focus on enjoying life now rather than thinking how much better life will be when you are in a smaller body. At my lowest, I weighed almost half of what I weighed at my biggest. I didn't get my period. I could only eat a few bites of any meal. I was obsessed with exercise and counting my visible ribs (it was gross). I lived in constant fear of gaining even the tiniest amount of weight. It was anything but fun people.\n5. **Find a strategy that works for YOU.** For me, reading Lyndi Cohen's Your Weight Is Not Your Problem really made everything click into place for me. I'm currently working through her recovery journey as outlined in her book, based on Maslow's theory but adapted to disordered eating. I've currently 'graduated' (in my own mind) from covering the basic needs (Level 1) consistently, to Level 2, which is core habits. She also has YouTube videos if you're interested in finding out more. And maybe a podcast? Anyway I know there are so many dieticians out there who are NOT focused on weight loss and you probably have your own favourite. Go chuck them a follow instead of a ""fitspo"" account that could make you feel worse about yourself.\n\nSorry, I've realised I've gotten a little harpy. Anyway, signing off now to get my 8 hours of sleep :)",1674892967,How I recovered after 15 years of struggle with BED Part 2,"[0.04266931588641717, 0.08278836307468995, 0.23545181984787733, 0.07228993889253962, 0.04980325536334083, 0.11796336027335647, 0.3183739962635528, 0.011101767554320678, 0.00030428045515238847, 0.0692539023887528]"

However after a lifelong struggle with disordered eating, I’m FINALLY making progress (33F). \n\nI really really hate talking about weight since I know it’s triggering for so many people but for example, after month one of true recovery, I lost 10% of that above weight without trying. \n\nWhat did I do?\n\n1. Finally got a doctor that took my disordered eating seriously. So many doctors think oh she’s overweight and EDs are only for underweight people. This took me 3 years. \n2. From the above doctor, got a referral to an excellent psychotherapist who specialises in disordered eating. \n3. Gave up other things financially so I was able to see her once a month on a reduced rate (I’m a single mum to a 4 year old) \n4. Went to my therapist even when I felt like I was going backwards, gaining more weight, or felt hopeless. \n5. Changed medications at the advice of my therapist as I had built up an immunity to my previous antidepressants \n6. Realised that eating is NOT the root of the problem but that there are other things that cause me to turn to food \n7. After one year of therapy, I felt safe enough to try and put into practice some of the coping strategies my therapist has been telling me the entire time \n\nWhat were the key things I have learned from therapy?\n1. Food is not your friend. It doesn’t have emotions or a soul. It’s not “good” or “bad” - it’s just food. \n2. Food is a temporary Band-Aid to a long term problem (managing your emotions rather than numbing them was mine)\n3. Find enjoyable movement that makes you feel good. For me it’s walking. Nothing too strenuous (again this works for me). \n4. No food is off limits and dieting doesn’t work. Ever. They all fail. \n\nIf you are not in a position to afford therapy - if you do nothing else PLEASE read Your Weight Is Not The Problem by Lyndi Cohen. It provides you with a roadmap to recovery.

1453,chaska479,t5_s5o7i,"I feel like every second of my days at this point of my relapse I am thinking about food. I open mfp 3 times an hour to remind myself what I'm going to eat today or what I already ate today or what I'm going to eat tomorrow. At this point I have my food planned thru Friday and part of Saturday. Planning to splurge on French toast which I'm questioning if it will even happen. I say this because last week it was cajun chicken alfredo with cheddar garlic biscuits. Then I talked myself out of the pasta bc it would be better to just have a grilled chicken salad with the biscuits instead of two calorie bombs in one day. Then I ""binged"" on cake I made for someone else (just two pieces) so I scratched the biscuits and didn't have the salad either and just didn't eat all day bc of the cake. I would say I'm high restricting because I'm a very short person who would get very low calories on a diet without exercise anyway but I'm undereating for sure and the obsessive food thoughts are really concerning. I think it's been 8 weeks of relapse. My husband seemed to be catching on and said ""I'm not dumb, I know you're down to one meal a day"" but he has been surprisingly fooled by me breaking down 1 decent meal into 3 super low calorie meals. He is complementing my weight loss and exercise but today he guessed how much I lost and he guessed half! Clearly he has no clue what's going on despite us being in the same house 24/7 due to work from home/ covid. If I get skinny he'll get worried but right now I'm still overweight. I figure it'll take another 8 weeks to not be overweight. I just have a bad feeling this could turn into my worst relapse. I feel way too in control and no where near on the verge of a real binge. I plan my food very carefully to get a decent amount of protein and fiber and I'm taking vitamins. For a bit I was feeling super tired and weak but then I got over it. I'm having no ill effects compared to previous relapses, probably because I'm not living off sugar like before and not doing much fasting. Just venting I guess about the fact that I'm spiraling and no one has a clue.

1454,chaska479,t5_s5o7i,TW: I am not straight up anorexic so if you are and fear gaining weight this post may not be for you. \n\nI have relapsed 6.5 weeks ago. I would say that I have ednos because for 25+years I have gone through a variety of symptoms from restricting to restricting with purging to restricting with over-exercising....but in between I guess I don't all out binge eat but I eat enough to go from lower end of normal weight to obese (not just overweight) in about 6 months times. I have actually spent more time obese as an adult than not. But when I relapse I relapse hard. The side effects are horrible. \n\nSo where I'm struggling right now is after 6.5 weeks of eating half what I could lose weight on I am still overweight and starting to feel like absolute crap. I can barely move today. I literally have 730 steps for the day and it's lunch time. So I'm sitting here battling with myself that this is ridiculous and stupid because I could eat 500 extra calories and burn that 500 calories because I'd have the energy to move. Up until this point I've been running several days a week for 30ish minutes and walking on the other days but I seem to have hit a wall. \n\nMy smart adult self knows right now that just because I relapsed doesn't mean I have to stay here until I lose all the weight. If I can starve myself I should be able to eat the correct amount to lose weight in a healthy way. But I feel like the only way I ever attain a healthy weight is through extreme methods.\n\nI didn't relapse to lose weight. I can just only handle a certain level of anxiety and once in awhile something is too much and it's like once I miss a couple meals a switch flips and I can just go straight from overeating to starving. Thankfully I haven't purged in several years. \n\nBut my point is just sitting here weak and tired sucks and I want to get up and run or walk but I don't want to eat 😩 So I need to talk myself into snapping out of this before half my hair falls out for the umpteenth time along with all the other effects of starvation. But I keep thinking just a few more days of restricting and then I'll eat more.,1610563277,Relapse struggles,"[0.058782250640963, 0.04957674733765686, 0.001477352903016339, 0.001327500008038465, 0.0008059982291436472, 0.37425305151248706, 0.18176075797339494, 0.01822123835333856, 0.0006424010810491607, 0.31315270196091205]"

1467,citrussyphon,t5_2ydy9,I’m not sure if this is asking for advice or just shouting into the void but here it is. I have struggled with restriction since I was about 14. It was really bad in my teens years the calorie intake was insanely low and it fucked up my metabolism. I really have not been able to lose or gain more than 10 pounds in the past 10 years. I still restrict constantly because I know what I want my body to look like in order to not be in a constant state of panic. Anyways I’m starting new medications and at least two of them are almost guaranteed to cause weight gain and I am terrified. My rational brain knows its not that bad to gain weight but the ED brain says this is my worst nightmare. My doctor prescribed a metabolism booster that will help regulate weight but the nausea I get from it makes it near impossible to work.

Only a full family. Ever since my dad died she has only had myself and her. She has a PLETHORA of health issues and barely eats anything.

I used to and sometimes still do, view food as a reward when I do certain things. Other times I use food as what it is, just to keep me from passing out and staying somewhat alive. Other times I just want to puke thinking about food.\n\n99% of the time, nothing sounds good food wise and I feel sick thinking about eating.

I have an EMG on the 15th and i already know what they're gonna say. She says if it ends up involving surgery they wont operate cause im too fat. I cant lose weight. Ive tried. Every fucking way i can think of and it always comes back and then some. Also, you cant exercise like you want to when youre in too much pain to even walk.\n\nI told her i legitimately will just kill myself if this continues because I cant handle it anymore. She tells me to shut the fuck up and i retort with she doesnt understand. She says she does she used to be 230lbs. Im like WHOOP DEE FUCKING DOO! IM OVER 300LBS AND 5FT 4.5IN IM GONNA DIE!

I saw my GP today and she is worried since my weight has dropped even more from my last visit with her and suggested that I may need to be hospitalised but I really do not want to be.

1532,daisycaulfield,t5_2zzq8,"Hey everyone,\n\nI must say I am really worried about my gradual but now sudden weight loss that keeps dropping.\n\nSo basically I came off antidepressants last December and they made me gain quite a lot of weight. They made me end up weighing 57 kg (I think that's like 125 pounds or something?) but keep in mind I am only 5'3 tall and female. So when I came off them I gradually started to loose weight and I actually didn't really notice it at all. I was definitely eating less because I was not as hungry as I was on antidepressants (they made me feel constantly hungry all the time). It was not until about 2 months ago probably around April that the weight started coming off even more and when I started to weigh myself very often. When is started to loose quite a bit of weight I was really happy. I am also at university full time so I am very stressed and already depressed. I will admit that I have started to get overly obsessive with calorie intake and check how much calories most things I eat have and have reduced my portions substantially. I am always thinking about food and my next meal which is debilitating. I worry about like how many calories in fruit and pretty much everything. I am afraid that i'm starting to get scared of food. I want to exercise but I don't think I eat enough so I would feel dizzy and I get migraines so that wouldn't help and had this fear that I would have to eat more if I exercise which is so ridiculous I know. I now weigh 49.7 kg (I think 105 pounds?) and yesterday I weighed 50.2 I don't know why the weight keeps coming off because I think i'm still eating the same as I did which is really strange and quite concerning. I think when I started to weigh my self more frequently (now every day) I get more restrictive with what I eat. I actually increased my portion for breakfast a bit yesterday but it made me feel sick. When I started to restrict my diet I felt hungry all the time but now I don't even want food, I feel like im forcing food down me. I feel really tired everyday and can hardly concentrate when doing uni work. I am very health anxious and keep thinking  what if I have a disease like cancer or something wrong with me that is causing all this weight loss. Thats really freaking me out. Should I call a doctor and get a blood test?

1535,daisychain066,t5_o3plh,"Yesterday morning My wonderful primary doctor called me, off the books on his day off, because he saw some bad electrolyte blood/heart monitor test results attributed to damage by my 5 year struggle and current, aggressive progression of anorexia. He got worried about my current decline and radio silence— as I have been skipping my blood work and canceled/failed to make appointments. I only got blood work this week because I was feeling so scary awful this past week that I got scared. I was glad he called because I’ve been struggling to convince myself to follow up monthly with my PCP and get my weekly testing for some reason. I just wanted to push everyone away and prove them wrong I guess.\n\nI told him on our call that I have an phone assessment at a ED specialty center on Monday and was feeling doubtful and ambivalent....mostly angry at the upcoming appointment. He pleaded and encouraged me to be honest on the phone with the specialist. He spent a whole hour, unpaid, listening to my fears and doubts and ambivalent feelings surrounding recovery and confrontation of everything. He begged me to start seeking treatment and told me that I could die by 35 if I keep going the way I am (I’m 28). He informed me that different organ systems are showing damage along the way. Heart, bones, metabolic systems...He told me he would suggest I go to the ER for this abnormal blood work, but I’m not going to because I’m afraid they are going to section me. I made the specialty center assessment appointment so he won’t section me and if I go to the ER I’m certain they will railroad me into a psych ward.\n\nWhat really is guilting me is, Despite his kindness and care, I feel almost ambivalent towards him for calling and being so kind.... And I hate that. I hate for feeling that way since he has been my only advocate and support in this. I’m growing ambivalent towards everyone and I don’t even recognize this behavior as “me” anymore.\n\nDespite him warning me… Despite the shocking and hard truth....I’m weirdly ok with this news. The worst part about this is that I know what I’m doing to my body and his warning was indeed very troubling, but part of me just doesn’t care. Despite knowing logically what I’m doing, how I’m killing myself, how even with a surprise phone call from my doctor (who is the only person who knows about my ED since I’m isolated from family and have few friends) I still feel feelings of ambivalence and welcome the news of death and destruction. I don’t want to die though. I don’t want this hell but I’m feeling trapped. I don’t even recognize these thoughts anymore. It’s self-destructive, self-loathing, and I’m annoyed and angry at his concern. This anger towards him makes me hate myself and feel guilty of all the care he extends to me. Angry at myself For being so irrational and acting and feeling like this. I feel undeserving of his above and beyond help and messages of encouragement. I feel like I’m wasting his time since he has other real patients who can use his care and get better. It’s constantly replaying in my mind and this rumination is interfering with my duties and making me feel ashamed.\n\nI need to be rational. I know have a choice to make And I don’t know if I have the strength to or even the want to make the right one. That makes me feel so guilty of all the effort and care he has done.

1570,domariep,t5_s5o7i,"TW: weightloss, intermittent fasting, (no numbers)\nThis will most likely not be super coherent.\n\nI went to my fairly new primary care today for only the second time. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD after several tests, and they started me on Adderall. My initial concern was that it would kill my appetite, but she assured me that symptom mostly happened to children who were on Adderall. I took her word for it, but I am definitely having appetite suppression from it. So, at today's appointment, I expressed my concern over how much trouble I've been having making myself eat, purely because I can't decide, or nothing sounds good, or its too much work, even in the evenings when the meds are wearing off. \nI work with a therapist and a psychiatrist on the regular. It was my therapist who diagnosed me with Atypical Anorexia almost a year ago, and told me that what I thought was Bulimia all these years was more in line with Anorexia with purging subtype. That the ""binges"" ive described are not binges, even if I feel like it. And also that just because I purge, doesn't mean its automatically Bulimia.\nI've been working on eating more often since then, but its been a struggle, even before the Adderall. The ""Atypical"" part of this diagnosis is only due to the fact that im overweight. My therapist has been working with me on getting my body out of starvation mode since last year. Explained to me over and over that I need to eat more often, that it will help with my dissocation, and that my body would stop feeling like it needed to store everything i ate of it could trust that it would consistently get nutrients. \n Last year, when I was working very hard to eat more and not restrict and get away from food rules, it really did help me feel a lot better mentally and physically. Lately though, with bad life things and feeling out of control, and more recently these new meds, I've fallen right back into old habits. \nWhen I expressed how much I was struggling with eating to my primary care, she told me I should just do intermittent fasting, and that she does it and is a huge believer in it. She explained IF(which, trust me, I've already researched heavily in the past) and told me to only eat from 4pm-10pm. I didnt know how to explain that my current eating window is basically 7pm-8pm, if I can even make myself eat by then. Last night I didnt eat until 11pm, and I know it wasn't enough. She said if I start eating more often, ill just be hungry all the time and start eating way too much.\nShe also recommended tht I dont tell my therapist and psychiatrist if I do IF, and even said I should  take a break from therapy. She said im focusing too much on my mental health and that I should just focus on other things. So, basically, I asked for advice on how to eat more often, and get around decision paralysis im having when it comes to choosing food, and she just told me not to. Currently I know im not eating enough, I feel like shit, im not trying to lose weight and I am anyway, and there's no way its at a healthy rate. But its like all she could see was the weightloss,and that im overweight so its not hurting anything. Unconcerned about my rampant vitamin deficiencies my other doctor found after a lot of bloodwork, she suggested I up my ADHD meds, and also get a foot pedal thing, like a stationary bike I can use in the evenings if im sitting down. She knows about my eating disorder, but im not even sure she agrees with my mental health teams diagnosis. \nThe eating disorder part of my brain wants to take her advice. Its basically a free pass to descend into a place i havent been since high school. Don't get me wrong, im still disordered, but I've been working so hard to get past my ED thoughts and their control over my life. And she basically just dismissed it all, and said it was all a good thing... or, at least, thats how I interpreted it. Its like all the work I've done in therapy was/is for nothing.

I guess putting it into the void feels better than keeping it to myself. I had therapy today and my therapist, who I've been seeing for over a year, asked if we could talk more in depth about food stuff. She told me she had been thinking a while about how I talk about food and my behaviors. This got around to pulling out the DSM5 I think? She read out descriptions of eating disorders to me and had me answer yes or no and I guess how it ended is that she doesn't think i have bulimia because i don't technically binge. I have been being good about not purging lately and I guess that does go with eating less. I guess its just weird to me because I thought my behaviors were normal because they're not as severe as they were in high school. Im 25 now and I knew i was struggling but I never thought I'd be diagnosed as an atypical anorexic. I guess I'm just having a lot of mixed feelings about it.

Long story short I confided in my sister a few months ago that I thought I had an ED and she got mad at me for “springing it on her” while we were hanging out and she just wanted to have a good time. \n\nA few of you suggested that she also had an Ed and I’m pretty sure that you were right. I have since started therapy and have been working with a dietician and she has continued to lose weight and talk about her weight loss almost every time I see her. She also is always “not feeling well” and will use it as an excuse to skip meals or eat very little. Hearing this is SO triggering for me because she’s already half my size and it just makes me feel like shit for eating. \n\nOf course I’m also worried about her and don’t know how to help. I’m nervous to out her to my parents because I don’t want her to out me as well but I don’t want to just sit by while her seemingly new-ish Ed gets worse. I’m also really easily triggered and have some issues with jealousy with her. Her mental health issues have always taken precedence over my own in my parents eyes because I’m really good at pretending to function and she isnt. It’s hurtful and frustrating and I wish I could be open about it with my family but I don’t even have an official diagnosis and am not ready to talk to my family about my issues yet. \n\nI’m fully at a loss for what to do here.,1594915539,I suspect my (27f) sister (24f) also has an ED and Idk how to help,"[0.0612350537420877, 0.05479321677886153, 0.002386054268818099, 0.002144028725004786, 0.001301757698774264, 0.18315860406303117, 0.5631869515064633, 0.1221133192034341, 0.0010375339829780394, 0.008643480030546989]"

The problem I have ALWAYS had with therapy is that I will absolutely never just volunteer information without being asked to. It’s like a mental block, I literally can’t. So I’ve gone to therapy in the past and my therapists have totally thought everything was fine until the shit hit the fan and I had a breakdown or something else crazy happened. \n\nThis time around I have been trying to be honest about my feelings around food and my body and life in general and have had some really good therapy sessions. But. My therapist never specifically asked about what my behaviors are beyond bingeing and overeating so of course I didn’t volunteer any info about my “extreme diets” (restricting) or even my small bouts of purging that I went through a while back. \n\nAnd so of course now my therapist wants me to see a dietician to help me with food and I’m all for it. Little do I know, she asked ALL the right questions and now my therapist is going to know everything and I’m dreading it. I know it’s for the best and I don’t even think it will be that bad but the moment that she brings it up I just know will be soooo weird and uncomfortable and I don’t know how to deal with the anticipation of having to have that conversation. \n\nI know this is a step in the right direction but I’m so torn between feeling relieved and feeling so ashamed at everything I did and still do.

So growing up I only ever ate one pop-tart at a time, one waffle, tiny bowls of cereal, one toast, etc. But my mom also had weird rules like I was not allowed to refuse juice with dinner or ask for any milk skimmer than 2% because that would be crazy. I still ate a lot sometimes obviously because I was a teenager and would have desserts and stuff but still. \n\nBut now it's so annoying.

1589,edabc,t5_s5o7i,"After having my son 2.5 years ago I lost a lot of weight and was mentally struggling with body image/calorie counting/over exercising. I started having issues with passing out frequently and was diagnosed with a couple cardiac issues and was told my body fat percentage was extremely low which was contributing to the cardiac issues. I saw a couple different therapists and was told I had anorexia, but I have a hard time believing that still. With Covid my gyms closed and I just wanted to feel normal again, so I stopped calorie counting and allowed myself to gain some weight back - I maintained that weight (middle of a healthy BMI) until I got pregnant again. \n\nI had my daughter 2 weeks ago - she came early and she fought for her life. She was extremely sick and had a 50/50 chance of survival in the beginning, but she is doing amazing now and will be in the NICU for a couple more weeks and then we will finally be able to bring her home. \n\nThis situation was extremely stressful, knowing my daughter may not live was the most horrific thing I have ever went through. I couldn’t eat or sleep for days, and even though she is doing much better now I cannot seem to get back to normal eating again. \n\nI just don’t know where to go from here. I can’t decide if this is a normal reaction to such a stressful experience, or if this is becoming an issue that needs addressed. I don’t want to make a huge deal about it, but my husband keeps saying how worried he is that I’m harming myself by not eating (I am eating, just not more than a couple hundred calories a day). \n\nComplicating factors: I am a nurse practitioner in the NICU where my daughter is getting cared for. My information pulls into her chart as they are connected. My colleagues see this information and I’m a pretty private person. \n\nMy colleagues and the nurses are starting to notice my rapid weight loss. It’s obvious to people it isn’t normal postpartum weight loss. I’m embarrassed when people bring up my weight or size - sometimes they are complimenting me snapping back to a normal size, but I can tell others have concern behind their comments/questions. Colleagues are asking me if I’m eating - I know they mean well, I just never know what to say. The social worker is concerned. \n\nI have an OB appointment this week and part of me wants to tell her how much I’m struggling, but I don’t even believe I had an eating disorder before so I don’t even know how to explain why I’m concerned now. I also don’t want anything about this documented in my medical records as it will be visible in my daughter’s records, which as an NP or MD we read on a daily basis. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. I think I need to figure this out on my own, I’m just embarrassed and struggling.

This is even more so because of how little I've seen people because of the stay-at-home order in my state.\n\nBut I've been so depressed this past week, I've been so touch starved because no one in my family is interacting with each other because everyone but me has to work, and I don't want my brother to touch me when he does because I don't want him to notice my weight loss. All the COVID-19 news is getting to me, I'm afraid my family will get sick because they're working, and I can't go to my usual group therapy because the conference call app just doesn't fucking work.

1631,expectohallows,t5_o3plh,"Happy Easter peeps! I hope you're enjoying your chocolate eggs and cakes!\n\nI want to write a few things about extreme hunger in recovery. First and foremost - it's temporary! You must tell yourselves that at all times and learn to believe and trust the process. It happens because the body had been starved for so long that now, when food is allowed, it aims to get as much as possible. It's a tiny helpful evolutionary trait that keeps you alive. The thing with that is that your body, in a state of shock such as restriction, does not know why the food is not available - it thinks it's some sort of emergency, like in big migrations, wars etc. So once it's there - all the foods now!\n\nThat leads me to this scary-seeming thing that looks like binging but it's actually not. It's called refeeding and is a normal reaction to drastic weight loss - the body wants to be healthy and happy and it knows food is the way to that. Bodies are smart like that. This is a temporary phase and it stops once the body knows the food will be provided at all times. This is why you need to honour both physical and mental hunger - if you restrict now, the process will take longer and be more difficult to cope with.\n\nThe weight gain that comes with it at first is definitely water and bloating and whatnot, but also a sign of damaged metabolism. A healthy body does not gain after a few extra cookies and pizzas, the healthy body regulates itself. As you keep eating your way through the first stage of recovery, your metabolism will speed up and the weight gain will peter out. Once your body is at its own healthy weight, it will regulate hunger and you'll stop gaining. You cannot control this weight, but I can guarantee you it will be healthy and definitely not fat. Also the weight will first go to your stomach - this is to isolate your organs, and this will later redistribute and even out. \n\nPersonal experience - my refeeding took a few weeks, and really, there were no restrictions whatsoever - of course there were bad days and insecurity and pain and discomfort, but still I persisted. I was weight restored within the second month and got my period around the fourth. I even overshot my setpoint weight, because I kept eating a lot to jump-start my period. Once I had it, I started listening to my hunger cues more and lost the extra very soon and the rest of it redistributed nicely around. I was happy with my life and body and I would wish you all the same!",1617562989,Why binging in recovery is not a thing - Extreme hunger is smarter than your ED,"[0.005904150654479444, 0.142084305906814, 0.16435068709054676, 0.08503010646255198, 0.028667923643625755, 0.24099650874218134, 0.19955217667783962, 0.02558519694706487, 0.056470129567294206, 0.05135881430760209]"
1632,expectohallows,t5_o3plh,"Hello guys, I hope you are doing well! \n\nI'm a long-time recovered anorexic, but I lurk around here in case I can provide some help to anyone who needs it. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to address something that is so often asked and feared - the math of calories. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn recovery, you must eat a minimum of 2500, ideally 3000kcal per day. Before you scream in panic and start shooting at me, I want to write about why this is necessary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off, a general guideline is that an average person needs about 2000kcal per day, with moderate activity, to be healthy and functional. \n\nHowever, this is not enough for those in recovery because their bodies have much more work to do. It's not just about functioning and barely living, it's about all the energy that is necessary to rebuild your muscles, organs and bones. Restriction weakens all of those and will lead nowhere except for an early grave and that is a fact. Also, hormones are heavily subdued in restriction, and i'm not talking only hunger and fullness cues, think mood, fluid control, digestion, periods and heat regulation. If the body doesn't get enough food, it will shut down everything it can in order to keep the heart going, and I swear, life will break your hearts in many ways, but you don't have to contribute to this by not eating enough. This also means that the weight you gain is NOT FAT! And don't let your ED tell you otherwise, not now, not ever. A damn lot of it is water retention, and as a menstruating person who suffers from it every four weeks, I do know it's not always a nice sight - but it's damn normal and it means nothing! It's just air and water. Also, muscles and organs weigh too, so does the improved bloodflow. Nobody ever got fat in recovery, and if you were to google success stories you would see for yourselves.\n\nIt is necessary to eat a lot in order to bring bodily systems back online and this doesn't last forever either.

Any feedback or support would be great, I don't feel comfortable talking about this with my support system in real life so this forum is super helpful.\n\nSo, my partner gets pretty upset whenever she thinks I'm losing weight or restricting. Which obviously is very stressful for both of us. For context, I'm not underweight or anywhere close, never have been, and my physical health is good. I often don't agree with what my partner notices. For example, she says I look skinnier, and gets mad if I turn down food. So the next day I weigh myself, and I'm the same weight as always. I tell her that, and she gets upset about me weighing myself, and says she doesn't believe that I am actually the same weight.\n\nI feel confused, like I can't trust either myself or her on this stuff. I know my ED causes skewed perception, and there have been plenty of times in the past when I didn't pick up on disordered stuff until I was already sliding into a relapse. However, once I catch it, I always bounce back. But also, I do think she overreacts at times.\n\nShe says she has a tough-love approach because I need to know my behavior isn't good, and that she won't let it slide. She thinks that my ED stuck around so long because my loved ones ignored or implicitly approved of it (which may be true idk).\n\nI've told her that these conversations aren't productive and I need autonomy in my recovery. She sees my request for autonomy as wanting to distance myself so I can engage in ED behaviors again. She is afraid that I will choose my ED over her. It came out recently that her anxiety comes from seeing trusted people ""transform"" in the past due to addiction or mental health issues, and put her in danger or hurt her (literally).\n\nAdditionally, she struggled with bulimia for a while in the past, and recovered on her own through basically a ""tough love"" mentality towards herself. When we talked, she understands our situations are different and we're different people, but I guess she has that ""if I can do it, so can you"" mentality a bit.\n\nFinally yesterday I think she started to see that she needs to address her issues, too. We started reading this book about helping a loved one through recovery from addiction (but a lot of it could apply to an ED too). The book mentioned several things on both of our ""sides"", so I think we both felt like it was proving us ""right"".\n\nI'm hopeful that we're getting closer to supporting instead of fighting each other, and being a united front against both of our issues.

But I was still visibly and publicly mentally ill in a lot of ways...not cute ways. Crying, screaming, constant breakdowns, over things that were objectively not a problem. I got in fights. I was missing my eyelashes, eyebrows, and most of my hairline. At times I had self-harm scars.\n\nEveryone knew there was something wrong with me. And, in general, people aren't that kind to those with mental illness.\n\nMy family blamed me for making problems. Other adults wrote me off as seeking attention and being spoiled. My peers ignored me, or talked shit behind my back. The school admin people suspended me and semi-forced me to take medication to come back. The only people that still liked me were my teachers, because I was good in class, and a couple of friends who were going through similar ordeals (although I didn't know it at the time).\n\nI was fucking ashamed and embarrassed 100% of the time. I tried to hide my behaviors as best I could, but it still crept out, or certain situations would push me to the edge. I was told I was being a bad role model for some younger kids, and that hurt so badly...I loved them fiercely and wanted to be supportive and positive for them.\n\nI felt less than a person. I carpooled with these 2-3 other girls. When we walked to the car, I walked behind them. I sat in the back. They didn't look at me or speak to me the entire time. We drove together every day for 2 years, just like that. Sometimes, they ""forgot"" me and I waited for an hour in the snow.\n\nThe times when someone *was* actually kind to me were so powerful and painful. I will remember those moments forever. Then, I actually started to heal after a friend told me he was going through similar things with an ED, and I finally had someone in my life who understood and didn't judge me. I had other friends open up about self harm and problems with mental health and suddenly I felt like a person.\n\nWhenever I see someone who's clearly going through it, like a stranger who's screaming out loud on the street, I feel for them. Because I've been there. I don't know why they're feeling that way and maybe they don't, either.

1661,foodintolerancelife,t5_o3plh,"Hello! Basically, I’ve been on recovery for the past few months but it was only recently that I really increased my food intake. I eat nutritious home-cooked meals, do not consume dairy, sugar, etc. anything which could be seen as acne triggers. I have had hormonal acne in the past due to my PCOS, but I handled it through changing my diet (which is actually what triggered the ED for me whilst giving me clear skin, which sucks majorly). Anyway, I still eat the same foods from back when I had clear skin, just more of it, so I don’t think it’s being triggered by food (my skin is very reactive to my diet).\nI also skipped my period last month but did have some minimal spotting for 1-2 days on a random day within my cycle. My period had already been late for a while at that point. I’d been on birth control prior to recovery for 7 years, so I did have “periods” up until 3 months ago when I finally got off the pill. It is possible that my body wasn’t actually able to have periods the entire time I was on it due to how underweight I was, I just never thought about it because BC or not, I did bleed every month...\nMy question is, I don’t know if these things are related at all, or if anyone else has had their skin freak out on them during recovery? Perhaps it’s my hormones trying to balance out? I am constantly eating (every 2 hrs) so maybe it is the constant rise and fall of my blood sugar levels causing this. Or it has nothing to do with recovery and everything to do with my PCOS. If anyone could enlighten me on this situation I would very much appreciate it. Having acne again is triggering my BDD pretty bad, it feels as if all the torment I put my body through just to reach clear skin (extremely restrictive diet for the past 4 years, cut out entire food groups in order to find the culprit, developed orthorexia alongside anorexia, which is why I am in recovery in the first place) was all for nothing. I can’t help but feel like the moment I was finally able to eat normally, my skin was like “Haha! F you!” and reverted to how it actually was before all of this. I have deprived myself of too much, and I can’t seem to come to terms with how possibly pointless it all had been. Thank you in advance to those who reply!",1601314202,Skin freaking out during recovery?,"[0.01141277647556951, 0.12836063148327614, 0.09705536453444773, 0.016380212818491755, 0.010843923503476953, 0.3157688696868343, 0.2659538404339866, 0.007512943042816056, 0.12644879676352103, 0.020262641257579962]"

Why should the recovery process have to be so long when my relapse was short?\n\nMy dietitian gave me a starting meal plan but I feel I have no accountability outside of my parents and a big part of me starting to restrict was about me not liking when they tried to dictate what I could eat. So I've been restricting as much as I can using the meal plan portions and what I have in the house. I can follow the meal plan and eat much less than I was eating before so I feel like I have to. I don't know why. My behaviours were all about restricting my calories. And the meal plan doesn't address calories or give me a minimum.

I was tired, anxious and incredibly uncomfortable eating in front of others. Then in music I became very very anxious (just a background, I sing classical/opera and am a soprano. I want to be a performer and have been training for the past 7 years.) when two girls who have been known for being obnoxious and a bit unkind, started laughing. I was practicing with my teacher and I hit some hard notes. I’m pretty certain that I was clean and fine when singing them. However, I kinda overheard the two of them screaming at the top of their lungs, basically making fun of me because I sing classical and shit. The worse part is one of the two was in my class last year and was pretty nice to me, and I kinda thought we were friends, if not just friendly towards each other. \nAnyways, basically the one thing I’ve had going for me is performing and singing, and I’ve always felt a bit uncomfortable with the fact I’m the only person I know my age (I’m 16) who sings classical.

I for one dont know who I am without it at this point. I think I’m not sick enough for help if I eat a meal.\n\nBestie, we need food to survive. If you’re in school, you need food to not fail. In the words of the great cinematic masterpiece Ratatouille “Food is fuel. If you’re picky about what you put in the your tank your engine is going to die.”\n\nIf an addict is clean for a couple days you don’t tell him “ok no more rehab for you, you have this under control”.

They would say i looked fat, or i had some visible weight gain as a joke, but then i wouldnt eat for 1 day or so to ensure I wasn't getting fat. \n\nI just feel like my brain won somehow, and i don't know what to do anymore.

I won’t get them for myself, but I won’t totally shy away eating with others. I’m at a lower weight for my height, but healthy. My period is regular. I don’t have a calorie goal I need to stick to or I’ll freak out. Pre-quarantine I had a “ball park” knowledge of numbers but didn’t obsess. I could go over a certain “relaxed/ presumed maintenance limit” and not freak. I would sometimes miss meals/snacks but it was often a scheduling thing. I still don’t exercise outside of normal walks, because that’s the recommendation of my team.\n\nIn quarantine, I’ve restricted more than I used to, but I still don’t have a hard set goal. I’ve had a number that my ED likes in my head, but I don’t freak if I go over it. I haven’t lost weight (that I know of, I very sporadically check, and I actually prefer not knowing). I’m more aware of calories, and in the last week I’ve averaged at or slightly below a common dieting number. Again, if I broke that say today, I wouldn’t freak, because I know it would be fine. I guess this is all to say I don’t think, or well, ever thought restriction was “bad” for me. Most of my ED I was at a normal weight, so how bad could it be if I’m not experiencing side effects?

So it's the same weekend except now it's my friend saying things to me. So I am currently overweight but I've also been thin and did not get thin via healthy means. So anyway... this friend of mine invited me to visit her, she knows my mental health has been really suffering lately and actually encouraged me to make my trip longer than I intended (I thought like maybe three days she suggested a week).\n\nIt's the last day of my trip and she offers me a piece of cake. It was from my birthday celebration, and I'm like yes! And then I asked if she'd have a slice of cake with me and she was like ""It isn't even noon!"" And I was like, ""Oh be on vacation with me!"" And she was like ""I don't indulge on vacations either. Actually, the last vacation I was on, I lost weight."" And I was like, ""Good for you that's awesome!""\n\nMeanwhile internally I'm like, I shouldn't have said yes to this f\*ing cake because now I feel disgusting, and I'm clearly her fat friend.\n\nSo then she starts lecturing me about losing weight and basically says that I'm lazy and that's why I'm fat and I eat too much sweets and I have no self-control. She said a bunch of other things too... and now, my flight is today. It's too early to leave, but I'm about to cry so I just say ""Do you want to just take me to the airport?"" And she says ""Yes. Let's go."" And doesn't say another word to me the whole 45 minute drive to the airport.\n\nShe hasn't texted me or tried to communicate with me in any way since. And now my mental health is even worse than it was before I went to visit her.

Since my last relationship ended a few years ago and friends moving away and disappearing into family life etc etc since I’m in my thirties, I’m more isolated and I emotionally eat much more. \n\nWFH during the pandemic, I am much more isolated, and I emotionally eat pretty much every meal, every day, when I’m on my own. Food calms me down and regulates me. Eg I had a bad dream; breakfast helps me calm down. Stressful meeting, lunch helps me calm down. Breaks without food do not have the same effect. \n\nTo damage control weight and health effects, I volume eat and count calories and I can do this and stay at the higher end of a healthy weight range for my body. \n\nI’m going through old stuff at my parents’ house and there are notebooks from when I was anorexic as a teen. Half a dozen or so notebooks with meticulous calorie counts/food logs. It’s so sad. \n\nLately, even before this, I have the sense of just wanting to be free of worrying about calories etc. Free of the whole thing. I think intuitive eating could be that pathway, and honestly I’d weigh less eating intuitively rather than stress-based. \n\nBut - then what about stress? I’ve been in therapy most of the time since I was a kid. I’ve done self-help books etc on codependency, depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia. I’ve done DBT. \n\nAnd still - the most effective thing I can do for myself to regulate is binge and purge. The second most effective is distract while stress eating. Maybe my nervous system is just really fucked from all my early trauma.

Right now I'm doing really well and I'm pushing myself a lot, but I'm doing it because I actually want to be normal. It's very new territory. \n\nI've always really hated being told I'm doing well or that I'm looking healthier. I can't fully explain why but I know it's a common thing with eating disorders so hopefully someone gets it. I feel like it's partly just an identity thing, like for a long time it was the thing I was extremely ""good"" at. I also have a lot of issues with being seen as physically attractive, I've been the victim of sexual abuse as a child (and an adult) which is pretty much the entire reason for my eating disorder. And like... idk, I've never felt that I'm deserving of being healthy so being told I'm looking after myself better makes me angry with myself. \n\nI never thought I'd get to a point that I'd feel ok with looking good or looking ""healthy"" but right now I'm noticing that when certain people point out that I'm doing well or looking good or whatever, it kinda makes me happy? I'm not talking about just random people in the street obviously, but like my partner, certain friends or colleagues, when they make those kind of comments I'm noticing myself feeling a bit proud of myself. \n\nIt's extremely new and it's freaking me out slightly now that I've noticed it, part of me is thinking ""ew no, you don't get to feel proud"". I'm trying not to go down that road, though it would be extremely easy.     \n\nI dunno... can anyone relate to this?",1672231272,"Reaching a point in recovery that I've never been at before - feeling ok with looking ""healthier""","[0.0058496547326623, 0.0023213000530869486, 0.03822731553315632, 0.01501949327657982, 0.0007130051403603268, 0.04493991181567634, 0.8530476402922772, 0.03457914646363969, 0.000568283224949183, 0.004734249467611966]"
1810,hug-a-cat,t5_s5o7i,"Some questions before I start rambling about my own shit: \n\n- How do you feel about groups? Do you find them helpful? Unhelpful? Terrifying? Did you voluntarily choose to attend or did you have to be dragged kicking and screaming? \n- Have you had any particularly positive or negative experiences you feel like sharing? Or any truly outrageous experiences (I have many but I'll spare you)? \n- What type of group do you prefer (e.g. do you prefer a very structured one that's run by a psychologist or do you prefer a mutual aid group that's run by other people in recovery)? \n\n\nSo basically I'm quite interested in finding some kind of support group, not necessarily ED-specific because the ED is just one of MANY issues I struggle with. Plus I've never really had any positive experiences of ED treatment in the past so something with a more general topic might work better for me. \n\n(I did actually try to go to a recovery support group quite recently but the facilitator hit on me so I never went back. Literally a scrawny, dead-eyed gay dude with knots in my hair and paint-stained trackies, chewing the skin off my hands and avoiding all eye contact - how could she resist!!) \n\nI used to HATE any kind of group when I was younger, but a service I work at now runs a few different ones which I've observed and I can see how it's helpful. I think if I found the right option it could be really good for me. I'm doing pretty well overall but sometimes I really feel like I'm white-knuckling it and I'm just one bad day away from fucking it all up. I usually prefer not to talk to people I'm close to when I'm struggling with something because most of my shit is really dark and I don't like dumping that on someone who cares about me. I feel like a support group would be more detached (obviously I still wouldn't go totally wild and trigger the shit out of everyone but I feel like I could potentially be more honest that not everything is peachy). I do have a one-to-one counsellor still and she's great, I find the one-to-one stuff so intense and uncomfortable though and I'd like it if the focus wasn't just on me. I like supporting other people which I could do in a group. \n\nI have a bit of past experience with groups and it was all pretty crap tbh, which I think is partly due to me being a little shit who didn't want to engage, but also because some of the groups weren't a great fit (e.g. there's a lot of anorexia-specific stuff I don't find at all relatable despite that being my diagnosis) and some were really badly managed. I've found that ""mutual aid"" stuff (e.g. NA, SMART Recovery, etc) can attract quite predatory people which I've had issues with in the past and it makes me nervous about trying again. I think I might handle shit like that better now especially because I'm in a stable relationship. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience or advice they feel like sharing? I'm very open to recommendations too, though it would need to be either online or available in London (tbf I feel like most things are available in London...) I'd definitely consider an ED one (or one about another of my issues e.g. ADHD, complex trauma, addiction recovery, etc) but I reckon something just about recovery in general would work better for me.",1671634468,Does anyone have any good/bad/interesting experiences with support groups or group therapy?,"[0.12049760925817891, 0.01196855669157331, 0.0658843491418338, 0.07603623028586481, 0.0005278610714234022, 0.005937096942632532, 0.6520391678610835, 0.035850097516763935, 0.00042071869473763655, 0.03083831253590822]"

It was a diner populated heavily by the elderly and famous for having the best pie. I can’t remember what I ate previously that day but I remember ordering some type of club sandwich because all of the salads looked horribly unappetizing and cheap. Obviously it shouldn’t matter anyways. It came with a small french onion soup. I ate a lot of bread and crackers that were complementary, devoured my soup, but could only peck at my full plate when it arrived. I could feel my stomach stretch against my dance leotard and shorts. My body felt bloated and horrible and I wanted the food to be gone and at the same time let loose and eat as much as I possibly could as I was at a restaurant, something that happens not too often because of how poor I am. I opened up to my mom about how I’ve been struggling lately with my eating. I want to restrict so bad. I am, but not as much as I would like and still maintain my binging habits. I don’t like talking to my mother about these things, for a multitude of reasons as you might find out one way or another, but I was in such a needy position I needed to tell someone how I was doing, hoping to be met with comments saying that they have noticed and are worried because I am losing weight (I didn’t get any).\n\nThere is no point in telling about our brief and lowly conversation so I am just going to jump to the bit when we are in the car, on our way to drop me off. My mom brings back up hospitalization and I say that I don’t want to go back. I’ve been on three separate occasions in the past 8 months all for depression, anxiety, and then ED. I get upset because I feel like whenever I struggle my family just wants to throw me back in.\n\nI chew on a tooth pick from the restaurant and, after some silence, say “I’m not going back. I don’t even look sick.”\n\nWith my last words my face contorted into a horrible figure and I started to sob like a child, the tooth pick hanging limply in my mouth. My mom parks in the usual spot and listens to me scream and sob for a good 10 minutes straight, without any words. I tell her that I feel horrible. I’m not anorexic. That is my main fixation. I remember screaming and crying at the ED program that “I get an eating disorder and I can’t even lose the weight. I get the one that makes me ugly. I wish that if this was gonna happen then I at least got the one that would make me beautiful. I couldn’t even do that right. I couldn’t even lose the weight.”\n\nI restrict and binge and eat normally and cycle through it constantly, tearing myself apart from the second I wake up to the very last moments before I go to sleep.\n\nMy mother tries to get me to go to dance and tells me that it will make me feel better but I won’t stop screaming and shaking and crying. I can’t remember how long its been but my mom gets me out of the car and I can’t even walk. My legs hurt and tingle and my mom has to hold me up and escort me down the city to the building.

1836,ilovecrabrangoon,t5_2ydy9,"My cousin who is much younger than me recently opened up on social media for how she has had an eating disorder for several years and was hospitalized due to the severity of how dangerous it had become for her. The sadness I feel for her is overwhelming. I understood everything she had talked about in the post and related to everything she was talking about. It’s now even making me remember memories I’ve completely forgotten about, of times where our family consistently ALWAYS talked about her weight, ALL the time, even throughout her entire childhood. It’s very painful for me to think about what she’s gone through, knowing what it’s like to have an eating disorder, because imagining her going through the same thing is so awful and what she actually did experience was so much worse. \n\n\n\n\nMy sadness and sympathy for her trumps everything, but what I also feel deep down and know I can’t ever share with another person is jealousy. I can’t even really grasp what exactly it is I’m jealous of and I can’t  even comprehend how I can be jealous of ANYTHING in her situation when I understand how awful her situation is and the reality is she is incredibly sick and suffered a horrific amount. I can’t bring myself to even look at the pictures of her where she’s lost so much weight knowing what she went through, and I’m disgusted with myself because I’m also honestly jealous of how thin she is, and I hate that I feel that way. And I know how fucked up that is which for some reason doesn’t cancel out the feeling and I feel awful. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides her physical weight, I’m honestly jealous of the attention she will be getting now. I thought about how our family will see her post and maybe reflect on how they projected their fatphobia onto her throughout her whole life, and before I could even think about how it could be a moment of progression for them &amp; a change for the better in how they’ll treat her I was consumed with jealousy. I know that’s horrible. I keep thinking about how they have always made me feel terrible about my weight and the way they infused my eating disorder. I know this shouldn’t bother me but it’s haunting me that they gave me her old clothes from before she had lost weight and the comments they made about how I was basically getting her “fat” clothes (they didn’t use that word but they were very passive aggressively implying it) I am disgusted with myself all together. I shouldn’t even be thinking about myself during HER struggle but I also can’t stop it. I hate myself for being so triggered by my cousin opening up about what she’s gone through.

Because he was seeing how I saw myself and how much I hated myself for my weight. \n\n\nThat’s the hardest part for me to get through. The guilt.

1844,iluvchikins,t5_2tmc8,"This is something very close to my heart. I posted about my ""journey"" last week, but after giving it some thought and reflection I figured id share some more. \n\nI tried stopping a year ago with no luck. I tried listening to lectures with hard facts about EDs and the neurology behind it, but even that couldn't stop me. I understood that EDs stem from desiring control, but didn't know what to do with that info. \n\nThe single best piece of advice I can give is to journal. Make a to do list about things within your personal life, even the smallest things (have to make a phone call? schedule an appt? school assignments? write it down!). I forget where I read it, but checking stuff off of a to do list releases some dopamine that could potentially replace the satisfaction that bulimia gives us. \n\nAlso, reflecting on your own ""journey"" regarding bulimia or history of EDs may help as well, as if you're leaving it in the past, moving on from this era. \n\nI'm 16 days in recovery. Every day counts. I've started using my time constructively (making art, journaling, reflecting on my day, writing a to do list for the next day or for the week.) If you don't accomplish something on your list the next day, that's okay! Add it to the next day. don't beat yourself up. sometimes I procrastinate, but knowing I need to get that done in order to have a clear mind helps me want to get it over with. \n\nI also advise keeping a clean area to have a clear mind- I feel that my space is a reflection of my mental health. \n\nSome advice for journaling:\n\n\- if you have to clean, break it up into parts, it makes them seem much easier! (rather than ""clean"", write ""put clothes away"" ""take trash out"" ""sweep"")\n\n\- write down people you have to contact, assignments to complete; if you have to write a paper, write ""write paper for \_\_\_\_"", it makes everything feel much more manageable having these tasks broken down to their core =)! \n\nArticle about to-do lists and dopamine: \n\n""The psychology behind why we love completing to-dos"".

Ed trigger warning!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nI grew up in a really health conscious home, which unfortunately meant a lot of unhealthy and negative body image rhetoric being pushed to me. I think we all know here that diet and fitness culture contains a lot of negative and disordered ideas, even if that isn’t their intention. I also was the only one in my family who was overweight, as my parents were super into fitness and my brother was naturally thin, so I just had a really negative self image in general. I felt like I had to restrict or eat things that were within what my family saw as acceptable from a super young age, which led to me really wanting the foods that were “junk food”. \nI got bullied so often in middle school and high school for my weight. I won’t say exact examples of things people told me but some of it was really really awful. It all sort of came to a head when I had a boyfriend who was treated me horrible in every way. He told me a lot of horrible things about my body and just perpetuated my existing body issues. In fact he made them get so so much worse. I purged for the first time while dating him because of something awful he said to me about my body I remember after I was finished just being so scared that I had just started something awful that would never ever go away (I was right) \nAfter we broke up I resolved to never let that happen to me again, and promised that I was going to lose weight. That’s when the severe restricting started and I lost a noticeable amount of weight. Rather than being concerned all my peers who had made fun of the way I looked were now complimenting me and just enabling me in general, same for my parents. They were so proud of the way I looked. As we know tho restricting can’t last forever and I would tell myself I was “going to try and recover” and eat whatever I wanted, and immediately feel horrible and purge. I’m literally still in this cycle and it’s been years. I’m so tired. I restrict and restrict and all my attempts to recover end up being a binge/ purge episode, or sometimes I just purge after trying to eat something I’m scared of. It’s like once a week I binge and purge or just purge after heavily restricting the entire week. Sometimes I’ll try and eat a fear food as an attempt to get better and I just end up purging it because I can’t do it. I have tried everything. I almost don’t want to recover because my fear of gaining weight is so immense. I don’t mind restricting, the idea of eating and then losing control or just not being able to stop myself from purging it after overthinking what I ate scares me so much. It feels like I spend life worrying about my body, how I look in what I’m wearing, if what I ate is “too much”, if I should just binge and purge now because I ate a fear food and I “already ruined it”. It’s just horrendous it feels like hell, but holy shit I DO NOT want to gain weight man. I went to dinner with my family for a celebration tonight and ate what I actually wanted off of the menu and didn’t purge for the first time in years but I sat in the restroom on my knees contemplating it for a good 20 minutes. I have no clue how I’m going to overcome this if I don’t even want to get better. I know that today was a huge step but I felt the need to still do a little workout after and spend some time alone just cleaning and distracting myself while staying somewhat physically active. At least I didn’t purge though. I have to go to ANOTHER celebratory dinner tomorrow and I’m freaking out because I already ate something “””scary””” today and don’t wanna have to do it tomorrow just to give an example of my thought process and what evoked me to even ask for help here in the first place. \n\nI have told my parents on many occasions (I live with them) and they both said they’re tired of me bringing it up and that I should “just eat” the classic line I feel like we’ve all heard LOL. But they are basically of no help w this. I have one friend, a co worker who’s about 3 years older, who is actually totally recovered from the same issue but talking about it isn’t something she’s willing to do yet and that’s completely fine, I would never push her. Other than those 3 people nobody else knows and I don’t really have any other people in my life besides them. \n\ndoes anyone have a similar story to share or any advice?? it’s all welcome just rlly struggling as of late and nobody in my life really knows too much about it, so any kind of support and interaction is welcome!!!!

1879,its_givinggg,t5_rbmui,"So over the weekend I saw a post on here talking about the ketogenic diet and expressing frustration with people trying to push keto onto people.\n\nAnd I do get being annoyed and upset at people who are on keto trying to push keto onto everyone they come across. Especially as people who are trying to recover from harm done by restrictive eating behavior.\n\nI admit I’m guilty of this myself, especially because keto has helped me reverse my BED which is caused by insulin resistance by overconsumption of carbs, in relation to the metabolic disease I have, PCOS. So I do tend to recommend it to people who have the same issue. \n\nBut some of the comments I saw on that post were just plain mean and nasty for no reason.\nI don’t think it’s fair to be made fun of or called “orthorexic” for how I have to treat this disease. I don’t think it’s fair that ED recovery only centers eating without any sort of calculation or restriction when it may be necessary for those of us trying to recover from BED.\n\nSomeone on another post mentioned that there seems to be a hierarchy of ED’s within recovery communities and it seems like BED recovery is at the bottom of the totem pole, simply because BED recovery doesn’t always look like recovery from other ED’s. \n\nFor one it should be common sense that treatment for restrictive ED’s such as &gt;!ana/bulimia!&lt;  is going to be different from recovery for excessive consumption disorders (aka BED)\nas they are both on the opposite side of the behavioral spectrum. So this idea that the only type of valid ED recovery is recovery that centers moving away from &gt;!restriction!&lt; is a very narrow minded and myopic viewpoint of recovery, that only seems to center restrictive ED’s, with no room for analyzing recovery from BED.\n\nI get that there’s a smaller portion of us who suffer from BED than there are ppl who suffer from ED’s that cause &gt;!restriction!&lt;, but we still matter. And our recovery shouldn’t be painted with the same brush as recovery from restrictive ED’s. \n\nIt’s already bad enough that there’s such little support for recovering from BED, but to see folks looking down upon and labeling those of us who have to use very different methods for recovery is hurtful.\n\nIf you read most peer reviewed studies and medical guidance for treating both BED caused by insulin resistance in relation to PCOS and other symptoms of PCOS, you will see overwhelming support of centering certain foods and &gt;!eliminating/restricting!&lt; other foods. And no, that’s not the result of wanton diet culture infiltrating medical treatment.\nWe have legitimate proof that the &gt;!restriction!&lt; of certain foods when you have this disease makes dealing with the BED and other symptoms caused by this disease easier to deal with\n\n\nSo automatically declaring all of us who have used keto/monitoring our carbohydrate intake and yes, &gt;!RESTRICTION!&lt; (dun dun dun) of certain foods to help treat our binging and other symptoms caused by this disease as “orthorexic” and calling what we eat nasty and chiding us for not being able to “eat normally” and “care free” is mean at best, and dare I say ableist at worst. Some of us really don’t have a choice. \n\n\nI understand that the concept of using restriction to treat an ED sounds oxymoronic or dangerous to most “normal”/able bodied people who suffer from ED’s that cause restriction, but this is how disability works sometimes. ED recovery for most able bodied people usuallt centers moving away from restriction and towards eating whatever and not being afraid of any type of food. \n\nMy ED recovery as a disabled person with a metabolic disorder that leads to binging includes &gt;!restriction!&lt; of foods that make my binging and other symptoms of the disease I have worse. It’s as simple as that.\n\nThat doesn’t make me a freak or orthorexic, and it doesn’t warrant me or any others who are in the same boat as me being put down or made fun of for not being able to eat without &gt;!restriction!&lt;\n\nPlease don’t take this post as the promotion of keto or any other form of restriction. That’s not my goal here. I should be allowed to detail how it as helped me fond relief from my BED without it being interpreted as promoting the diet.\n\n\nI’m really sorry but there has to be some balance… there’s no need to shame or label those of us who have used diet change to help with our ED’s, the same way there’s no need for those of us who have made changes to our diet to shame other people who don’t wish to make the same changes, and find those changes hindering to their recovery. \n\nLet’s all be kinder to each other please. \n\nI’m sorry if this wasn’t appropriate to post on here but I don’t know where else to say it. If this is a “bad” post I’ll take it down.

Like, a car accident luckily no one was hurt and I was not cited.\n\nMore specifically, I have been working extremely hard to repair the damaged relationships over the course of my binge eating and fitness obsessed phase of my life. It did more damage, than I can show you. Which brings me to this. On Sunday May 21st I am going to start doing some live Periscope sessions. This is a video chat phone app, anyone can tune in.

In know the feelings and frustrations. I can empathize with you because I was there for years; thinking that this would never end and I was doomed to live a miserable life. This is NOT true, you can live the life of freedom you envision, yet seems so unrealistic!\n\nI am dedicated to teaching strategies that give YOU this freedom! YOU this freedom! No more fretting about going out because you are afraid of an eating disorder, that food is ""unclean"" or that you will wreck all of your results. No more doing so BS training programs because it is the only way to get fit or be in shape. No more wasting money on supplements that you don't need, are of poor quality, and are a flat out lie.\n\nThis is not some get results quick scheme. I am a person just like yourself. What would you do if you could save yourself a couple hundred dollars a month or gain an extra 10 hours a week? Would you go out more with a significant other, learn a new hobby, play with your kids or grandkids. The possibilities are LIMITLESS and I am here to show you how!\n\n“I can’t believe it,” I thought to myself. I had just left a family Christmas party and was not sick from binging nor did I feel the need to punish myself for eating cookies and drinking beer. At that moment, I closed my eyes and smiled realizing the massive journey that began in 2011.\n\nIn fall of 2011, as my days of playing high school football began to wind down, I sought to lose weight. I was always fat growing up, but I played offensive line so I accepted it and just lived my life ignoring the teasing. Skipping all the fights and excess details, because my fat kid story is like all the rest.\n\nThat didn’t always work, I would find myself in many detentions for fighting with other kids. I was the typical fat kid, I ate everyone’s lunch growing up because…well mom wouldn’t buy that contraband, also known as twinkies. I worked at Dairy Queen in high school too, people talk about the freshman fifteen in college. Well, they should try the DQ 50ish.\n\nHowever, once football ended the desire to lose weight was much greater as there seemed to be no logical reason to keep it; plus I just started dating this gorgeous girl (way out of my league). So, in the fall of 2011, things began just like everyone else who looks to lose weight. I started to lift weights and do cardio after school. I also began to watch my diet, even a single carrot was an improvement. As the weight loss progressed I became more obsessed with vanity in myself and my physique. The pendulum swing had begun, I went from being a kid who would eat every edible object in a room (including some that weren’t if people were not looking) to someone who you thought was training for the Mr. Olympia.\n\nThe transition did not take place overnight, in fact it happened so slowly and gradually that I did not notice the self-centered monster I was creating. As I soaked up information online from bodybuilding sources, I learned about “clean” foods, meal prepping, cardio, and the works. As time progressed, I became more and more focused on my vanity and physique.\n\nI was spending easily in upwards of 40 hours a week, a “full-time” job on my body and it was not because I enjoyed it, it was simply because I wanted abs and the claimed “physique”. I was doing 30 minutes of fasted cardio every day, then I would lift weights 5-6 days a week followed by another 90 minutes of cardio, and lastly my caloric intake was 1800 calories (mind you I am 6’-0”). If you don't believe me watch this or see that.\n\nTo make matters worse, when I did sneak a homemade cookie (deemed “unclean” food by the food gods....damn you!), I would just throw my hands in the air like, “Dang it James! You will never have those abs by eating this quote dirty food!” Thus, since mentally I thought I wrecked all past progress, I would proceed to consume all the cookies, a box of sugar cereal, ransack the cupboards for any other source of sugar. Within minutes to an hour, I would consume the caloric intake of a small village. The cycle would then proceed to be placed on repeat like your favorite new song, that never seems to escape your head, except this song lasted 3 long years….restrict, restrict, binge, restrict, restrict, restrict, binge… and the song SUCKED!\n\nDuring this time, I was trying all kinds of supplements because I thought that was the key to success that I so desperately needed. I could have been admitted into rehab as an addict for supplements. I bought every damn one that was sold protein, creatine, thermogenics, mass gainers, test boosters, pre-workout, etc. I probably boosted Bodybuilding.com’s bottom-line by about 10% during those years. I believed every hyped ad that would read/claim, “add 600% to my bench press” or “get abs in (insert insane short amount of time that is way to unrealistic…unless you’re as gullible as me)”. Still no results though….how could that be?!?\n\nI would then sit down, cry and sulk in my room, thus proceeding to punish myself for these unacceptable results like a toddler who threw a toy at this brother. However, my body had no more to give, but I did not care….I WANTED ABS!!! So, I pushed myself harder and the world further away, more cardio even less food. Oh, and also James no going out with friends or eating at family parties because the food is not up to par for you and your abs.\n\nThis would repeat itself every weekend for several years with no end in sight. I tried IIFYM which morphed into If It Fits Your Mouth, I was scared that if I ate a reasonable amount of “normal” food I would blow up and all of my results (which was not much because my body was dead from the diet swings) would go away. I sought help and nothing seemed to work; was this ever going to end?! I thought about grabbing the Remington 870 in my room, loading a deer slug and just end it right there…..\n\nWas there a special moment or turning point for me? No, just as slowly as it seemed to happen, it took me just as long to fix it and I am still not perfect….it is still a thought, but I have found several ways that began the transition and what I do now to conquer my inner-monster. I am still not perfect; it’s still something I battle. I now use it as a joke…I powerlift for pancakes or do deadlifts for doughnuts and other similar silly/stupid phrases to play off the love of food and iron.\n\nThis journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want to help other learn from me. Late in 2014 I created my YouTube channel to share my story and these lessons. As of February 2016 I just began publishing videos about the story I detailed above. It took me some time to get the self-confidence and courage to talk publicly about it. Most men, don’t dare to talk about eating disorders even though it’s prominent in the fitness industry due to the promotion of unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyles. I first heard of this issue with women in bikini and figure competitions from Layne Norton, so yes it’s seemed girly. Since, no one else wants to be blunt and upfront I will. I have been teased and ripped up, but I am still standing so not much will phase me at this point.\n\nMy channel is small nothing crazy about 60 subscribers and most videos get about 10-20 views within a month of the upload. However this video almost reached 100 views in a week (that’s a PR..PRs are not only in the gym but life too!) and the amount of emails, friend requests on MyFitnessPal, questions, and the skype calls have occurred quicker than I ever expected from total strangers. I will continue to publish more details about my story in the time to follow and answer questions. I am currently in the process of opening a website (the one you are reading) and blog to help others more directly than via YouTube.\n\nIn addition, to sharing the “tricks” I learned to kill my binge eating monster and not myself. My first lesson was on supplements: what I learned from research and my experiences. I created a ranking scheme to help explain my point:\n\nWorth The Money\n\nWorth The Money If You Can Afford It\n\nMarketing Scam…RUN!\n\nI also began to only support serious supplement companies. Like 1st Phorm, ones that are reputable, they create honest products, they don’t spike their numbers, and they actually represent what the hell fitness is meant to be. Too many companies are about making a quick buck off the ignorant and uneducated (i.e. ME). They promote fitness as this vanity thing, like abs are the key to happiness. That people with abs are better than you. Let me tell you…that’s crap!! Fitness is not about looks, it’s about changing who you are from the inside...not the out. After this whole experience, I stand by that claim!\n\nI am now proud to say I am a USAPL competitor because I FREAKIN love it, not because I want to be strong or look good (I am over that). Lord knows, if I didn’t love it then I am not squatting, benching, and deadlifting four days a week at five in the morning. I have also made the successful transition to an IIFYM lifestyle. I have not prepped a meal in over 300 days and counting!\n\nThis industry has changed me…for the better (finally). I used to be the laziest kid as evidence by my fat slothful (called husky to be polite) youth. Now, I won’t be outworked by a soul. I am dumb or crazy enough (depends how you look at it) to chase my crazy dreams and have experienced some success since learning about my full potential through powerlifting these include, but no limited to:\n\nSumma Cum Laude B.S. Civil Engineering, Spring 2016 \n3 Different Business Ventures Under Construction \nPancakes &amp; Powerlifting \nWolf of Scholarships (teach college students how to win scholarships…I won 50K) \nStructuralMD (small business with a professor and 2 friends) Learning to Trade Stocks Part-Time…why because I love to learn a new challenge\n\nI am here to teach you these lessons and have a positive influence, I don’t want you to kill your opportunities like I almost did.

No, just as slowly as it seemed to happen, it took me just as long to fix it and I am still not perfect….it is still a thought, but I have found several ways that began the transition and what I do now to conquer my inner-monster. \n\nKeep It Simple Stupid\n\nLove yourself. Simple right? Perhaps the worst thing about this cycle was I hated myself, I hated my life, I did not want  to look in the mirror, I thought I was a failure that I would never make it, I contemplated suicide. When I would binge, I would punish myself. Don’t do that we are human, life is meant to be enjoyed. Life is much too short to never treat yourself to what you love to eat whatever that maybe for you. Again Keep It Simple Stupid. Look yourself in the mirror directly into your eyes saying “I LOVE myself” at least 10 times a day, if not more. P.S. try not to smile when you say this (harder than you think).\n\nYou can eat whatever you want just not all at once. I believe I heard Layne Norton say this, I believe this, like the 11th commandment, in fact it should be an amendment to the constitution. When I first began to escape cycle, I would eat one “treat” at every meal. Nothing crazy, but it will allow you still get your “fix” but you won’t binge on it. Any action in the right direction gave me more motivation and encouragement to keep in proving. The small wins kept snowballing into large victories later that slammed the door on binging.\n\nGoing along the line of K.I.S.S, I did this with my meal planning, no more crazy spreadsheets and tracking of nutrients line item by line item like an accountant. I did not worry about counting calories and the works. I would instead eat (3) meals, breakfast, lunch and supper possibly a snack if I was hungry. I would eat slowly, and as I began to feel fuller I would stop eating. My metabolism was so out of whack that the slightest improvement had drastic results.\n\n180, 190, 160, 225, 200…what number was it going to be today I thought I as I closed my eyes scared to look down at the scale after a night of binging (these were all weights I reached during this cycle). You do not need a scale to help you. It’s about small wins, small wins, they add up trust me; I have been there too.\n\n\nSo, what about eating at restaurants and parties? Parties were my kryptonite, the amount of food that I saw and I thought I had to eat three people’s worth of everything. What helped me to win at parties was I made this a game in my head (who cares no one else knows..plus now you know I did it). I am very competitive; I hate losing even if it’s go fish with a girlfriend (I will be a terrible father I will never let my kids win). Since eating slower and not getting seconds was a struggle at first. The game I created was to be the last one done eating, and the last one to get seconds. This helped me in many ways, first to help me eat slower I talked with people, this helped to repair the relationships I had damaged in the past, plus I was not over eating (win/win). Which is why I was last to get seconds, so often I would eat so quick that my stomach didn’t even know it was fed until I was already 4-5 plates of heaping food deep.\n\nTrain for fun! For so long in this process I trained for results no I do not mean goals; I simply worked out to look good that’s it! It was the complete wrong direction, it made training no fun, I dreaded every gym session, and was having a miserable time. It doesn’t matter if you are into bodybuilding, figure, physique, cross fit, powerlifting, strongman, marathons, etc. just train for fun, train to get better and challenge yourself. For me this was powerlifting.\n\nI began to cry happy tears as I feel asleep. This journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want you to learn from me, because those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it. I ruined my relationship with friends, missed out on memories, lost a girlfriend, and almost my life. You are a winner you can do this, I believe in you.\n\nIf you could please email me at jahillegas@gmail.com with your thoughts, comments, questions I would greatly appreciate it!

1898,janeadoe,t5_2ydy9,"Lately I have been disgusted with food and myself, as I know I gained some weight (although that weight is completely invisible to other people, it’s just my dysmorphia fucking with my brain).

I was a lot more unaware of my habits, and was sort of anorexic by accident, meaning: I didn’t not eat on purpose, but more so just experienced a loss of appetite due to mental health, combined with a lifetime of disordered eating habits that I had never questioned prior. In April of this year is when I finally admitted to myself that I have an ED and have always had one, or even multiple… that’s also when I became even more obsessive over my food intake, started counting calories and micro-managing every single thing I put in my body.\n\nAnyway, what is so weird to me is that I was way skinnier-looking last year, when I was eating whatever I wanted and not counting calories whatsoever. Compared to me now, trying to lose the weight on purpose and seeing food in numbers, for some reason my face has gained weight and I generally just do not look as sunken and chiseled as I used to - not that it is a bad thing, it’s just weird to consider. It makes me wonder if I would feel and look better if I stopped counting calories and just returned to whatever I was doing before. I was underweight, yes, but I felt and looked better than I do now. I guess there’s a difference to being underweight on purpose and by unaware “accidental” habits. \n\nDoes anyone know why even though I didn’t gain that much weight, seemingly my face just isn’t as chiseled anymore, at least to my eyes?

And, in my mind, the early quarantine lapse didn’t cause much damage, if any (I don’t know where I started, so likely it could be a normal fluctuation). In a shocking turn of events, it didn’t have me running and screaming to behaviors. \n\nMy therapist made it seem the number I saw WAS the danger zone. When I tried to say “but it’s normal,” she challenged that. I’ve been with my team for a very long time and they believe my set point is higher than where I’ve been, which makes sense. I have cut corners a lot pre-quarantine due to, well living a normal life. Pre-quarantine I had my 9-5 and another 30 hours a week booked for a side gig. I genuinely was busy. The further I get away from treatment, the more “normal” I think I am, and the more I subconsciously use behaviors.

Was all of those behaviors for the first couple of weeks pre-quarantine not a huge concern as it was, and were the treatment “threats” (it wasn’t that harsh but I can’t think of a better word) unwarranted?

I’m struggling to be honest with my partner about it. I’ve made vague statements, but I’m scared to say, “if I can’t pull it together, I have to go back to treatment.” It would be easier to do in person but with shelter-in-place I can’t.

I changed careers for various reasons (some that are being amplified and publicized today), but now I feel guilty. I worked in an ER in Manhattan. I’m petrified for them. I know they’re strong af (I survived and learned through a natural disaster with them; badass, brilliant, and so fucking up to the task), but it’s still just volume and trauma.

I try to be supportive and I’m super fucking lucky right now. I can’t imagine what it’s like. I felt bad having an out loud anxiety attack while she was home (otherwise I would have been losing it out loud to the void) because the panic was something stupid about my cushy job at home.

I went from restricting extremely low (no numbers) to ordering out with my husband. I knew I was scared because I said, \n\n'We gotta do this fast before I change my mind.'\n\nIt was a large meal. I ate my main course (a large burger), a handful of the side, and even a couple of the appetizer. Shortly after, I threw up, and my face and fingers started to go numb. My speech started to slur, and I was confused, weak, and dizzy as heck. \n\nAfter laying on the bathroom's cool tile floor for a bit, I decided to go to the hospital. \n\nThey kept me for HOURS trying to get my electrolytes balanced, and watching my heart for arrhythmia. They took multiple things of blood, and wouldn't let me drink any water (for fear of me throwing up more). My pupils were dilated, and my hand-eye coordination was off particularly my left. \n\nAnd I was diagnosed as having refeeding syndrome. They got me situated, back and balanced, and sent me home close to 2 in the morning. My husband wouldn't sleep. He came to get me.  \n\nI think I have finally accepted, despite all the evidence stacked against me, that I have an eating disorder. I know that sounds so stupid but I have accepted it. Despite doing all the things I was doing, despite seeking therapy and the clinic, the tests, I still thought, I'm too old for this. This can't happen to me. \n\nIn spite of the late night, the burger, the refeeding syndrome, the doctors...\n\nThis morning I still weighed myself.\n\nStill.\n\nAnd for some reason, that seemed the most important part, the most important thing I do... Before I ingest anything, before I drank any water, after going to the bathroom, before I was fully awake after sleeping in... \n\nI weighed myself.\n\nAnd as I was leaving the bathroom, it was like a small little switch that just clicked and a quiet thought said, ""You're mentally ill, you know that, don't you?"" \n\nAnd I answered aloud, \n""Yeah, I know, thanks.""\n\nLike I didn't need reminding, but for some reason I did. And I don't know if that's my 'authentic voice' or my 'Ed voice' mocking me. But that's also something my mother has said to me before. So who is it? Is it Ed? My mother? Or is this just how I deal with things? \n\nIt's strange, because I have days where I accept that I'm sick, and others where I just don't. Like it's not real. It's not there. And then other days where I realize I've forgotten to do something, because my thought are FILLED to the BRIM with 'what can I eat', 'when can I eat', 'i have to open/close my window at this exact time', 'how many calories was that', 'i look fatter than yesterday', 'i can't eat that because it's not on my safe foods list'...\n\nI took two appointments back-to-back with my therapist and we thought it was silly because what would we talk about?\nSo I have an appointment today.

But Ed isn't a person, it's my mother all up in my head. My doctor warned me my hair would fall out if I carried on this way, and so I stopped briefly, but it wasn't enough to keep me from carrying on. \n\nI'm just... Feeling depressed and ugly right now. Fourteen weeks. That's three and a half months to find out if I'll even get accepted into this clinic. So much can happen in that time that I worry by the time I get there, my hair will be falling out in chunks. My mother is supposed to visit May 13th to see our new place. What if I have a bald spot? Wear a hat? I don't even own a hat.\n\nWhen my husband got home, I burst into tears about my hair and how even though I love my hair I can't stop.

She was aghast, but has suggested some grounding techniques. Instead of zoning out and making my meal a 'I just need to fuel my body and get this over quickly', that I shouldn't disassociate from it. That I should try to pay attention to my eating, and try to enjoy it.   \n\n\nShe also calls EDs, ""Ed"", like a person. Like a man, talking to me in my head, about how I need to follow these ""rules"" that ""he's"" put in place for me.

1942,kaliedoscoping,t5_s5o7i,"So like, I’m sure many of you all know anorexia makes you eat GROSS foods. Plain prepackaged tomato soup, one slice of bread toasted, folded in half and dipped into it was always my easy 150 calorie dinner. It‘s comfortable. It doesn’t make me anxious.\n\nMy partner [24M] knows I [21F] struggle with EDs and he’s SO supportive and amazing, but there’s a lot he doesn’t know about anorexia in general. He’s working from home rn and we’re basically living together so eating every meal together, and he always tries hard to cook really good meals for us….which are definitely NOT my safe foods. He respects my dietary restrictions, lets me watch him add every ingredient so I know what’s in it, barely uses things like oils, asks me what I want to eat every night….but I’m too embarrassed to tell him what I can handle on a given day is sometimes fucking packaged 100 calorie tomato soup and half a piece of bread or noodles with 20 calories in a package. Sometimes I cook too but I’m not about to subject him to that weirdness either so I just end up making really good, really anxiety-inducing food. Ugh. \n\nUsually I eat and just portion control extremely strictly but it makes me so anxious and I just feel sick and fat and bloated sometimes for no reason after meals when “real” food is too much for me emotionally. Or WAY more embarassing I’ve gotten REALLY into c/s….like we make cookies together, we both snack at them, they overwhelm me, I don’t want to just throw them out, so when he’s in the shower or outside I fucking c/s them into the sink and immediately act like I wasn’t when I know he’s coming back. I think he thinks I’m eating more than I am because of that and he’s super proud of me and I don’t want to tell him it’s all a lie.\n\nLike once every couple weeks we spend a night apart when he has to be home for errands etc and I always get so excited to eat the weird safe foods I have hidden away on the top shelf of the front closet and then I get SO excited to comfortably eat something I just binge my safe foods. And then I see him the next day like always and I feel….fat and bloated from binging. Oh gee. I have never, ever been a binger until now and uh….it sucks. \n\nI’ve gained weight since we’ve been dating and I don’t really even have an issue gaining weight — I was medically super underweight when we first started dating a few months ago and gained very slightly and I’m short so it makes a huge difference, but lately I’m plateauing because I can’t handle it. I would love to gain weight but I hate the way eating food makes me feel. I fucking hate the feel of being full. It makes me feel disgusting. He’s so understanding and NEVER pushy about the fact that I can barely ever bring myself to have sex anymore and tells me all the time he loves me and does not care or mind and I know he wishes he could help more. But the only thing that can help that feeling is not eating at all and I can’t just keep doing that, I was dying at the rate I was going at before and I will not let myself slip backwards, even if I’m not able to move forward much right now in recovery either. \n\nAnyway we’re getting our first real apartment together in 3 months and I’m hoping I can get out of this cycle before then because I LOVE his cooking and he is SO supportive and it SUCKS that there’s no way to explain that sometimes I just need to chew food and spit it into the sink because my ED’s wining today.

1943,kaliedoscoping,t5_s5o7i,"(Long post, possible body discussion TW) I grew up pretty average, I could eat anything I wanted and stay around 5-10 lbs larger than I wanted to be (I’m 5’2”) and recognized that but never really dieted or anything. \n\nI was never close to anyone with an ED and didn’t have any idea what they were like; I’ve always struggled with OCD and being hyperobsessed with certain aspects of my appearance, but I was small enough that becoming skinny wasn’t my obsession, more things like my skin, hair, and teeth.\n\nA couple years ago I had a roommate who had struggled with anorexia for years, and was open about it. She was small and she’d been in and out of inpatient for years. We became really close and she talked to me about it, and a lot of different things. I started to become aware of how we were the same height, but she was much smaller — and she always passed up soda or a second piece of pizza, so I should too, right? Towards the end of our lease she relapsed very badly and went to inpatient, and through private social media (finsta etc) I saw all sorts of documentation about it — how thin she‘d gotten, how she met other cool people in treatment, and it all looked very glamorous.\n\nI love her and I don’t blame her at all but it changed me forever. I’m obsessed with my own weight. I’ve dropped so much weight. It’s been years and I have learned to maintain almost comfortably but I’m very underweight, visibly extremely bony, and I recognize how bad I look but I can’t stop. I can’t gain. I’m stuck here.\n\nI’m moving in with one of my best friends in a few months and all I can think is that even though she’s never talked about experiencing an eating disorder etc, I’m scared that the fucked up way I treat myself will rub off on her. I was debating moving in with some other girls recently and one of the big reasons I didn’t is because I know one struggles with her body image and I suspect may be battling an ED at its early stages and even though those things don’t really affect me anymore, I don’t want to be the one who negatively affects others like this. I’ve become the extremely thin person who passes on everything good and eats so strangely and so rarely and I don’t want anyone to glamorize me. I lived with my mom for a while recently (who I know had an ED well back in the day that she claims to be fully recovered from) and she would always look at me like she was terrified of me. She’d watch me eat. She’d put her own fork down. I got to the point where I exclusively ate in my bedroom so I wouldn’t trigger her.\n\nI hate it too because I’m bi, leaning towards gay and I don’t flirt with or date women anymore because I don’t want to trigger them. I don’t say that narcissistically, I don’t look beautiful. I look disgusting. Strangers have actually asked me what’s wrong with me when I wear leggings or anything form-fitting in public. I look like an anorexic’s dream. And I hate it. I hate the idea of being someone else’s trigger. \n\nI’m tired of keeping people at an arm’s length because I don’t want the horrible way I treat myself to rub off on them. I get to live alone until January and in my eyes that gives me seven months to heal and develop a better relationship with food. I get to learn how to treat myself well, become comfortable with gaining weight (hopefully get my period back at some point, something that’s been on my mind for a while), become okay with eating food people other than me have prepared, drink a glass of wine without frantically weighing it and googling the calories, and, honestly, eat. I’m excited because I have a built in timeline of working on some of these behaviors but I’m nervous too: do I REALLY want to get better? I don’t know. But I DO know I am tired of my ED getting in the way of my life. I’m tired of not being able to join in on any physical activity because I’m too frail.

But I'm back because things are going downhill again.\n\nI was diagnosed when I was 11 and when I was 15 my doctors said I was at a point where I no longer needed medical attention for my anorexia.

I had a so-so nutritionist for a bit at the beginning, and I have a therapist, but she's not great for this (currently looking into other therapy options, but it'll likely be awhile before I can change). Other than that, recovering pretty much alone.\n\nI've made really good progress on physical, tangible changes. I did mechanical eating for ages (still do, when I need to), have reached my goal weight, and can do a lot of things physically I couldn't previously. I was sensing that I'm still not doing great though, because if I slack off eating really well for just a few days, I start having fairly severe symptoms again (blood pressure problems, dizziness, hair falling out, etc.). \n\nSo I was trying to look up more intuitive eating, in case I was finally ready for that (my therapist wanted me to get there at some point). I found an IE exercise where you list 10 foods you crave, and then mark off the ones you actually let yourself eat. I almost didn't do it, because I told myself i don't restrict types of foods (I definitely was one of those ""I don't have a disorder"" people for years,  and even now I still tend to downplay it). But I REALLY thought I didn't do this. I did the exercise though, and realized I only let myself eat three foods on the list.\n\nBeen thinking a lot about this, and it's made me realize I've been very focused on tangible, physical changes but not so much on changing the mental aspects.

1966,kayethx,t5_o3plh,"Hey all! I've been making decent progress in my recovery, and I've been slowly trying to add some physical activity in, partly to help counter my depression and anxiety (and also because I'm naturally happier when I'm doing more athletic things - it makes me hate being in my body a little less, because I really focus on the cool things my body can do vs. what it looks like). So far I've been sticking to long walks every morning and some very mild yoga routines.\n\nI'm having to do a lot of my recovery without being very monitored by a doctor or nutritionist, unfortunately, so not sure who to ask about this. But I found a place near me with boxing lessons, which is something I've thought about doing in the past and have gotten more into lately. When I saw this was available, it was one of the first things in months to make me feel a spark of excitement or happiness (I've been in a really, really horrific depression phase lately, and very few things have made me feel anything good). Plus I really miss being as physically strong as I was.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is too much while still underweight/working hard on recovery? A few months ago, I was doing poorly enough that my heart rate was jumping like crazy if I as much as stood up, my body temp was dangerously low, and I got dizzy constantly (a big part of it is because I restrict liquids too as a self-harm thing - most my anorexia is a depression-fueled self-harm thing - so I'm often dehydrated and my blood pressure is low because of it). I'm still not drinking great, and occasionally get dizzy, but it's much, much better than it was.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to tell when it's okay to add more in?

Did talking to your parents about it help with recovery or made things worse?\n\n\nI'm not sure how my parents would react if I straight up tell them I have had an eating disorder for 13 years.\nThey know something is wrong but they never put 1+1 together. With no support system, I keep failing at getting better. As soon as I reach a certain ""forbidden"" (healthy) weight and I have to go up a clothing size, I relapse to heavy restriction and exercise and/or vomit my meals. When I lose the weight, extreme hunger hits and although I still purge, I gain those 5kg back. It's all a cycle of gaining and losing the same amount of weight for years and years.\n\n\nI've reached a point where I realise I don't want this to kill me, I can't stand purging anymore and when I restrict I eventually lose my period. Although I miss my -5kg body, my adult brain knows I shouldn't weigh less than I did when I was 15 years old. My eating disorder is my coping mechanism for everyday stresses (which get more and more serious as years go by) and I know for a fact I won't get better without proper help. I live alone currently and my ED has taken full control of me, but I'd still often b/p when I stayed over at my parent's house for a month\n\n\nHowever, my parents are old and don't understand mental health. My mom has been struggling with disordered eating every since I can remember but won't ever admit she has a problem. I've been dropping more and more hints and today she asked me over the phone if I'm actually bulimic to which I said no (like the liar I am) because sometimes I'm in such denial I won't even admit it to myself. That's mainly because I keep switching from months of restriction to months b/p. Although I don't currently meet the diagnostic criteria for anorexia, my weight gain was due to extreme hunger so I still feel like I'm anorexic, just living in a fatter body. I do binge, but purging doesn't give me the high it used to give me when I was bulimic some 5 years ago. I hate doing it and it's always the result of prolonged restriction.\n\n\nI don't want to make them worry but also I don't want to keep wrecking my body for the rest of my life. I know parents usually find out when we're still young, but as an adult it's not only embarrassing, I'm afraid of the consequences it will have on their mental health. I don't even know if telling them will help me or if it'll make me feel more guilty and trigger my eating disorder even more.

Now I get home from work and exercise for an hour + then cook dinner because I can’t trust my fiancé to cook and then it’s practically time for bed, I’m too exhausted to try to stay up late to get shit done. My mom was a nightmare growing up but she paid for treatment and held me accountable. Now I have no one to hold me accountable and if I wanted to get more treatment than seeing my therapist 1x a week then I wouldn’t be able to because I’d be the one paying for it and I have no money for it. I hate my teenaged self I had no clue how good I had it, I’d give anything to be able to get away with behaviors without all this physical side effect shit.

Eating in front of people that aren’t my fiancé, eating at restaurants, and eating filling food are all extreme triggers for me. This Saturday we’re going to a restaurant for a family members birthday and everything there is huge (literally they have a burger called the fatty melt). With the help of my therapist I’ve started a list of how to get through Saturday without purging. So far on the list I have:\n\n-exercise (a healthy amount) before going to relieve stress\n-drink plenty of water \n-get something I’ll actually enjoy and eat half of it but get a healthier side so I don’t feel so guilty and tempted to purge \n-do “stopping skills” &amp; stop, relax, think before we even leave the house to lower my baseline of anxiety\n-reality check and repeat a mantra to myself\n-go for a stroll after dinner \n\nIs there anything that helps you when you have an overwhelming urge to engage in behaviors?

2031,lazyfrazey,t5_o3plh,"Hello! I have been in anorexia recovery for about ten months, weight restored (according to the BMI) since November so about five months. I'm trying to eat as much as I want when I want and definitely feeling much better in many ways (WAY less irritability which is the best part of recovery so far, more in control of my emotions, more rational, less stress). However I am still struggling with depression and resentful, self-isolating moods. It's not every day, but it's hard to shake when they happen. I get stuck in critical, negative cyclical loops of thinking about friends and family who I feel have abandoned me even though they haven't really. I have come to see this as part of the anorexia; it wants me to feel isolated and like nobody loves me. It actually manifests as an actual sentence in my head: 'X doesn't care about you or love you,' when I know that isn't true at all in the moments I am feeling well.\n\nI'm sure that I am still in the process of my brain taking the new fat from my body and healing, and I know this is going to take a long time. I guess I'm just wondering when roughly I might be able to expect to start just having a streak of days, weeks, months without a turbulent emotional/mental health state. It can literally be in a matter of minutes I have crazy mood swings. But it is improving a lot so I am confident it will one day completely go when I make a full recovery. I also know this is different for everyone and, of course, Covid is a difficult experience for us all so I'm sure that's having an impact on my mental health and recovery process.\n\nAny insight into what this may have felt like for anyone else further down the line of recovery would be much appreciated.

2032,lazyfrazey,t5_o3plh,"Hello everyone. \n\nThis is a question I have been thinking about for a while. For all the 14 years I had my anorexia eating disorder, I never identified a voice in my head. I can look back and say that I certainly had a very strong FEELING about things, which was actually anorexia's voice impersonating my own thoughts, feelings and opinions. But after my diagnosis and during recovery I started to hear a very clear voice in my head sometimes. The voice would literally say things like 'It's me and you, isn't it?' and 'I'm still here, I haven't gone anywhere.' Someone once said 'Anorexia is literally evil' and I wanted to shout 'No it isn't, don't say that about anorexia!' I can see now that was nothing but the voice of anorexia speaking for me.\n\nThe more I eat and the further down the recovery line I get, the less this voice appears. I believe that when the blanket was ripped off anorexia through my diagnosis and treatment it had nowhere to hide any longer. It couldn't pretend to be me anymore, so the voice became clearer.\n\nI was wondering how the anorexic voice sounds for anyone else? Has anyone else experienced it as a clear voice with words, like I did? If so, what are the situations this occurs in? Or is it mostly a very strong feeling you have, above all?\n\nMany thanks in advance and good luck in all your recovery journeys.",1613405029,What does the anorexic voice sound like to you?,"[0.028245607099335074, 0.004347982779477514, 0.19262396843474852, 0.002199630027481825, 0.0013355163059781863, 0.023665533181698246, 0.5259259409702972, 0.18579065265129915, 0.0010644404512286645, 0.034800728098455656]"

But around a year ago I was super morbidly obese, had been steadily gaining for years, and one day I guess I just decided that if I didn't digest my food then I couldn't gain any more weight. \n\nAnd I didn't. I stopped gaining and started losing and because of the fact that I was obese, I was congratulated on my weight loss. Since then I have maintained my purging habits with some periods of restriction but always with a return to binge/purge cycles. I've been losing steadily ever since and am now at a normal and healthy weight. And honestly? I've never looked or felt better about myself. \n\nI guess there's not a ton of point to this post. But I feel like since I developed my ED as an adult, willfully and knowingly walked into it, and feel healthier and happier than I ever did before I developed it that I'm somehow faking it or it doesn't actually matter. I wrote this pretty quickly so I hope it all makes sense and that some of you can get where I'm coming from and not like I am in any way advocating for unhealthy behaviors.

2067,literallunatic,t5_s5o7i,"Long story short, I’ve been struggling with a restrictive eating disorder for just over a year. I moved home for Covid, and my parents have been helping me work through it. It’s a long journey (as you guys know), but I really feel like I’m making progress.\n\nThe issue is, when I moved home in the throes of restriction, I was also heavily into powerlifting, and so persuaded my parents that my food habits related to “training”. I showed my dad MFP as he was interested in what I was doing, and he downloaded it as he was interested to see how much he was eating. It and a fitness tracker definitely gave him a project during lockdown, and I think it gave him better habits for a while; for example he switched his packet-a-day biscuit habit for grazing on fruit. \n\nHowever, he has now lost a dramatic amount of weight, and I see ALL my behaviours in him. Suddenly going on a ridiculously long walk at a weird time when he hears what’s for dinner/logs what he’s eaten; eating 1/3 of what he used to at a meal and claiming to be “stuffed” etc. Literally the exact behaviours he yelled at me for when my parents first noticed I had an ED last year, and the behaviours I am still desperately trying to break myself of. \n\nI think I could handle it if he would admit we share a problem, and be open to help and criticism as I am. However, he utterly refuses to accept he’s any different to how he used to be, despite now being gaunt and boney where he used to be healthy, and spending 3-4 hours a day walking/at the gym. Worse, whenever I try and broach the subject, he instead claims I’m restricting again/looking skinnier/trying to kill myself, so that my mum cries and I lay off. This is so painful when I am working so hard to recover, in a large part as I know my ED was destroying them. Being undermined so he can hide his own ED is pushing me towards relapse, as is seeing the amount he moves vs the amount he eats. I also feel wracked with guilt that I’ve done this to my healthy father, who always had a decent relationship with food and exercise, and since my ED was rooted in self-loathing and guilt anyway, this is also pushing me towards relapse. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I have no idea what to do. It is destroying my mother to see him this way, and she’s already been wrecked by what I’ve done to myself.

I just felt so paralyzed. She's been asking me to go to the hospital for awhile now. She says I need electrolytes, I need someone to take care of me.

I ordered some sushi.

She said I don't look so well, I look like I'm not eating much, if I've been to the doctor. I told her I missed my doctor's appointment the other day and had to reschedule. She said, ""Go sooner. Or to the hospital. You need medicine and food, you are having trouble eating, it's dangerous. Your body is probably very sick,"" on the way out she got close to me and said, ""Please come back soon.

My brother was not in a good mental and physical state, and I became super worried for his wellbeing. I focused a lot of that energy on to him and my eating disorder used it as an excuse to neglect myself. \n\nI've had Anorexia Nervosa Purging Subtype (with Laxatives and Exercise) for about ten years. I've been underweight for years and had no room to lose. At first, I just lost some of my appetite naturally due to busyness and fear. I was traveling a lot and being pretty active, eating was just in the back of my mind. \n\nI was eating a lot of meats and vegetables, and naturally realized that I was consuming less carbohydrates than usual due to accessibility. I decided with my spare-time to begin reading all about the benefits of low-carb diets, joined a Discord, next thing I knew I was completely indoctrinated. This was going to improve my health. It isn't just for weight loss. It can improve insulin levels, reduce anxiety, be good for digestion. It's just so amazing!\n\nSo I began.. lots of wings, and salads, than I learned about the sugars in barbecue sauces, next rice was bad, then dried fruit... no more juice. It was like just taking every food I was safely able to eat away from me. \nEventually I just became petrified of even taking the wrong bite of something. Like, debilitated with fear. Just awful. \n\nI've lost so much of my appetite and enjoyment for my life and my family. I'm so exhausted. I've lost weight from it all. My dog Lucy died making me even sadder and all I want is to feel okay. The keto-groups are so toxic. One time I fainted and they scolded me for eating a piece of bread after fainting, saying I should've had a keto-option on hand. They blame everything on American food addiction and assume everyone is obese, diabetic, or has a history of binge-eating. Their dialogue surrounding people who eat carbohydrates and who are overweight is so evil and cruel. I hate them. \n\nYesterday I ate pasta. I had convinced myself that I was allergic to it and that, like this group told me, I'd experience bloating of 5-7 pounds INSTANTLY along with severe inflammation and pain. After a portion I felt full. My weight was the same this morning. Nothing bad happened. They said I'd binge and lose control due to sugar addiction but I didn't.

I'm not in high school, I'm a grown woman who goes to school, has worked, and has other responsibilities to attend to in life besides my eating disorder. I have Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Purge Subtype by definition, and when we met I strictly restricted. When I met her I refused all food, I was in and out of hospitals with feeding tubes, all that crap. Now I do all the grocery shopping, I cook, I eat over 1200 calories per day, but I do struggle with maintaining a healthy weight and deal with laxative and exercise abuse. I don't binge but I do engage in compensatory behaviors that honestly I try to keep private from people outside of my family and a few trusted friends because a lot of people just don't understand anything beyond starving, vomiting, whatever they've heard eating disorders are. \n\nSo my friend wanted to hang out this week and even though I literally cook dinner almost every fucking night for my family, go out to eat with them, all that shit, she makes everything about food.

She asked if I wanted to go out to eat or do something else and honestly with buying groceries and my car payment and my college tuition lately I'm not sure if going out to eat would be ideal because it does cost a lot of money that I could use towards groceries for us or my car or whatever I need, but I do want to hangout. I just don't want to spend a ton of money, you know? So I said hanging out at either of our houses is cool with me honestly (I can make myself food where ever I am, I have food at home), and she said the dumbest shit. She said she likes to go out to eat with me to ""make sure that I'm eating even when we're hanging out and not sacrificing my health hangout."" I understand the thought but she's done this a lot where she'll just randomly ask me if I'm eating and crap and it makes me feel super triggered by old feelings and like I'm being watched for how I eat?

2121,makeupyourworld,t5_s5o7i,"Hi. I have Anorexia BP subtype, mostly purge. I eat about 1000-1300 calories per day, walk 10,000 steps unless I feel like I'm on the brink of death, and struggle with severe laxative addiction. When I say severe I'm talking Diuretics, Senna, and about 80 Dulcolax stimulant laxatives per day. It has reached a point of no return where I am vomiting/gagging constantly, losing blood when I use the restroom, fainting, I am so dehydrated that the skin on my lips and hands are peeling off, and I have ulcers throughout my digestive system and cardiac imbalances due to my electrolytes. I didn't always abuse laxatives. I had AN Restrictive Subtype for 6 years, than suddenly became addicted to the stimulants. Prior to my stimulant use, I was on prescribed laxatives and stool softeners (Miralax and Colace) to help with regularity when eating and drinking since I would experience constipation. I was not experiencing any of the severe ulcers and fainting like I am now. \n\nI have had enough and so has my mother. She is very concerned for my life and thinks realistically I cannot ""wean myself off"" of stimulants because in an anxiety-ridden panic I'll end up taking too many and getting stuck in the cycle. She knows the dangers of laxative abuse and about blockages and is making me see a GI specialist. She believes in the meantime I can not continue taking stimulants, and that to avoid blockages and severe constipation, I should just be taking Miralax and Colace in order to aid the digestive process and keep things moving enough while stopping the dependency. Yesterday she did not allow me to take any stimulant laxatives (basically watched me like a hawk) and gave me one Colace (stool softener) and a double-dose of Miralax. It was the first night in many months where I have not woken up in pain and vomiting, although I was still dizzy, but I feel uncomfortable because my scale is showing that I gained a bit over a pound yesterday (still in my typical underweight range - BMI is in the 12/13 range so I am really anxious). To be honest I'm beyond petrified of not being able to go to the bathroom. I was able to go some this morning so I guess I'm not technically constipated but I'm really scared. I was wondering if anyone else has ever beat a severe laxative addiction by using Miralax and Colace and been able to prevent severe intestinal distress. \n\nI'm sorry for the TMI. Eating disorders are embarrassing. Is my mom right in this case? Will Miralax and Colace help me enough to use the bathroom safely or do stimulants actually make me lose a lot of weight.

She put lots of emphasis on how her friend never claims to be hungry, has thrown up in the bushes, and how her mom follows her to the bathroom. She also made sure to let me know about 10 times that her friend like ""lost some weight but like still probably weighs more than her."" I said if her mom is supervising her bathroom use she must be aware on what's going on, also made it clear that it doesn't matter if her friend is ""not that skinny,"" she'll still die of a heart attack or tear her esophagus from vomiting so yeah, it probably is a big deal. \n\nShe has asked me if guys think I'm hot because I'm so skinny from my ED.

And then she said ""No, like fat people with bariatric surgery,"" and I gave her a whole schooling about how people in good hospitals should be being monitored by doctors and on medical diets depending on their needs. She just kept making fun of fried food and fat people in the South to the point where I went completely wild and told her that she seems to have a problem with fat people and an obsession with controlling other people's size or diets and that if she wants to eat a certain way nobody is stopping her but she (ACTUALLY NOBODY) has no right to judge people based on their weight or what food they eat and to mind her own f***ing business. I told her hating fat people isn't a cute personality trait that I want to associate with, point blank. It was beautiful. 😅\n\n""Let's be real, you brought up bariatrics. Weight gain. Bagging on specific foods and cultures. \n\nGrapes are not goldfish but eating only grapes isn't gonna sustain someone either. Neither is eating only goldfish.

I do not have depression or experience suicidal thoughts, ideation, persistent sadness, loneliness, etc. I enjoy doing activities with my friends, social gatherings, spending time with family, I have interests and passions- I overall enjoy being alive. The thing that sucks joy out of my life is my anorexia. \n\nWhen I'm not eating, I'm tired. I can't socialize or do activities because I'm exhausted. I still have the desire to do all of these things, I'm just not able to. \n\nMy PTSD also affects me. I get night terrors. I am *very* alarmed by loud noises such as doorbells, yelling/loud voices, being touched/hugged unexpectedly. These things trigger my flashbacks and when my PTSD symptoms are more severe my eating disorder symptoms heighten. \n\nI have tried a variety of psychiatric medications - upwards of 15. These have included Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Luvox, Prozac,  Risperdal, Olanzapine, Seroquel - I know some of these are antipsychotics or anxiety as well but I have had negative reactions to every single one. Lexapro had me so tired I couldn't function, one of them caused vaginal infections, one of them caused violent/psychotic/disoriented behavior. During my time on these I was extremely suicidal and since I've stopped taking them I've had no thoughts or attempts. Part of my PTSD has to do with being drugged without consent/permission so I have a major fear pf psychiatric drugs because I was drugged to the point of being in an incoherent state for an extended period of time.

Last night I went to sleep and woke up at 5 am and started throwing up really badly and violently for like an hour and was in a lot of pain and than I drank some Gatorade and went back to sleep. This morning I got up and had a cup of juice and started gagging again, than I went in the bath and after a little bit my hand started spasming. It's usually my right hand or right leg.

2127,makeupyourworld,t5_s5o7i,"So last week I wrote about a positive appointment that I had with a cardiologist. I have anorexia and was very happy with the care. The doctor went over my symptoms, diet, vital signs, EKG, and determined that I may have a circulation condition that he'd like to assess further and started me on medication to raise my blood pressure. The other specialist that the hospital referred me to was a GI specialist, because I deal with *severe* laxative abuse and have ulcers throughout my esophagus and colon. I would like to safely come off the laxatives (unlike the cold turkey approach which landed me in the hospital last time due to edema/poor circulation) and my body not properly filtering fluid. I went in there today honest and polite about my symptoms and explained that due to the amount of time I've had my ED, I am now vomiting uncontrollably (I do not purge through vomiting), choking on vomit in my sleep, experiencing numbness around where I use the restroom, burning in chest/stomach, difficulty swallowing without straws. The first thing she asked me before even going in to my symptoms was, ""Do you take any psych meds for this?"" I told her I currently am not on psychiatric medication (due to adverse reactions). I also do not have depression (and have only experienced suicidal thoughts when on certain psych meds, hence why I've been taken off them). Than she starts asking me all about my weight. How much did you weigh before the anorexia? Were you always small? I started to get kind of worried because she hadn't even examined me yet and was just therapizing me. When I made the appointment I made it clear that I was coming there for issues and that I currently abuse laxatives. When I told her the amount of Dulcolax I take she gasped, giggled, and said ""You take THAT many?! I've never heard of that. I didn't even think that was possible."" Making me feel like a freaking guinea pig. She seemed to think I was taking them due to suicide versus them being a purging method from my ED and then started asking details of when I take them, how I got so many, how many at once. She made me feel like some bizarre anomaly and like laxative abuse is so unheard of in the ED community, which it's not. She asked why the doctors at the hospital didn't get me to a psych ward, it was just so uncomfortable and messed up. I felt so unheard and like I was gonna be taken away in a straightjacket. She didn't bother putting a stethoscope to me or examining me at all, she tapped my stomach and asked if it hurt. I told her it didn't. At one point she asked why I let it get this bad and I was like, ""I'm here, voluntarily asking for assistance and recognizing that it's a problem. But every doctor I've told (except for my cardiologist and a woman from ED center) has gasped at me and said they don't know what to do, just like you did. It was really refreshing last week to tell a clinician about the severity of my laxative abuse and not be laughed at like that."" Just so she knew how inappropriate it was. It felt like a big slap in the face. \n\nShe also ""educated"" me on how most people think people with anorexia ""just don't eat!"" And compared laxatives to smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. I asked her the safest way to wean off them so that I could get my life back together and she said, ""I could tell you, but either way you still have access and will probably just buy more or take them anyway.""\n\nI literally want to get off them. I guess I'll start weaning myself in increments of 10 or so? I currently take 80 and I'm not losing any weight despite being very underweight already. So yeah, I will not be going back to the GI who gasped at me and I guess I need to find someone else who can at least help me fix the stomach I have left.

2128,makeupyourworld,t5_s5o7i,"Hello guys. I posted maybe a week ago about how I've relapsed and it's been really bad. For a few weeks I've been a part of this ""ED Recovery Group"" on Facebook which really didn't feel recovery focused at all. It'd  been making me feel so much worse but I hadn't had the courage to leave. \n\nI'm very underweight, my BMI is in the 12 range, and I'm using laxatives pretty severely and have been trying to get help. I've been having physical symptoms, was hospitalized recently, and have had bad lab work. The members of this group were completely invalidating my ED. The group had rules like no number talk and recovery-focused yet I had multiple people send me bodycheck photos (in their bras), ask me about my intake, and tell me that my ED wasn't as bad as their's. I had one girl tell me that since I ate over 600 cals per day (she asked me over DM), that I probably wasn't really anorexic, one girl was promoting purging while pregnant, and another woman who had an assessment with an ED center (we both had assessments on Monday) told me she was ""surprised that they recommended the hospital's ICU for me because I eat so much,"" since I have photos of my cooking and me at restaurants on my personal Facebook. I do not have fear foods and more so fear any large portions of food (but am not scared of specific foods like pasta/fried food if that makes sense). They were essentially shaming me for eating those things. It was really evil and was encouraging me to keep starving and purging to feel validated. I left the group the other night and I feel so much better! I've also blocked the horrible people who dm'd me and made rude comments in my messages. \n\nOn another positive note, yesterday I finally got to see a cardiologist and he was so helpful and understanding of all my symptoms! My PCP has no experience with eating disorder's and has been watching me wither away and be sick, as if this is a joke even though I'm so scared. The cardiologist was so thorough, started me on blood pressure medication, and noticed that my feet and calves were blue. He was super smart and knew all of my symptoms just based off my vitals and an exam before even asking me. He asked me if I feel chest heaviness, have numbness in my limbs, etc. He ordered 3 tests and told me I need to take my new medication every day and to buy all caffeine-free diet soda if that's what I drink, and that it'll hopefully raise my blood pressure. I have a 24 hour long heart-monitor test, an ultrasound, and a circulation thing coming up and I'm so happy that someone is actually hearing my pain and wants to help me. He noticed the pounding in my chest that I've been complaining about and I'm hopeful that at least a doctor can start helping me so I don't die. I also have the GI this week which hopefully can help me safely get off laxatives and take a look at my ulcers and help me.

I am still severely underweight (Under 80 lbs in the morning, yes I weigh myself at night too unfortunately), but I feel DISGUSTING and I think my shameful binge behavior is to blame for this 😥. \n\nIt has been my routine consistently for 6 months to wake up every morning and have 8-10 ounces of fruit juice, and to do the same before bed because for awhile when I did not do this I felt very dizzy or would pass out in the morning or in the middle of the night be shaking and dizzy. I do this around 11:30 am on the average day, after making my bed, emptying the dishwasher, and weighing myself. However now I have found myself finding it hard to resist having a snack with this as well. For example this morning before I had my juice I had 2 Ritz Crackers, a small palmful of cheese, and a slice of cold cut salami. I also had a sugarfree sucking candy. I feel so guilty and ashamed for doing this and I've been doing it at least once a day and feel out of control. I find myself hiding while I do it and feeling ashamed of myself. After that I had my juice, took a shower and got ready, and at 1:30 had a toasted bagel with butter for ""lunch."" \n\nAlso throughout the day before dinner I've still been having cravings and grabbing things like a handful of baby spinach with balsamic vinegar, or japanese seaweed salad which is about 50 calories for a cup. I also exercise by walking 5 miles each day religiously. \n\nI feel really ashamed of myself for doing this. I feel like it's making me fat and gross and I can't tell if I am really binging or if I am genuinely just really hungry. Yesterday for example my mom bought some cookies and asked me if I wanted to try one. I took two bites and then threw the rest out because I felt like I binged and was awful. \n\nI usually eat a good sized dinner which will either consist of a bowl of pasta, or some chicken parmesan, or like some barbecue with coleslaw or corn. The other night I was tired and my mom made me orange chicken with broccoli and rice and told me it was healthy because it was homemade and she gave me a normal portion (it was a very small bowl) but it was fried and i felt so bad about myself after even though she said that's not a binge it's a normal dinner. Some days lately though it's been hard and for dinner i just want a salty snack like a bowl of popcorn or something. \n\nI just feel really out of control with these binges and need help because everyday i say i won't do it and then i do it again like i desperately want some seaweed salad right now but will feel like tomorrow i don't deserve a good hot dinner. I've even been scared to cook my favorite meals lately because im scared that ill feel too fat when i wake up the next day to even make it even though normally i like making dinner and eating it i usually do not binge at meal times at all. \n\nSo my question is, like what happened this morning with the crackers, or having some veggies during the day between meals a binge or am i just genuinely hungry",1610227413,TW - Mentions numbers.

They told me they sent over paperwork that required a signature stating I agreed to these terms but I never got the paperwork meaning they had no signature. At first they were saying they would work with me and an employee would take me out for 5 minutes everyday and then they stopped on day 4 and told me if I couldn’t get a dog walker that day that I would have to leave. Ultimately they said I was making the choice not to receive treatment and I was responsible. I don’t know what to do about this because now I’m forced to do recovery on my own.,1674852664,I was kicked out of ERC Plano because they wouldn’t let me take my service dog to the bathroom.,"[0.4496075244875776, 0.054656925703783374, 0.012744866566113192, 0.0025273385983350712, 0.001534486193875361, 0.017259073993849617, 0.03814294230818429, 0.3624538893122226, 0.0012230245106715485, 0.059849928325387325]"

Within a day of taking it, I was essentially non-functional due to drowsiness. I took the meds for 3 days, called to complain and was told to stop, and then went through two days of super intense withdrawal. The meds they put me on were so intense that after only 3 days of taking it, I went through two full days of withdrawal. I'm talking fever, shakes, vomiting, rapid heartbeat, the works. \n\nTheir answer? Prescribe me a different medication.

This deprivation gave me STRONG cravings for sugary snacks. \n\nWhat can I do next time? \nDo not deprive yourself at mealtimes. Especially when you worked out, your body had been under stress and you need to fuel it. Remember you are seeking health, not conforming to beauty standards. \nDon’t work at night after a long day. If you feel pressured to work, do something simple. Some reviewing. Don’t force yourself to work when you’re too tired to. This led to snacking while working, ultimately overeating. \n\nWhat am I going to tell myself? \nBe kind to your body and appreciate it. Trust in your higher self and guidance. This is not a failure.

I had a restrictive eating disorder for only about 6 or so months when I was eating about 500-1200kcal, only eating 'healthy' and I was over-exercising a lot. My hair started falling out, I lost my period, I was feeling cold all the time, was bruising everywhere, couldn't stop thinking about food ALL the time, lost a lot of weight really fast, and I could hardly do anything anymore - especially the things I enjoyed.

I still feel mental hunger, and it feels like it will never go away. And on my 'hungry' days I'm eating 4000-6000+ calories But I feel like it's not really valid for me to be listening to my mental hunger because I only restricted for a mere fraction of what other people have.

The longest period of recovery I managed was 2 years because i was buried in studies with the intention of becoming an eating disorder specialist - something I was well on track to accomplishing - but after being outed as a sex worker on campus I was refused an opportunity for grad school from the only ED specializing supervisor in my city, and I don't have options to pursue education elsewhere. When I had hope for a future in helping people recover, I had the motivation to maintain my recovery for the sake of using my struggles for the greater good ... but without that, I've just spiralled. After a literal decade of restricting and periods of being underweight and meeting all criteria for AN (and then maintaining the bare minimum for ""healthy"" BMI the rest of the time, minus the recovery stint), I've plunged face first into bulimia for the first time and once again, my BMI is tilting toward underweight. I'm not binging and purging per say - just purging whatever I deem ""unsafe"", which at this point is an ever growing list of foods, or even just a mild feeling of ""fullness"" that I don't want to deal with. \n\nI think the worst part of it all is that I just ... can't care. I don't see a way out. I'm approaching the age in which my partner and I are hoping to start a family, yet I'm actively relapsing and don't have the energy to pull myself up again, nor do I want to go back to therapy, nor do I want to go to treatment. I'm abusing anti anxiety medication and smoking like a chimney (also things I've never done before) and in all ways I feel like I'm just destroying my chances at having children ... but I can't stop. The guilt of approaching my 30s and still being as deeply entrenched in this bullshit as I was at 20 is crippling. I reach out to my support network, but I'm alone a lot which makes restricting during the day effortless, and my partner is seemingly oblivious to how easy it is to purge even with him in the house. \n\nBeyond that, with no real other options for a career moving forward at the moment, continuing on as an online sex worker (I model) means that thinner = richer. Harsh reality, but i've been in the industry a long time and it's just a simple fact, at least with the kind of content I produce. Why recover when I feel like my best option right now is to just make as much money as possible while I still can? At higher weights taking photos of myself is crippling; at lower weights it's just hours of body checking which I can deal with - even enjoy, in a sick way. \n\nMy loved ones keeping telling me that they're here for me regardless of where I'm at with my ED, and that they'll keep on supporting me until I'm ready to ""take care of myself"" ... but what does that even mean?

2288,peachyqueer,t5_s5o7i,"I *know* I am at an 'acceptable' or 'healthy' weight, ideal for my height. I have *known* this, objectively, since I was 13 or so. However, the ED pushes me to often believe that I am large, too much, unacceptable, chubby, etc. and I become convinced that everyone around me also believes that I am not thin enough, not good enough. I'm sure this is a common mindset among many of us on this sub, the crux of our collective disorders. The countless hours of therapy I have sat through have barely dented this mindset and at this point I have pretty much accepted it as a part of my day-to-day reality.\n\nAnother thing I struggle with that is not so common: I hate photos to the point of complete avoidance. In a selfie 'share everything' culture, I feel so far on the outside. I deleted social media because it depressed me to feel so overwhelmingly uncomfortable that I couldn't share my life the way other people do. I am envious of anyone who can post photos of themselves without thought, without going back to look at the picture a thousand times only to decide you hate it &amp; go on to delete its existence completely.\n\nThere have been many experiences I wish could have been recorded with a picture but I was too afraid to see myself. I have panic attacks occasionally &amp; sometimes just thinking about having my picture taken makes me so nervous I begin to not want to attend the event entirely. I was a bridesmaid a few months ago for my sister-in-law &amp; I obsessed over how big my arms were going to look in the sleeveless dress so much I thought I would explode with anxiety (luckily the party was informal enough that I was able to keep a cardigan on). I am generally 'okay' &amp; 'recovered' in every day life but when it comes to pictures - I crumble.\n\nYesterday my partner &amp; I received keys to our new home - a big deal (...but I've kind of been trying to numb myself out about the whole situation because FEELINGS). The real estate agent, happy for us but also wanting to market her work, asked to take a picture of us in front of our house. I like her a lot but immediately felt the pang of anxiety at the prospect of my photo being taken. I felt like I couldn't say no because it's such a 'normal' thing to do and I knew it would be a whole thing. She took the photo, texted it to us, and posted it on her real estate instagram account. \n\nJust her texting the photo to me made me have two reactions: 1) Oh, I guess I *am* a lot smaller than my partner (knowing they're five inches taller &amp; xxlbs heavier wasn't enough) &amp; 2) I guess this is an okay-acceptable photo. \n\nThen, this morning, seeing that she posted it on IG immediately makes me want to disappear. I stare at it through the eyes of strangers &amp; I think 1) my thighs are two big 2) my pants are ugly 3) that sweater makes me look like I have a belly 4) my face is ugly 5) my hair looks stupid, etc. I also sometimes have this kind of thing come up when family or friends take pictures &amp; post photos of me. Again, I don't have an IG account, but I suspected she was posting it &amp; felt compelled to seek it out. Maybe on some level I wanted to trigger myself??? I honestly don't know. I mostly just know that I feel like an unacceptable piece of shit.\n\nDoes anybody else truly struggle with this? I literally attempted to make myself &amp; my image disappear from the internet by deleting all of my social media accounts. I thought at first it was good for my mental health to avoid such triggers, but I admit to feeling left out of things. However, going back to social media seems incredibly overwhelming.

2303,petrasteele,t5_2tmc8,"Like Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon I’ve come around a certain age .Bulimia has been a part of my life since I was twelve. I’ve had my anorexic moments, my binging moments and I thought for the past few years I had left it behind. But of course not. It can’t be that easy. Let’s go back a few years. \n\n2018. I weigh about 200kg (400lbs). I have a really terrible health, some illnesses linked to the fact that I’ve nearly doubled my weight in the past five years. Some I struggle with since my teens, even my childhood. And in order to prevent me from kicking the bucket in the years to come I see a doctor who advises me to have a gastric bypass. I see a bunch of doctors, I’m cleared by my psychiatrist because I’m a good girl who has finally stopped all of her binging shenanigans so I have the surgery in 2019. It didn’t go well…\n\nWell the surgery was fine, no problem with it. I was the problem. Three months after the surgery (which was finally a gastric sleeve)… I. Just. Stopped. Eating. For a month. And did not took my medications. And barely even drank water for the last week. At that time I justified it by saying that I was tired, I had a gastritis that made me vomit nearly everything. But in fact I was so afraid to eat, to weigh myself, to not lose enough. \n\nI nearly died. Ended up in the hospital with an encephalopathy, between life and death. The cruel lack of nutriments I forced my brain into made it almost shut down, and I still live with its consequences (tremors, memory loss, damaged optic nerves to begin with). The recovery is long and hard. I left the hospital almost blind and in a wheelchair. I still have really bad eyes and can’t remember my own birthdate without thinking about it for a moment, but at least now I can walk with the help of a cane. \n\nDecember 2020. I regurgitate. A lot. I always have a good reason for it of course. My three year old sized stomach can’t handle food properly. I’m tired. Again. It’s my migraines that make me throw up. And it is just a coincidence if I take a big gulp of water before I go to the toilet. In the middle of my meal. A coincidence too, if I weigh myself ten times a day. \n\nAugust 2021. I’ve lost about 130kg (260lbs) since 2018. My skin sags all around my body. I’m always cold, even in the summer sun. I’m disgusted by myself. My appearance. My fiancé finds me hotter than ever. I try to not cry if by mistake I see myself in the mirror. I’m still losing weight, but it’s never enough. I binge and purge up to twenty plus times a day. Due to my baby stomach, my binges look like half a normal person’s meal. \n\nLast week I finally opened up to my psychiatrist. How I am. How I feel. How I spend my nights awake, in an endless cycle of binging and purging. How the slightest mention of my weight loss triggers me, even if it is a compliment. How I’m also triggered if no one notices it. \n\nMid September I’m going to something called an addiction center, since I live bulimia as an addiction. \n\nI’m 38 years old and for the first time I’m really taking care of my ED.

2306,pineappleonpizzayumm,t5_s5o7i,"So I gained a lot of weight in my late teens, then lost a lot of weight, more than what I weigh now and naturally got left with some loose skin. I have already had one operation to remove it on my neck, and was told by my plastic surgeon that surgery on my breasts and tummy would most likely be covered by insurance if I wanted to get those operated on as well, which I definitely do. \n\nThe problem is that it’s all I can think about a lot of the time, and the skin makes me feel ugly. Even when I was at a much higher weight, I had some excess skin and I remember thinking that I would rather be heavier without it than thin and have it. I guess I changed my mind at some point and sort of focused on numbers until I hit a weight where I had to recover or my life was going to become much more complicated, and since late last year I have been in recovery. My eating is okay right now, I’d say pretty normal. I have been maintaining for months. I could gain some more weight, I’m at the minimum “healthy weight” but the doctor I see doesn’t seem concerned and I eat whenever I’m hungry, sometimes even when I’m not and don’t deal with any other ED behaviors at the moment so I’m doing pretty well on that front.\n\nBut yeah, the loose skin… I think about it all the time and can’t wait until I can have more surgery to remove it. Like I said, the breast lift and tummy tuck (I assume these are the surgeries that I would have) are very likely to be covered by insurance, but I also have excess skin on my arms and thighs and was told that these surgeries I would have to pay out of pocket for if I were to get them.\n\nSometimes I don’t even want to leave the house because thinking about this makes me feel so down even though my clothes cover it, unless I were to wear sleeveless or crop tops which I never do. I’m not sure what to do about this. Obviously I shouldn’t base my happiness around this but it’s so hard not to think about these “flaws”. I have thought of joining a gym but I have other health issues that make working out difficult. Plus it would not remove the loose skin, only maybe make it a little less visible if I gained some muscle underneath it?

2307,pineappleonpizzayumm,t5_s5o7i,"I know it’s hard to say about another person’s body and all that, also I’m definitely not asking as a substitute to medical advice or anything. I kind of just wonder if anyone here has had that experience maybe?\n\nA little history to give you an idea. I had anorexia and was underweight ages 15 to 18, then it morphed into something similar to BED where I became terrified of undereating and started overeating as a reaction to that fear. Because of this, ended up tripling my lowest anorexia weight by the age of 22. After that I started slowly losing, at first sort of unintentionally, I didn’t pay that much attention to weight but was still obsessed with food and terrified of undereating but then on the other hand had started to really dislike my body and develop a desire to lose weight to the “normal” BMI range. I wasn’t consuming excessive amounts of food regularly anymore, the fear of undereating had kind of become smaller, although it was still there and occasionally resulted in these kind of overeating sessions. That became less and less though, and after a couple of years of slow unintentional weight loss due to going between undereating, overeating and sometimes just eating an average amount for periods of time, a little over a year ago I decided to start losing weight intentionally. At this point I was at “class 1 obese” (I hate that word but to give an idea) down from class 3 at my highest. Now, a bit over a year later at the age of 26 I’m right in the middle of the healthy BMI range (first time in this category as an adult) and have lost half my body weight from my highest... and I’m kinda miserable.\n\nI know I’m undereating for my body, but I’m scared to eat more for longer than maybe a week due to fear of gaining weight again. When I try increasing to what I believe is normal level by a combination of a little structure and intuitive eating (I have a dietitian and she approves of the amounts so I believe I’m neither under nor overeating when I’m doing this), after a week I feel very uncomfortable in my body. I have weighed myself at these moments and at most have gained a few pounds during these attempts at normal eating which I think could just be food/water weight, but I get scared of gaining and end up restricting again after about a week max of eating this way.\n\nDespite having the desire to keep losing weight to the minimum of healthy BMI (I have a feeling though that if I got there, I might want to keep going to the underweight range), I feel like I could accept recovery/normal eating if it meant I could maintain my current weight, with maybe even that occasional water weight fluctuation of a few pounds. Since I can’t be sure though that I would maintain eating this way, I keep going back to restriction to lose more weight. I have this thought process that is like “if I’m going to count calories, I’ll do it to the level where I’ll lose instead of eating at my maintenance”. If I have to obsess over numbers, I’d rather lose weight in the process.\n\nI hope I’m making sense. Basically, this is my very long-winded way of asking if it’s possible to not gain weight going back to normal eating? I have read some intuitive eating stories where people have done that, or even lost weight (though these people might have been at a higher weight). Then again, there are stories of the opposite, so I don’t know. \n\nI feel like because my body has been at such a high weight before, it’s more likely to gain than a person’s that has never been there. I don’t know this to be a fact but I keep hearing people talk about “diets don’t work long-term” and “95% of people gain the weight back or more after restricting” and it scares me.\n\nSorry about writing a novel.

I have a therapist, an ED specialist no less, but I haven’t found her helpful with eating much at all, I think she is pretty good with OCD stuff though.

I admitted to being sick and said I ate something that didn’t agree w me. The toilet was barely dirty.

Just live your life. When she sees that you’re unaffected she will stop.”\nEasier said than done. \nShe also said she thinks my roommate is jealous of me since she preaches about her own body image and weight and she said “anyone that discusses their own weight and image in front of someone w an ED has issues of their own and she’s definitely jealous of you.” \nThere is nothing to be jealous of.

It began with anorexia the bulimia then binge eating but I’ve been attempting to be recovery focused for 3/4 years now, but still struggle with stealing food.\nI’ve been stealing food from whoever I live with, wether that be flatmates or family. It began as a binging thing but I don’t binge anymore so It’s pretty much a compulsion at this point. I’m not strapped for cash and I CAN afford to buy myself food so it’s not a money thing. I often find myself stressed out and wasting loads of money trying to replace my flatmates food in a rush before they notice. \n\nI also steal food from supermarkets, but I do this less out of compulsion and more out of greed I think. It’s usually protein bars and expensive things I don’t want to spend money on. When I do a weekly food shop I always feel like I have to shoplift the expensive things because I can’t justify spending more than £X amount on groceries for the week for myself, even though I’m not tight for money. I feel like I can’t justify spending money on food as it makes me feel “greedy” (??) but on the other hand I feel like I’m being greedy and selfish by stealing the food. I’ve been caught once stealing protein powder at whole foods and I don’t want to risk being caught again. \n\nStealing from my flatmates has caused them to get very suspicious and hostile at each other (I don’t think they suspect it’s me) but I can’t help but feel that they will find out eventually if I don’t manage my habit and stop now. \n\nDoes anyone relate/ have any advice? \nI brought this up to my therapist in my last session but she didn’t really have any good advice for me. \nHoping I’m not the only one dealing with this.",1672781829,Stealing and shoplifting food,"[0.09106017221970492, 0.3031802997702714, 0.0656307881560887, 0.0016240395807926486, 0.1094858598210152, 0.023855172603901065, 0.35639201956409183, 0.009526850302976588, 0.0071682440273403035, 0.03207655395381745]"

This thing has YET AGAIN taken over my life.\n\nMy family and friends are always giving advice--my mom and sister have both recovered from BED and other forms of eating disorders, but they have never been fat. Not even a little bit. I feel like they don't understand my PERSONAL struggle.\n\nI still have weight to lose. I'm healthy, and I look ""normal,"" but I want to be thin. I have never been thin without drugs. I have over 3 years sober now, and I'm thinking I may never be thin, that it's just not who I am or how I'm built, but I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS. I want to be thin.

I made sure I hide all my pain well because I know people around me don’t really get mental illness. But with restricting, I can’t really hide how my body shape changed drastically in only four or five months.\n\nI have been on family vacation for the past week, and I received many probing questions or comments about my eating behavior and my weight, though no one knows about my mental health conditions. I stayed composed dealing with those, until one particular comment. We got to a new hotel and my mom found out the room has a scale. She was curious about my weight so she pushed me to weigh myself. Even with me trying to intake more during family meals, the nature of busy vacation causes a significant drop in weight. My mom got very excited and shared the news with her husband. Her ruthless/cold/cruel/full of sh*t (excuse my language) husband replied with: “She probably throws up whenever she goes to the toilet and becoming an anorexic.”\n\nI just can’t control myself after that. I went into a full breakdown crisis mode. It took me lots of effort to reach out for help, trying to do damage control before potentially developing behaviors other than pure restriction. I have also been battling with suicidal ideation: trying to stay alive has been a really hard task. And ironically, I was trying to stay alive because I don’t want my family to be impacted for rest of their lives. On top of dealing with these chaos alone, being randomly accused and targeted is not helping. I just feel so helpless. I hate when people are so ignorant and mean. I never shared my illness with my family because I don’t want them to worry, and I know they won’t understand. The only thing I have hoped is that they don’t make things worse. I never even asked any support or comfort from them. But I guess with all the hiding I still cannot prevent myself from being hurt by the supposedly closest people to me.

Though I was made fun of in school, though my family, relatives, friends, and some doctors I had have all told me throughout the years I need to eat healthy and exercise more to achieve a healthy BMI, I always brushed them off and never really let my behavior be affected by those comments.

I almost hit the obese category in summer and it was like a wake up call for me, so I started to do more home cooking, cutting back on snacking, and paying attention on my hunger cues.

2468,scarlettevergreen,t5_o3plh,"Hey everyone, I could use some wisdom on this. I am nearly a year into recovery. I was severely underweight, hospitalized and relapsed, then was hospitalized again 3 months later. I had some pretty traumatic inpatient experiences and experiences with treatment providers, and consequently left their care to pursue recovery independently. \n\nNow that I do not physically appear 'sick,' I am finding it hard to justify eating sometimes when I feel like I could just 'go without' or i'm not hungry. But I know in recovery they recommend 3 meals and 3 snacks. But what about when you are weight-restored, when you DO have your cues back? I feel sorta bad for continuing to eat 3 meals and 3 snacks without intentionally changing the size or frequency, or eating a proper lunch instead of a small snack or granola bar like I used to, when I am not in dire need of gaining weight. Before I relapsed hard, I was not stringent about eating at regular intervals, so now I think ""oh I can just skip things if i'm not hungry or hungry enough."" But then again, before I relapsed I was flirting with it all the time. I don't know what to do from here. I don't want to eat when I don't 'need' to if this recommendation is only for when weight-restoring. Especially when so many people around me emphasize how many meals they skip, I feel silly and 'excessive' for sticking to a structure.

2470,scarlettevergreen,t5_o3plh,"Hello,\n\nI am reaching out because I am experiencing something seriously annoying, that is not just affecting my physical health, but also my emotional wellbeing. It is making me feel like I am persistently 'overeating,' although I am pretty confident the amount I am eating is NOT obscene. I seriously would appreciate all opinions.\n\nI was released from hospital for Anorexia Nervosa a little over a month ago. Whilst in hospital and at home, my hunger cues were restored, I did not experience symptoms of delayed gastric emptying, and I woke up hungry. I also do not experience constipation either and drink adequate quantities of water. I have not changed anything in my diet recently and I eat healthily. Honestly, I do not think the two are at all related, considering that this has just recently begun to occur.\n\nFor about three weeks now, however, when I wake up my stomach feels bloated/full. It's not just that I am 'not hungry,' but rather that food is like physically still in my stomach, although I eat dinner at 6 PM and not in huge quantities. I feel a 'fluttery' sensation in my abdomen as well. It is not just that food 'doesn't sound appealing,' or I am physically hungry but psychologically denying it...believe me, I wish that were the case. The thing is, I feel genuinely satiated. My stomach hardly ever feels 'empty.' I have gotten so frustrated with this that one day I just even didn't eat all day until dinner because I felt no urge to eat and my stomach felt full, and even then, I experienced no signs of low blood sugar (dizziness, hanger, etc), hunger pangs, and when dinner rolled around I had to physically force myself to eat.\n\n**Lately, I have found myself stuck in a cycle of forcing myself to eat food I am not physically nor mentally hungry for because I can't just 'not eat' all day, and this only exacerbates the problem because I wake up the next morning feeling stuffed. The only time this (waking up super full/gassy/bloated) doesn't happen, is if I wait to eat until I am genuinely hungry...and to feel genuinely HUNGRY, it's like I would need to not eat for like over a full day to feel a rumbling/emptiness in my stomach again.**\n\n**I am annoyed because I ACTUALLY want to enjoy food again, but when I start eating I am not even hungry to begin with....then I wake up feeling gross...cycle repeats.**\n\nI want to give a few examples of this:\n\nFor example, yesterday I ran at the gym (4 miles). I had overnight oats at home, which didn't even sound appealing but I ate a little bit of them at like 8 AM. I was full for the rest of the entire day, and when dinner rolled around, I went out with my mom and got salmon &amp; veggies, a meal that is normally my favorite but I didn't even notice the flavors because my stomach was like legitimately NOT empty?\n\nA few days ago, I was genuinely hungry for dinner (for once). I had salmon/sweet potatoes/rice. My mom prepared it and it was a bigger portion than I would have given myself, but I ate it, and whilst I felt pretty full after I skipped my night snack. In the morning though? Still obscenely full. I ate my first meal at 1 PM, which was a Starbucks PB/J bento box, and when dinner rolled around at 7 PM, again I was not hungry in the slightest and forced myself to eat a veggie burger that didn't even sound appealing.\n\nAgain, it gets worse if I DO eat when my stomach is full...so I don't know if I should keep trying to eat regularly or just wait for it to feel empty again? Do you think this is a sign I am in a massive caloric surplus or eating too much?",1634042929,Always Full?,"[0.0008264789501376225, 0.4031823407195709, 0.0008748776138216025, 0.0038755850169682094, 0.056087391774914945, 0.033173526553395574, 0.21576811697643225, 0.001522136869180643, 0.07761665509904951, 0.20707289042652877]"

2474,sew_over_it,t5_s5o7i,"I’m visiting my parents atm and the day before yesterday they asked me to sort through some old boxes of my stuff to try to throw stuff out, donate stuff, and decide what to keep. Well I found diaries and planners from when I was a teenager (EDNOS/OSFED with a strong tendency towards purging).\n\nThere were plans of meals and snacks with calories alongside that I remember trying to follow, totalling about 300-500 cals a day - I don’t even restrict that low now, in the midst of anorexia. no wonder I was in a binge/restrict cycle. There were lamentations on not being attractive enough and how once I lost weight I’d finally be noticed by boys (I already knew I was bi so it’s fascinating to me that I related my appearance to how much boys would like me, not any other gender). \n\nWhat made me seriously sad was seeing hard proof of what I weighed and what I wanted to weigh - I couldn’t really remember that, only a vague idea. It’s sad that I was a totally normal, healthy weight, but thought of myself as fat - something I don’t experience now, I certainly don’t think I’m fat and this time around when I was that same weight I *also* didn’t think I was fat. I haven’t thought I was fat since I was objectively overweight and even then I don’t see being fat as a bad thing. My goal weight back then (that I never got down to) was more than what I weigh now as well, it’s actually become my upper limit of what I consider ‘acceptable’. \n\nIt’s wild how different the ‘cause’ of my disorder was back then vs now. Back then it was about not being acceptable socially, thinking I’d be better liked if I was better looking, especially by boys (because that I guess was the social capital at my school in my eyes). My dysmorphia was obviously very strong and I remember now how lonely I was and how I thought I’d have more people if only I was prettier and skinnier. This time it’s fully about control - about getting control back after years of BED making me feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore, and then about getting to a specific number because *symmetry* - my dysmorphia has actually gotten better as I’ve gotten thinner this time.\n\nSomething I’d blocked out was that I was going through periods where I’d purge every day/multiple times a day - I don’t even remember this. I remembered periods of planning b/p sessions and thinking that was the worst of it but apparently not. Reading that I was wondering how I even got away with this - I don’t purge often now but when I have it’s been obvious on my face (thankfully I live alone). And yet no one ever suspected me back then. Well yesterday I felt like I ate too much lunch and decided to purge some of it and somehow, like fucking dark magic, I did it without fucking my face up - no puffy bloodshot tear-filled eyes, no blood vessels burst, my cheeks didn’t even swell up - all that happened was my nose got a bit runny and my face blushed, which went away when I washed it. I know now how I got away with purging when I knew people would see me after - I didn’t even write that in my diary, it just came back to me how when I needed to I could purge without looking like I had. \n\nI’m so sad for teenage me but a fucked up part of my brain can’t help but feel *proud* of myself for finally ‘succeeding’ at my ED when younger me couldn’t do it, couldn’t lose weight without immediately regaining it. It’s seriously messing with the healthy part of my brain that that teenage part of me would be so overjoyed that I’m this size now, that I’m so good at restricting when that was always my goal back then - to be good at starving myself. \n\nJust a mindfuck I guess - in some ways I’m sicker now, but in some ways I was sicker back then.",1673304594,old diaries,"[0.0008239334496053576, 0.047748167805119805, 0.007032050839166141, 0.16402021102591122, 0.00047583620083536477, 0.13778910672408445, 0.24898283828752424, 0.1431944079711601, 0.0034591874454327973, 0.24647426025116054]"

I said no, actually the opposite I’ve been barely going to the gym because my normal gym is closed for renovation and walking to and from the other gym adds half an hour to the whole process of going which has been really annoying, why did she ask? She said ‘you’re just looking very toned’. \n\nI work in fashion retail, and after this interaction I went to try on a dress I wanted to get for uniform - the smallest we had in stock was an S, I usually wear an XS in this brand but occasionally an S if a style runs small, but my boss was like ‘try on the S I think it will fit’. Anyway it didn’t, it was too loose, and then I made the mistake of asking ‘I’m not getting too thin, am I?’ Being underweight has never been my goal (I used to be obese), I don’t want to be super super thin, my goal weight would put my BMI at 20.6. She obviously knows I’ve been losing weight rapidly (you can’t lose so much weight in the time I’ve worked there and it not be noticed) and we’ve actually discussed weight and body issues before, but I’ve never told her I have an ED beyond admitting I might be a little obsessive with my diet, even though we’ve discussed my other MH issues. Anyway I said ‘my mum thinks I’ll be too thin if I lose want I want to lose, even though it’s only another kilo or two’ and she said basically said she thinks I’m getting too obsessive and focused on a number (bingo, that’s true, I don’t think I’m fat at all I’m obsessed with getting to half my starting weight for the *symmetry* ) and she’ll be concerned about me if she sees me next week and I’ve lost even more weight. \n\nOur work Christmas part was the next day and I know that I was looking quite small in my outfit, and I could tell she kept looking at me and I’m sure she was noticing that my upper body is getting kind of bony (she mentioned during our conversation that if I lose more it’ll come from places I don’t want it to and that my upper body already looks very thin, which I agreed with because, well, it does), and that the rest of me looks pretty small too - my uniforms at work are all kind of loose or draped, but I was wearing a slip dress that night so my body was definitely more visible.\n\nI’m also sure she was observing what I was eating - I ate a normal amount for a nice dinner out (because I barely ate all day in preparation), I think I actually ate a little more than her, so maybe that placated her but I’m sure I could see her watching what I was eating every now and then. No surprises, I wanted to keep eating beyond what I considered ‘enough’ because the food was so good so I decided to do so but purge when I got home - once I decided that I used *that* strategy, and I’m wondering if she also noticed that as well and knew what it meant.

(I’m 21 now) \n2 years ago, I started having ED behavior and thoughts very strongly again, and currently I’m struggling with it - some days are better than others and I like to think that I’m improving, but other days I’m not so sure about that. \nAnyway, it quite clear by the way I eat and how I eat that my eating isn’t exactly “normal” - my close friends have noticed and picked up on this well. \nOne of my close friends particularly noticed this, and would get particularly upset when I wouldn’t eat with her or eat what she was eating.....\nI thought it was mainly concern about my health and well-being, but now I fear it may also stem from jealousy and insecurities with her own body image. \n\nRecently this friend started the gym, and she started telling me about her new “healthy” lifestyle. I encouraged her and told her that it’s good she’s making positive lifestyle changes. \nAnyway, long story short, this friend quickly ended up becoming obsessive about the gym and about the way she ate as well.... she recently began counting calories in everything, and started refusing treats and such foods. \n\nI know all this because this friend has made it a point to tell me. From what I gather, (and from what she’s told me), she knows I’ve gone through/am going through an eating disorder and she views me as an older sister figure who will be able to guide her and help her through this disorder......\nShe recognizes that her behavior is disordered and not normal. \n\nI truly and sincerely love this friend and am touched she views me this way and trusts me. But, I am also quite frankly jealous, and annoyed. \n\nThe fact that my friend has started this ED journey and is losing weight is making me go insane with anger; it really has ignited my competitive streak, and I feel a strong urge to win this “competition” of who will be the skinniest. \n\nI know that her talking about her ED is very triggering for someone who is dealing with an ED herself. I know deep down, I should probably tell her that I’m dealing with an ED myself and am probably not the best person to help her manage it. \nBut her telling me about her disordered eating has triggered a perverse response in me. I feel the need to keep tabs on what she’s eating and how she’s eating so I can make sure I eat less and exercise more than her. \n\nIt’s such a fucked up situation because I truly love my friend. It may not seem like it (according to everything I’ve written so far), but I sincerely care about her. \nMy irritation and competitiveness is making me focus on the fact that I feel threatened by her potentially becoming thinner than me, but I’m also scared for her mental health and her going down a dark and painful road......\n\nAnother thing that’s very frustrating about this situation is that I’ve urged this friend (on multiple occasions) to speak to a therapist about her eating.\nHowever, she is VERY hesitant to do so and seems content on simply confiding in me. She is VERY open with me about her lack of eating and her excessive exercise. \n\nI don’t want to let her down because I realize that she views me as an empathetic figure of trust, but it is very tough for me to handle her issues in a balanced manner. \nOn one hand I feel extremely irritated that my weight loss is being “challenged” and threatened, and another hand I’m genuinely scared for someone I love. \nI’m not sure what I should do or how I can handle this.

Like, low restricting. Two days ago everything went to shit. \n\nIt might have been a panic attack, I was suicidal and making up plans in my head.  I was very light headed, nauseous, couldn’t focus on anything, cold sweats, shaking, and my heart rate was between 130-150 lying down. I thought that was probably it, I was finally having problems because of the eating disorder. I was planning on skipping dinner. I was home alone. When my family came back, I told them that I thought I wasn’t eating enough and that it had finally caught up to me. So they made me eat a bunch of things with sugar and stuff, mostly fruits, things that are quick to digest in case it was low blood sugar. They gave me anti anxiety meds and I managed to sleep a few hours later when my heart calmed down a bit. The whole thing lasted 6 hours. \n\nIt’s been two days and I don’t feel recovered. I still feel incredibly weak. I tried to eat more yesterday but couldn’t really. Same symptoms, just less intense. My heart rate is still somewhat high but it won’t go down (90-100bmp). I wanted to nap but I was dragged to the mall, I thought I would faint. I ordered a Frappuccino grande for some easy calories and sugar, which I never would have done, ever. Same with a foot long sandwich. I ate half and I’m keeping the rest for later. I noticed nicotine makes EVERY symptom worse, so my resolution is to quit that. \n\nI’m stuck away from home with no doctor so I can’t have reinsurance. I don’t see my psychiatrist until the 16th.

I don’t have access to a scale on vacation, and I thought “I’ll see what I do once I can weigh myself” despite the huge scare I had. I’m barely underweight, I thought I wouldn’t get a scare like that at my weight. I’ve only had an ED for 9 months, I thought it would take years.

My parents have always had an idea of who I'm supposed to be and get frustrated with me when I try to just live my own life the way I want to be. My dad is especially emotionally ignorant and unavailable. He really is just an awful communicator. He has always made me feel like shit about my weight. As early as like 6 years old he was telling me I couldn't eat dessert like my brothers cause my ""metabolism is too slow"". Last March I went into recovery and finished in October. He and my mom did family therapy. He is still completely oblivious and my mom claims she understands but she only gets maybe 50% of it.\n\nSo tonight after dinner he suddenly calls a family meeting and starts talking about how video games are bad for your health blah blah blah and basically insinuating that me and my brothers are playing too many video games and it's making us fat and lazy. Okay he didn't say those exact words but anytime someone tries to imply that I'm being lazy or ""sitting down too much"" it triggers the ever loving fuck out of me. I associate being lazy with gaining weight/being fat and as an overweight person with Atypical Anorexia it just hurts so fucking much. It hurts more when people are vague and try to beat around the bush.\n\nAnd listen, I do play a lot of video games, but I also work my ass off.

They had appeared over night and I’ve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life. \n\nI relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself. \n\nAnd then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me. \n\nI was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work. \n\nEver since then, things have been turning around. I’ve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it’s much easier to dismiss.

2626,throw-away-436205836,t5_2zzq8,"(I posted this in r/mentalhealth the other day but I wanted to post it here too to see if you guys had anything different to say.)\n\nI'm not sure if I have an eating disorder or not. I'm scared to talk to my doctor or psychiatrist or therapist about it. I keep telling myself that it's not ""bad enough"" to be a ""real"" eating disorder. But then again, I've heard that it's common for people with eating disorders to think that, and that that's just the ""ED voice"" talking. But how do I tell the difference?\n\nAlso sometimes I think that maybe I'm just doing it for attention, and therefore it couldn't be a real ED, because sometimes when people say something to me like ""you don't eat enough/ you need to eat more"" or ""you're too skinny"" or ""you're so bony, you need to gain some weight,"" it feels really validating. If I had a REAL eating disorder, I wouldn't like it when people noticed and said things like that, would I? I've heard/read that people with EDs are often very secretive about their behavior and don't want anyone to notice. But I almost WANT people to notice. It makes me feel like they care about me, and then if fuels me to keep doing it so that they continue to care and don't abandon me. (Probably sounds really pathetic, doesn't it...) Sometimes I don't want people to notice certain things though. For example, I never let others see me enter my calories into the calorie-counting app on my phone, and I make sure I'm in a private place where no one will see/hear me when I make myself throw up (but I've only done that 3 or 4 times). Also, I like some people to notice/say certain things, but not others. For example, I like it when my boyfriend tells me I need to eat more, but I feel super uncomfortable when my mom says the exact same thing.\n\nI feel like if I do have an ED, it's very inconsistent and doen't fit into certain parts of the ED descriptions and symptom checklists I've read. For example, I do still eat high-calorie foods like ice cream and chocolate sometimes. I'm a bit underweight, but not severely underweight -- my bmi is about 17.7 I think. I don't weigh myself every single day. I do exercise a lot, and I'm pretty anal about making sure I go for a run every day, but I allow myself a day off each week. (If I take more than 2 days off in 1 week, I feel ""fat"" and guilty for it.) I'm not losing weight super rapidly. I've been eating at a calorie deficit most days, but I don't restrict like crazy to like 500 calories per day or something. I have made myself throw up before, but not often. Maybe like 3 times in the past month? And before that I hadn't done it in over a year.\n\nI don't know what to do, and I'm too scared to talk to anyone irl about it yet, so that's why I'm ranting to internet strangers. Honestly, what scares me even more than the possibility of being diagnosed with an ED, is the possibility of NOT being diagnosed with an ED. That probably sounds really weird but what I mean by that is that I'm scared of being told that feeling this way and doing these things is just normal, and life just sucks this bad. (I remember feeling the same way before I was diagnosed with depression.) Also I'm scared that if i DO get diagnosed with an ED, that they'll stop me from losing weight and force me to gain weight. Tbh, part of me really wants to be able to eat more and not constantly have to worry about calories and feel guilty for it, and to be reassured by a medical professional that it's okay and healthy, but the other part of me is completely freaked out at the idea of gaining weight and losing all the ""progress"" I've made. And that part of me is also afraid that once I eat more/gain weight I'll lose control and be unable to stop somehow, and then I'll get fat.\n\nTL;DR: I think I might have an eating disorder, but I'm not sure. I keep wavering back and forth about whether it's bad enough to be a ""real"" eating disorder, or if I'm just faking it or making it up or something.

There are probably spelling mistakes, I didn’t proof read if. I don’t want to read it. It’s 6 AM, I haven’t been to sleep and I just needed this out of my head asap.)  \n\nYou can skip this if you want. I just really want to explain how this happened but I have no interest in telling people I know irl about it because I’m afraid of giving tips or tempting someone to fall down this hole. I’m going to keep the specifics to myself because I still don’t want to offer tips to anyone. But I’m assuming a lot of people in this subreddit have gone through similar experiences so it’s okay for me to speak freely. \n\n\nBasically what happened was I \n (F17 at the time) moved in my with sister for a bit. My sister and her roommate weren’t on the best terms in regard to finances. So my sister wouldn’t buy groceries for the house because the roommate would benefit from it without paying for anything herself. So instead we ate meal to meal. My sister would bring home fast food and food from the restaurant she worked at regular. On top of food she would always made sure I had one sweet candy, one chocolate type candy, a bag of ships and soda. Everyday. \n\nAs you can imagine I gained so much weight. I didn’t notice how much I gained until a few months later I moved back in with my mom. I started getting heart burn and I definitely had a stomach ulcer because all the chips my sister bought were typically hot ones. So everyday I was eating hot chips. \n\nI decided for the sake of my health and how I was feeling, I wanted to change my diet. I started eating healthier. Just making conscious efforts to be more nutritious nothing crazy. I noticed within a month I dropped around 15 pounds. I wasn’t restricting, working out or anything. Just changed the way I ate. So then I decided that I loved the way weight loss looked on me and wanted to actually give it a try. I’ve had issues with my body my entire life, so for once I was doing something about it and I felt great. \n\n\nI started watching YouTube videos and learning about weight loss. I was very adamant on not wanting to calorie count. I didn’t want eating to become something I felt guilty of. (Foreshadowing. And man, If only I knew what I know now.) so I didn’t calorie count. I started working out and running a mile on the treadmill every day. I started cutting out red meat, gluten and dairy. \n\nAnother foreshadowing moment is because I was watching weight loss videos on YouTube I started being suggested peoples restricting diaries they uploaded. I remember looking at these videos disgusted and unsettled that YouTube would allow such sad and dark content.\n\nEventually I started calorie counting 1300 daily. I did this because most of the YouTube videos were saying to lose weight I HAD to be in a calorie deficit. So I told myself I was allowed to calorie count but not do it so seriously. If I over eat slightly oh well- it was just a target area to reach. But as you could imagine that didn’t stop the slight guilt I felt whenever I did eat past my 1300 calories. \n\nI was so excited at first for working out but eventually that changed. I started getting anxiety whenever I would lay down to go to sleep because I knew the first thing I did in the morning was work out. I HATED working out. I hated it so much. I was motivated for a solid week before it became a chore. I was getting panic attacks every night over it. \n\nWhat ended up happened around this time was my mom was in between grocery shopping. I was on a gluten free, dairy free, red meat free diet. So I ate very specific things. At the time I had no food at all that I could eat besides grapes, black beans and eggs. So I started accidentally restricting. I was eating 700 calories a day because i didn’t have food. I was obviously keeping track. I didn’t realize I was actually starving myself until I noticed I was losing weight. And I LOVED the way I looked. Well, less about the way u looked- I loved the weight loss progress I was making at such a quick rate. I had spent the last 6 months of my life having panic attacks over working out and THIS was how I started seeing the results I desperately wanted. \n\nSo I told myself I’d stop restricting once I got to the weight loss goal. One that I’ve never met and probably never will. I don’t know if a perfect version of myself even exists anymore. I eventually started finding comfort and enabling in those YouTube videos I mentioned before. The SAME videos I was disgusted by became my best friend. It made me not feel alone and it intrigued me to see how people struggled like me and how they dealt with it. \n\nMy sister who bullied me my entire life about my weight saw me for the first time in months around when I first developed my ED. She told me she was *proud* of my weight loss. I wanted to cry because she didn’t get it. She doesn’t get it. She doesn’t get that to look and maintain the way I do now I have to starve myself.  As much as I hated this comment she made it only enabled me more. It’s something I still think back to and “motivates” me.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m going to add a list I made a while back because I’ve always wanted to share it but I obviously don’t want to publicly advertise I have an ED and the only place I can share it is here.

I was on a really strong self love journey that is completely gone now. \n\n- I was really into modeling/ photography. I haven’t picked my camera up in months. My Instagram account, which used to be my joy, has been neglected for nearly a year now. \n\n- I look in the mirror and only see what’s wrong. \n\n- “when I lose a bit more weight I will be able to....” mind set. \n\n- I can’t see food without seeing them as numbers. \n\n- laxatives are very regular for me. \n\n- none of my clothes fit me the same any more. Whenever I order clothes online I keep trying to order my old sizes, I guess I’m in denial about the weight I’ve loss. Now I have a bunch of new cloths that don’t fit from different times I’ve tried to buy new clothes. \n\n- I don’t eat red meat, gluten, carbs or dairy rarely ever. \n\n- heart burn. all. the. time. \n\n- if I eat junk food, even if it’s within my daily calorie count, I feel guilty. \n\n- I’ve had clear skin practically my entire life, now I regularly get acne. \n\n- bruises come out of no where. \n\n- scary nightmares whenever I fall asleep\n\n- Too tired to function but can never sleep.

This infuriates me yet I can’t help but to feel like it’s only triggered me to want to keep going. \n\nI don’t have fast metabolisms. I tried working out and eating health (which is how I accidentally developed my eating disorder) but I hate it. I hate working out so much I was having panic attacks before bed thinking about how I’m the morning I was going to have to work out. For the rest of my life I’m going to be stuck where I can either be fat and miserable, working out and miserable or restricting and miserable. There is no middle ground for me. It feels like there never will be. \n\nPlus the dynamic with my mother is weird. She constantly comments on how she thinks I’m skinny but will ridicule me whenever I eat. ie; halo top ice cream is low cals. If I eat the entire pint she will make comments about how crazy it is that I ate a whole thing. (But she does the same for normal Ben and Jerry’s ice cream?) It feels like my mom is in a one sided competition with me. The only way she feels she can win is tearing me down. This only triggers me even more and makes me never want to eat around her despite the fact I hardly do anyways. \n\nI feel so useless. I’ve gained weight recently and I’ve started restricting again. I was finally back on routine when today my mom offered to make a salad. I agreed figuring it was the normal salad we eat. But it wasn’t, this salad was over 600 calories. I didn’t want to eat it when I saw it but my mom was telling me I had to. So I figured I just wouldn’t eat for the rest of the day. But this stupid salad triggered a major binge for me. Now I’m self loathing right now wishing I wasn’t so broken. Mentally and physically. \n\nThe last thing I’m gonna vent about is kind of dumb. I can’t/ don’t expect people to censor themselves for the sake of me and my issues. But does anyone else with an ED use tik tok and see trends like “fast metabolism checkkkk!” And hate themselves. It really sucks because content that is quirky and fun for people with fast metabolism makes me hate myself. I wish I was like that. I wish I could eat whatever and not have a care in the world. Instead I’m counting every calories I consume, fasting for as long as possible and hating myself if I eat over 1000 calories. \n\nI’m gonna stop venting now. If anyone actually read this I’m sorry.

Idk if I’m actually anorexic or just bulimic or just a mix of both I know EDNOS is a thing but im not sure where I fall. i have been severely restricting( I won’t include the cal amount but I do track them) with an occasional binge/purge episode like once or twice a week for about two years and have lost a significant amount of weight, but right now I’m just on the border of being underweight and regular weight, maybe like a couple pounds underweight first thing in the morning. Usually by the end of the day I’m like right at the cusp of a healthy weight. I do weigh myself every morning and every night and several times in the day. I don’t allow myself any “junk food” and eat the same very little amount of calories every single day and workout every day. If I don’t workout I don’t eat anything until dinner that day and I make sure my parents don’t cook with oils or add anything too extra to the food or else I will freak out and probably purge it. I haven’t not purged food from a restaurant in years unless it’s from one of 3 safe restaurants where I get a low cal meal and if it’s not the way I asked or they mess it up I’ll take it apart. When I have a binge and purge episode it’s always after severe restriction for several days, I haven’t gone a week without doing it for a while because I’ll try and recover and push myself to eat a scary food and then I eat all the food and purge and it’s a super hard cycle to break. It’s just super rigid and weird and a lot of purging food cause it scares me. Because I’m not extremely thin I feel like I’ve made the whole thing up. I went to the doctor to get help for the eating disorder and she said I don’t have any physical red flags, my weights been the same after the huge drop in weight a few years ago, and I had to ask to see a dietician to help me with what I should be eating. She didn’t recommend me anything besides blood work and I have to call the dietitian on my own because she said I should get a call from them later in that day and I never did, so now idek if I want to… It feels invalidating. My parents said “if you tell the doctor you have a cut but you don’t have a gash or any sign of a cut anywhere how are they supposed to help” which makes me want to get thinner and lose more so someone can just believe me. I feel like it’s all in my head and I just made it up if nobody wants to help me. I went to the doctor with hopes of recovery but now I don’t want to because I don’t even feel like there’s anything to recover from.

2721,upandawaywethrowin,t5_rbmui,"I'm assuming there will be a few food bloggers or influencers on here. Did you start doing that before ED or after/during? How did it influence your relationship with food and body?\n\nI used to be one. At first I thought that was during recovered area when really it was just my binge era. It definitely helped me learn to get excited over food again and appreciate it. But it also had obsessive tendencies and eventually made me over focus on food. The friends I made during that time are usually picked by their passion for food. Foodies. And now that I'm ✨back on my bs, I barely have any connecting interests with them. I don't want to discuss junkfood. I don't want to check out new restaurants with them. I don't want to share a friendship that's a cycle of gifting and receiving little special snacks. I don't want to meet up ti share a binge on ""healthy carbs"". And I realised that, without all that, these friendships are so shallow. Some of these people share the most opposite opinions on core values of mine. Some of them have aggressive hate on thin women and label it as ""body positivity"". Some of them are just super boring to me. And I am probably to them. I have so many interests and passions that aren't food or ED related that I can't share with the friends I made during that time. When I relapsed, all the lockdowns hit, and so it got very isolating for a while. Not able to organically make new friends. I stopped posting on my social media because I didn't feel the connection to that issue anymore. Eventhough it became my job for years so I can't just throw it away like that. I tried getting back to it a few times. But it's so exhausting. It's literally the opposite of what I'm now, yet none of these states were ""normal"" or ""healthy"". But covering up my binge era as being a ""foodie"" is so much more marketable than being a health conscious ortho/AN person. So much more socially acceptable. Really, nobody ever doubted my health and mental state during that time.\n\nI think my binge era initiated me into becoming a food influencer, while my other ED eventually turned me away from it. And I feel like I can't ever do the same type of content in my current mindset: I want to maintain a certain body that simply doesn't fit my binge eating behaviour. I'm scared of trying to get back into it and being shamed for participation in diet culture. I feel like I will have to cover up who I have become. Of course I would want do my best to avoid extremely obvious and triggering posts like ""omg this single rice cake with cinnamon and a slice of apple was the best lunch in my life, I feel so full!!!""... I do have some self awareness. But even during that binge era I noticed how easily people would get upset with me and others if my content wasn't 100% fun food. A salad once in a while would be enough to upset a lot of followers- and normal people can totally have salad, especially those with really nice dressings and toppings that easily reach &gt;! 600-900!&lt; cals per serving. I'm really fed up with everyone policing everybody online. Of course problematic content exists: problematic eating behaviour, and problematic body checking. But I think it's super wrong to call out every existing non overweight body and every meal that doesn't equal the typical fun foods/ soul foods/ junk food and then scream ""You're promoting diet culture"". I have always shyed away from showing my body and showing anything close to my personal eating as in ""WIEIAD"" or ""this is the exact amount I would have for dinner"". Always kept it vague because it wasn't about the amounts or the calories or whatever. My content was supposed to be about experience. Taste. Consistency. Excitement. But not the whole body diet whatsoever issue. And I eventually stopped producing content because I was so annoyed with the growing amount of people that would put mean intentions into just everyone's food related actions online.

I was lucky and got a special offer, so I bulk bought like 30Kg of it. I carried it on my own back. And I went there several times because I couldn't carry it all at once but I really wanted to save that money. And now I also put a lot energy into it.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't like almond milk. Usually he's super picky about it. However now that his own plant milks are used up, he needs something for his cereal and so on. Suddenly almond milk becomes the most attractive thing to him. He still doesn't like it but he has been too lazy for like a week to get his own again. And I'm so annoyed.

I never slurp up a whole liter in 1-2 days!\n\nAnd I know I couldn't ever tell him that it upsets me because he probably wouldn't understand. But we have mostly an approach of ""Take care of yourself"". Just figured over time that otherwise, one side would always do more work in the household. Which is ironically happening again, now that I have done great organisation for the thing that I like so much, and saved money, and put energy into, which he all never does for me like that, and just because he's apparently bad at organising himself, I have to suffer from it. I'm mad because he doesn't even value almond milk and all my energy that went into that bulk buy. He's just taking from me because he's being lazy.

But I piterally received a total of 20% of my w in sweets. I don't throw food away because it feels wasteful. And I don't gift it to strangers (I know where I could do that but knowing that someone took their money and good thought to do something extra good for me, I feel like I can't just give it to strangers).\n\nBut I'm trying to cut down on sugar to prevent a binge cycle. And my partner is trying to gain weight. They don't like sweets as much as I do. But sometimes they get a sweet tooth. I put the sweets into nice jars and into their spare time room instead of the kitchen. Out of sight, out of mind- for me. Because otherwise I will snack on every tiny snack that I see and it adds up and later I wonder why I have a stomach bug from just 2-3 little sweets when really I had 50.\n\nLet's see if that works. Today my stomach hurts a lot. The upper part feels swollen (not bloated). And every timy expansion and pressure hurts: deeeeeep breaths. Drinking more than half a cup at once. My last b/p left it's wounds.. Normally I would have a post binge maintenance/low restriction day with a lot of treat yourself cals and some good HIIT in order to escape my binge cycle. Low restriction would only worsen it. I have seen it 10000 times. It's really not worth trying.\n\nBut eating and drinking hurts (well at least then I can't binge either!), and exercising will hurt aswell very likely. I did this to myself 🙃 And I'm taking lessons from it:\n\n- What was my thought process during the different stages of my binge?\n- What did I really need?\n- How could I've prevented it?\n- How could I've interrupted it earlier?\n- What lead to the interruption of it this time?\n- How can I help my body and mind recover now?\n\nThe stomach is getting better. The very beginning has been terrible. But I'm just relieved to see that it's healing on it's own.\n\nI didn't drink enough before my binge. I felt food waste shame, which is what started my binge. I felt overwhelmes by the holidays and the responsibility for so many sweets that I got, which kept it going. I felt curious for just one bite of another snack, which ended in a loop of continously eating small bites. What ended it was physical boundaries. But only when they were already crossed extensively:\nBloat intensifying, nausea when my body automatically started rejecting foods, and aching stomach. Some empty boxes also felt like a finished task. And before my binge, I held back on healthy foods in reasonable amounts. \n\nI should drink more. I shouldn't try to cut down on the real meals. I'm not saving calories anyway. I shouldn't feel forced to finish my plate when I'm full, but especially when it's sweets and I feel like by finishing them now I will help my future self have less sweets at home. I think tea feels really good today. I tried yogurt but it hurt. Smoothie hurt. Curry was a terrible idea, the spices hurt a lot. I should respect myself more, and I will.\n\nIt's not like 🌟ving ever made me sk*nny, did it? All it did, over years, is lead to binge. Sooner or later. Then why suffer anyway.

I don't really care much about her because she was also a bully, talking about how ""fat"" our friend was at a body part that she already was the most insecure about (and at a healthy bmi but that shouldn't even matter...).\n\nBut my real friend and I, we just lost touch after graduation. No bad blood but sometimes you just enter different stages in life, and I think we both didn't really feel like we felt eachother anymore. She was earlier on in her recovery stages. Meanwhile I was still chasing the highs. She had touched the lows, and every time she eventually was ready for recovery but ended in a different shade of ED. But at least they got less and less destructive. She was all about health, maybe a little bit too much about building muscle, when I was still in my Kate Moss era. We tried to stay in touch a few times but it just.. It didn't work. It was weird.

I don't want to get banned so I hope it's ok to post about this here but I think it's mostly a sex thing 😳 My husband and I are in a pretty serious bdsm dynamic (M/s 24/7) and part of that is he gets to control things like whether I get to orgasm/feel pleasure, whether I can use the furniture, how much time I can spend on my phone, etc. I really love the feeling of putting his needs first and only being allowed the bare minimum.\n\nThe only thing he's really not big on is starving me. He worries about my health and he kind of prefers me with more meat on my bones, so I feel super guilty going behind his back by restricting my food. But I really enjoy it and relish being able to cook him delicious meals that I might only eat a bite of, being able to smell the amazing aromas but only be allowed water, and then of course feeling weak and getting hunger pangs and thinking about how it's all because I'm a slave so I don't get to enjoy food.\n\nI really wish he was more ok with me losing at least some weight through heavy restriction/starvation, even if not all the way to my goal weight. I love the idea of him teasing me with food, or punishing me by starving me, or just keeping me locked up and starved because it entertains him to see me getting weaker and more vulnerable. I fantasise a lot about him only feeding me his c*m until I lose a certain amount of weight (can't believe I'm even posting this lol).\n\nI realise this is really taboo territory so I'm probably going to get some downvotes for posting about it - I've tried talking about it in kink subreddits but they don't like it there either because it isn't ""safe, sane, and consensual"" (lots of our dynamic doesn't meet those criteria anyway despite us both being incredibly happy with ourselves and each other).

It drives me nuts, as I’m paying out the butt for a nutritionist, therapist, etc., yet they assume my triggers without consulting me? \n\nWhen I was in IOP, my team assumed that I was working out to compensate for my binges. When I told them time and time again that it merely helped my mood. I worked with a trainer in a residential MH program, and it changed my life in a number of ways. Being active is a very important part of my life and I really hated that they demonized that. I understand that it can effect your appetite/ED urges (so I never brought it up in groups),, but for me that was never the case &amp; wasted most of my therapy disagreeing. If anything, after a week of not working out, I get so depressed &amp; anxious my ED urges go drastically up. \n\nI’m seeing a nutritionist now, whom refuses to use the words “good/bad/control” because he thinks they’ll “subconsciously trigger me”, even though I’ve told him my triggers and whatnot. He has me doing unnecessary exercises &amp; continually asks me why I developed an eating disorder &amp; why I binge - which is a combination of (IMHO), anxiety/my ADHD, hormones being out of whack, and major stomach issues. If he had not been otherwise majorly helpful with my stomach issues I wouldn’t continue going. \n\nIt’s just so frustrating! My triggers are seeing my own weight, feeling too full, over-eating, etc., and I hate the fact that people neglect this. In IOP, I was told to track my number of fats, carbs and proteins - even after explaining over and over that tracking any kind of number is really detrimental to my recovery. I never thought I was fat or ugly (well I hate my skin when I don’t take care of it but nothing pathological), yet I’m treated as though I need to work on body image and self acceptance. \n\nHas anybody else had this experience? I’m always very skeptical of mental health programs that claim to be individualized for that reason. \n\nDisclaimer: I understand that for some EDs, much like with addiction, there are strict protocols you have to follow in order to recover &amp; there’s a problem with some people, not wanting to recover &amp; deception.

2779,whateveridontcareeeo,t5_2zzq8,"I remember being 10 when I became anxious of what I ate. I was 65 pounds and 5 feet tall. People looked at me in fear, concern, sadness. I just didn’t see it-but in a way I did. I hated getting my photo taken. Going to the mall to try on jeans was my nightmare, and holiday dinners were scary. I avoided cameras. Wore clothes that were 4 times my size. Drowning in the fabric to hide my body. People mistaken me for a boy, as I hide under the size 36 jeans. I avoided the happiness and pleasure people sought by sharing meals. It sucked. I was angry about it. I was bitter. I didn’t know why I felt this way, as I saw kids enjoy cake at birthday parties. I was confused when they asked for seconds. Did they realize how many calories were in that? About 300. Did they know that that slice was actually 2.5 servings? Nope. They’re children, why would they know that? Did they know how many grams of fat, carbohydrates, and sugar were in that cake? 22, 36, and 40. And that there was little to no fiber, meaning that cake was going to be stored in that kid for a few hours, and with limited activity before and after that said cake was that those itty bitty grams of fat and sugar were going to multiply and turn into lipids. Those lipids are fat. Fat is bad. Sugar is bad. You’ll be able to see it. In their face, on their arms, their ankles. They won't be a size small anymore, or a double zero. They’ll be miserable, and resentful towards that cake. The sight of cake will be ruined for them endlessly; haunting them in their sleep, when they shower, when they see themselves. They’ll look back at that party as nothing but a regretful and detrimental decision. They will be nothing but the sentiment of that cake. Fat, grotesque, and undesirable. That single piece of cake ruined it all. This was how my brain operated. \n\nAs I grew older, it only became worse, until one night my ballet teacher called my mom and told her I needed to get help. That was the most angriest I’ve been at my mom, driving me through detoured streets getting me to the hospital. It was right after hurricane sandy, and the world seemed apocalyptic. Trees were on the streets, no one had power, and the sense of fear and loss was held by every person. I thought my mother was crazy even thinking about my weight during a tragedy as such, but she was sensing the greatest loss of all. Slowly, she was losing her child. I was dying before her eyes. My heart was failing. “Why can't it be easy?” She probably thought. I was this dubious, angsty, sad kid. I punished myself for the world's mistakes. I was the scapegoat for my family's problems. I had no control, but only over myself. So I decided to just let myself die. She’d look at me, to such disappointment, and I’d run to my room to do push ups. I’d wake up in the middle of the night to go running, I would check my stomach 40 times a day-after every sip and bite of food. My eating disorder turned from just an entity, to becoming me. It was a personality trait of mine. I was being identified with it. I was the one in the family who had an eating disorder, and I was the reason my siblings and friends couldn’t say certain things. I was a burden, and not a person- I felt like I was their problem. \n\nI felt like I was living the narrative of a Bukowski poem. I hated things. I was so angry. I looked at people enjoying their lunch, and muttered to myself “why can’t I have that”. Why can’t I feel happiness, guiltless, blamelessly, with pure innocent intention when taking a bite of pasta. But there was something greater than that, some finger to point, someone to be held captive-and it was always, invariably me. I chewed my food and spit it out. This became a function of surviving.\n\nThere is a lot of shame that is imputed on addicts, anorexics, and bulimics. I was looked at with my disease. People said “I’m sorry” when I told them about it, and it shifted their perception of me. I became this sensitive soul, this hurt being. A fake, artificial niceness to spare me. I didn’t feel like a real person, but a commodity of someone's moral duty. \n\n“Be nice to the anorexic girl, because in a way you’re saving her.” Fucking bullshit. \n\nRecovery for anorexics is similar to any substance abuse addict. Relapse is part of the process. Failing is a part of learning-or learning is a part of learning.\n\nI went to rehab. Gained 30 pounds, and felt pretty good about myself. I was able to eat two servings of ice cream at the end of the day, and not question it. Not think poorly of it. Not resent it. It’s not the ice creams fault. I would look at my brother and ask, “should I have more”, and he would give me the sweetest two worded response: why not? It was so uncomplicated. So easy. \n\nBut then I was reminded that I wasn’t easy. I was the youngest, the outcast of my family. I never felt like I looked like any of them. We had different interests, different thoughts of the world. I sparked debate, question, and disagreement. 3 vs 1. I was the lone soldier on the team. A team of only me, and I accepted that and embraced it. I liked being then different one. I wore all black when they wore nothing but color. They had it all together, I was gripping the seams closed. They liked Bruce Springstein, and I liked Black Flag. My sister was girly. I was not. I wanted to live in New York, and I smoked, and did drugs. My brother was always presentable, and my sister always wore makeup. I never wore a bra. My face was always bare. And I was looked at with “skinny” as the first adjective. I looked at baby pictures of me. I never smiled. I looked stern and serious. The tortured artist. \n\nBeing told you’re skinny as a  “functioning anorexic” is the most confusing thing to us. You would think men would say it as if they are sparing you their very last dollar. I was supposed to basq in that. Cry tears of joy. Be astonished, and rewarded. It’s something that they would only say to me when I was naked with them. They seemed uncomfortable when I didn’t react. They were having sex with an anorexic girl. And I think for some of them, it was bothersome. Concern was once again, apparent. I wasn’t desirable at my lowest weight. What more could I do? I sat there, bare and vulnerable and numbed by their fear. I scared people, and that was beginning to scare me.\n\nI think the greatest most impressionable thing that was ever said to me, was that there isn’t a cure for eating disorders. You have it forever. The permanence of anything is daunting. It can seem inextricable, and as if there isn’t a happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel. And some days, and many days, that’s how I feel. I feel ashamed, burdensome, expensive, aggravating towards the ones helping me on this. Am I wasting their money? Am I wasting their time? Am I worth it? But in the moments of uncertainty and hopelessness, I remember that because there is no end, that means there is nothing permanent. These moments will not be forever. And the days where I feel like tearing off my skin, hiding under my blanket, and screaming through my sheets, will turn into warm grassy days at the park. The swelling will subside, and there will be moments when I’ll feel nothing but kisses on my face. I’ll have a piece of cake- no dissection. Just enjoyment, forgivingly celebrating a moment, my progress, music, art, maybe the sun? I’ll celebrate pianos, photos, flowers, and even the color green. ",1586735869,To my Anorexic Self,"[0.00042017283143580455, 0.027490924132560303, 0.14494384935635884, 0.19201799634289016, 0.11175824481017346, 0.02785955151845342, 0.12697120646370205, 0.21595180237072073, 0.04731266635567237, 0.10527358581803285]"

Please don't read on if you're not in a place to handle that right now.** Please also note that this post is very stupid and I'm honestly embarrassed that it hurt me enough that I felt the need to make a post about it. \n\nSo, look. We all know which sub I'm talking about. I won't name it because I don't want to encourage brigading and also it is totally within their rights for them to enforce any rule they see fit. I understand why they've done this, especially considering the amount of heat they get from subs like these. But - one of the most popular 'dieting lifestyle' subs, or whatever you want to call it, banned people with a history of eating disorders today. They have categorically stated that we're not welcome and will be permabanned if we have a post history that mentions having an eating disorder. \n\nI know most people here hate that sub. I know many people who have only ever had a restrictive disorder feel some kind of way about it and I totally respect that. If that is the case, you may want to dip out here. I loved that sub and I genuinely believe it saved my life. \n\nI'll skip the novel, but the cliff notes version is that I was neglected and abused in many ways throughout my childhood. I got out lacking some very basic self care skills. I was diagnosed with anorexia pretty young. I attempted to recover without any real professional help and went on to develop bulimia instead. I had no idea how moderation worked - I'm an all or nothing type of guy. I was never taught about nutrition, portion control, food groups, when to eat, how much to eat, when to stop, what counts as binging, what counts as restriction. When I developed bulimia my life spiralled and my health took a very sudden turn for the worst. My days revolved around food and guilt and misery.  \n\nI discovered **that** lifestyle by accident, and with it I discovered **that** sub. I swear to you that shit saved my life. I lurked for years, never really contributed a lot, and I'm not sure if I ever even posted there on this account. But that lifestyle saved me and gave me the skills to keep me afloat. I know that attracts a lot of eye rolls from people who say that lifestyle is impossible for someone with an ED to maintain safely, but it taught me *actual* self control, not the bullshit anorexic version I had before. \n\nIt taught me how to take care of myself by setting reasonable boundaries - introducing boundaries to my life was a genuine act of self love and turned shit around for me both in terms of eating and other acts of excess. That lifestyle taught me how to reduce and eventually cut out binging entirely - because I knew when to eat and when not to. It was as simple as that and it sounds stupid but I was literally never taught that. Through that community I found out a lot of the basics like how much you should be eating in the first place. It also taught me that you don't go on restricting indefinitely - that you *can* end your restriction and it *isn't* a failure. It can be a positive thing and it's a healthy cycle when done correctly. \n\nNow, granted, I've relapsed and I currently restrict unhealthily once again. But that has more to do with my current personal circumstances. It has nothing to do with that lifestyle - I stepped away from it when I relapsed because to me it was healthy and a relapse is not healthy. \n\nAnyway. It is so ***incredibly*** stupid to feel hurt by this and I know it. Mods there said themselves it isn't their job to parent us - and I respect that. It just hurts because in a lot of ways, I did feel very safe browsing over there. I did learn skills I should have learned from parents. I do feel hurt from this that is definitely disproportionate. When I read that we were unwelcome there it genuinely physically hurt me for a second which is such a stupid reaction. I've just lost something that meant a lot to me - which is stupid because I only ever lurked anyway. \n\nIt feels like I've got to genuinely mourn the fact that I'm not welcome in the first place that gave me stability with my eating. It was the first time I ever thought about recovery and it was the first time I ever got to a point where I was genuinely in control. It hurts to have that place make an enemy of people like me when it was such a positive thing for me. \n\nLook, I'm so sorry to have made a post like this and it's honestly embarrassing that I felt the need to make this. I feel a little better just from explaining why I felt hurt by something that seems so stupid. It just hit me pretty hard in a way I wasn't expecting. It probably isn't about the sub - it's probably deeper than that and I should raise these feelings with my therapist. Obviously, not the job of anyone on the internet to accommodate anything or anyone they don't want to, and I take responsibility for these immature feelings - this isn't the fault of anyone over on that sub, this is entirely on me. \n\nI just wanted to share these feelings with a group who might understand them in some way. On the positive side, I can still take away those coping mechanisms and skills I learned from that sub and implement them in my future recovery. I haven't lost any of the skills I learned in my time there.

2811,xStingx,t5_2tmc8,"Hi, everyone! A while back I made a post here about how I stopped purging and lost weight. I received a lot of heartwarming comments on that post and was happy to know that I gave a lot of people some hope. Well, it's been three months since I moved back in with my mom and since purging in her home required a lot more effort than it did when I lived alone, I managed to just stop purging altogether. Honestly, it was easier than I thought it would be. I had to move out of my apartment due to financial issues and I knew moving back in with my mom, I would probably gain some weight. For a long time, I thought I would never be able to stop purging. I thought I would just grow old and purge until I died. Obviously, this was not the case. Now, don't get me wrong, I did go through the stages of grief before I stopped. I cried quite a bit because purging was not just weight loss for me, it was a way to make me feel like I was saving myself from being that very overweight girl I was a few years ago. But... I accepted my defeat and pushed on, in hopes that this was all for the better. So flash forward to a few weeks after my last post. I ended up purging again. I relapsed. 🫠🫠🫠Except this time, it felt pretty unnecessary. Like, yeah, I felt lighter after but not better, y'know?  Usually after purging, I yearn to feel that *better* feeling and this time I didn't. So i forgave myself and went forward without purging again. \n\n\nYou hear a lot of stories about people who stop purging and end up gaining massive amounts of weight. You hear that you'll be bloated, depressed, and likely to relapse. I want to tell you that none of the above is more important than you so why even entertain or give power to them?  I'm also here to tell you that not all of those things are true anyway. I am proof that you can stop right now and still be the you that you want to be. Yes, you might relapse, yes you might bloat, yes you might wake up a few days later wanting to yell at the world and disappear but fuck, I deal with all that even without bulimia. 😂 But no, really. Bulimia used to be cute for me. I ate that shit up (literally, ahahaha).  Why? Because at the time, I wanted to be its friend. It was fun, relatively easy, and because I felt like it was doing some secret life hack that noone knew about. Now it's a whole different story since I'm done and it doesn't want to break up with me. Give your bulimia the ""we need to talk"" conversation and see how well it takes it. 🫣 Oop--\n\nEveryday is an uphill battle. \n\nBut also, everyday WAS a... ""Not me over here purging up the two biscuits, three licorices, and six potato wedges just to lose six ounces that comes right back after drinking the much needed bottle of water my body is screeching for since I'm now dehydrated.""  type day. Rinse and repeat. \n\n\nI come to you now as a slightly changed woman who still may not know her worth but can finish a normal dinner plate without the urge to be baptized by toilet water afterwards. \n\nIn conclusion, I'm not telling you to stop purging right now. It's your life and we all know giving up an addiction isn't rainbows and butterflies. But I am saying that recovery isn't grey skies and spiderwebs either. Come to the dark side, there's low cal cookies over here.😶‍🌫️ 🥹 Jk, but no...\n\nMeet me in the middle. \nIt may not be greener over here but it sure is a nice view. 💙",1673904193,Update about quitting purging.

2812,xStingx,t5_2tmc8,"So. I decided to give up bulimia. Well, to be honest,  I didn't have a choice. I moved in with my mother due to financial hardship and at first, I tried to purge but it was too complicated seeing as her room is right next to the bathroom. I stopped cold turkey and decided that this was a way out. \n\nI've also not binged. It's surprising that it was that easy but all I had to do was really trust myself. I gave myself certain foods that I could eat that made me feel comfortable enough not to purge and that really helped. I still eat things I really like but I have to remind myself that If I binge, I will want to purge and I'm so tired of feeling bloated, dry, dizzy, depressed, and ashamed from purging. Also, my teeth were really shrinking it seemed. \n\nI also preoccupied myself with a sport/hobbies. I've started running and I'm using the time I spent binging and purging to put more time into learning a language I've been working on advancing in this year.\n\nI know what you're thinking! ”You're running, that's why you lost weight."" Wrong. I've only just started running about a week ago and it's only been one mile which only burns about 100 calories. Also, I injusted myself running so I haven't run in four days now and I got on the scale this morning and I lost weight. \n\nIf you're scared to stop purging. Don't be.

And if my eating habits change, that could spell trouble in the presence of increased exercise.\n\nConsidering my analysis here, and my nonstop mental calculator, you’d think I’d be better at calculus.

But now I understand why she always praises strength, muscle, and “enjoying yourself” with foods you like. Essentially, she’s a really, really body-positive and supportive person whose biggest priority has always been my health and happiness.\n\nAnd now, after all those years of her endless positivity and support, I feel myself slipping into it. I don’t want to, but it seems completely beyond my control. Especially moving out and living alone, buying my own food, it just feels impossible not to.\n\nI just feel bad for my mom. That everything she said and did didn’t help. That it happened anyway, despite her efforts to the contrary. I hate that she’d understand.

He's 6 for, but I'm only 5' 1"", I feel so triggered and my brain is just obsessed with extended water fasting as the magic and fast solution. So I want to water fast for a minimum of 14 days while my therapist and friends are on holiday.\n\nMeanwhile, I have to start studying again in 2 weeks, and I'm volunteering one day per week and I need to be able to function.
