7171,EDAnonymous,"I have this college friend who's 4 years younger than me  and she confided in me last fall that she's been struggling with an ED. I told her (briefly) about my history with an ED and that I was in recovery (quasi recovery but I didn't say that). I also urged her to get help and she went into treatment last month. 

Well, we went out to eat yesterday and she said she left treatment because she ""just wants to do 1 on 1 with a therapist"". I'm pretty sure she's restricting because she ate her food really, really fast. I don't mean that in a critical way, it's just that when I only ate like that when I was hardcore restricting. 

Then she said, ""I'm going to throw this up"" and when I acted concerned, she said some excuse that it ""didn't agree with her"". I wasn't really sure how to respond so I changed the subject but she continued talking about how the food ""didn't agree with her"" even though we hung out for another 30 minutes and she didn't seem nauseous at all.

It was actually really triggering for me (though I didn't tell her) and I'm not sure what to do. I don't really want to hang out with her anymore if she's going to keep acting like that (while making no effort to get better) and I think something about me triggers her as well (though I've NEVER restricted in front of her or talked about specifics with my ED).

I have been at a BMI of &gt;!15.4!&lt; for over 15 years. Sometimes a little lower or higher, but in that ballpark at least. I‚Äôm now 41 and have the following fairly severe health issues related to my low weight:
1) Macrocytic anemia: I guess this is normally associated with alcoholics, but my red cells are very large and can‚Äôt carry oxygen like normal. I‚Äôm constantly exhausted and it affects my mental capacity as well. 

2) Permanent gut issues: I either have diarrhea or constipation that lasts weeks with intermittent periods of normal pooping. It could be much worse considering how long I abused laxatives, but it‚Äôs still bad enough to affect my daily life.

3) Severe osteoporosis: I have the bones of a 75 year old lady. I‚Äôm terrified to fall because I‚Äôll likely break a hip.

4) Mental clarity: I struggle at work with distractions and forgetting things a lot.  It really affects my job performance and it‚Äôs extremely frustrating.

7603,EDAnonymous,"So I thought I might share it with you. Whoever needs this now. I needed it back then. I felt like life was meaningless and like I had no purpose, with issues that go beyond ED but are often accompanying it. I felt like I liked nothing in life. I watched yt and a video had this ad that I somehow couldn't skip. I had to listen closer. It was such a beautiful ad.
There were so many different people. Everyone in their own frame, in their own environment, their own style,... And every single one of these people said:

""Trust me, it gets better.""

""It gets better.""

""It really gets better!""

So so so many people. And not only hearing the words but also the way they said it in their relieved or happy or calm melody. And the way their mimic went.

I felt like, if they all defeated their lowest point... Why wouldn't I?

I think that ad was one of the first pushes into a direction of allowing myself to get into a better headspace. And you know what? Life did get better. It really did. My life has meaning and purpose now. Not because I found it but because I created it. I discovered so many things, feelings, people, impressions, animals, fruits, sunsets, strengths, weaknesses,..... Didn't think I would ever be one to find beauty in small things. I would always despise those people back then. Well... What can I say. Life really did get better.

I just remembered this sentence today for the first time in nearly a decade now. And you know what's a bit funny? This ad was not even aimed at me. No, really it was about LGBTQ+ and coming out. I hope it gave LGBTQ+ people at least the same amount of hope and strength. It was not aimed at me but in that moment, it really spoke to me. Because that was just what I needed.

7621,EDAnonymous,"So here is my story/situation. 

So in my past I used to self harm. I‚Äôm 30 years old not and I haven‚Äôt self harmed since I was 17-18 I don‚Äôt remember. Now the thought of it triggers me to feint and feel really lightheaded like I was experiencing it again. I had been diagnosed with depression and dysthymia before I rejected treatment altogether. I haven‚Äôt been on medication as well since then as well. I felt that my experimentation with drugs like weed, psychedelics, ecstasy, and a little bit of meth had rattle me enough to really appreciate life. Less so with the meth, but it showed me a dark reality in my friends who really dove deep into that and that scared me enough to stay away from it. I experienced the same thing with ecstasy somewhat too though I find that it under the right conditions it can be used therapeutically. Same goes for psychedelics but that‚Äôs a whole other discussion. My point is that I don‚Äôt do drugs anymore beside smoke weed and occasionally take shrooms when I feel that I need to rewire my brain. 


The first time some one brought up the word eating disorder in my life was my pediatrician when I was 17. I was 5‚Äô2‚Äù 115 my heaviest and I had lost weigh to 105 pretty rapidly because at that time I didn‚Äôt really eat and I was out partying. I thought at my heaviest I thought maybe I was a little chubby and sure some places I felt a little less happy about. But I never felt I looked fat or ugly really. I also had many bf‚Äôs throughout highschool or people interested in me. But yeah my doctor brought it up and I told her no and I don‚Äôt know why I lost this weight ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. But I switched doctors before exploring it further. 

Fast forward to 22 I end up hospitalized for like a week because I couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up. I think it started with a cell tech drink for your muscles after I was done exercising. Well I kept throwing up all night and I think it caused ulcers to form from so anything that went down would cause me to throw up. I lived on a gerd diet and took medication for like a year. My weight at the lowest was 92 lbs and I felt that I looked too skinny. Around that time earlier I had an abortion so I don‚Äôt know if it happened because I was stressed out about my relationship. It was a good healthy relationship overall. But I was hurt by him asking me to not go through with having a baby. He was 25. I don‚Äôt hold it against him because I also didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúready‚Äù. 

Eventually I breakup with this bf and now I‚Äôm in another relationship. I‚Äôm happy but my weight still bothers me. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù and I weigh 103-105lbs. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just lazy but I don‚Äôt have an appetite most of the time. I‚Äôve increased my meals from 1 to 2-3 meals because I was tired and sleeping a lot. Plus I started working so I had a schedule and a routine. But now I own my own business which means I make my own schedule which means I‚Äôm lazier than ever. Lol ironic right. I have an awareness now that I need to eat or I will loose weight which has become a fear. But here‚Äôs the weird part. When I start to gain weigh and get closer to my goal. Which is 115. I start to feel like the fat isn‚Äôt distributing where I would want it. So then I start worrying about that and start cutting out unhealthy foods like fast food, salt and bread. Then when I have moments of depression I don‚Äôt eat. It a way I feel like it‚Äôs my passive way of self harming. But then after I‚Äôm over it I start trying to eat a healthier balance again because I feel scared of losing weight. 

I have an aversion to fast food because I‚Äôm afraid of getting sick again too. Like I feel like oily foods cause acid reflux and I‚Äôm afraid of throwing up like I did when I got sick. But I also binge on these foods from time to time and I feel gross about it. Like I get nauseous from thinking about it. 

I never considered that I might have an eating disorder but recently I‚Äôve been reading some of these ed forums out of curiosity and seeing a lot of parallels makes me question if I have one as well and never knew?",,Do I have an ed?,1,,story time,,,,t5_rbmui,10m08hp,1,Acrobatic-Move6552,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10m08hp/do_i_have_an_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10m08hp/do_i_have_an_ed/,1674761458,782,1,0,0
7637,EDAnonymous," 

So my church has a weekly potluck lunch and for awhile I‚Äôd just avoid eating much because it‚Äôs hard to feel safe, even when I track, if it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs food. But then brilliant me had an idea.

My ED is a small part influenced by guilt about money and spending it on food on me specifically. So I decided, heck, this is free food, I‚Äôll OMAD it and that‚Äôll be that. Then I upped my limit for that OMAD, from &gt;!up to 800!&lt; to &gt;!1200.!&lt; Basically allowing myself to ‚Äúbinge‚Äù once a week with some decreased guilt on all levels. 

But here‚Äôs where the fuckup begins. Last time, or some time recently, I ended up triggering an actual binge that lasted a few days because of this OMAD where I kept going back into the kitchen for more pieces of everything, no shame whatsoever. Ok maybe a little but my feral, food-obsessed brain was stronger, for once, than my social anxiety. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve been back to mid/high res which is my usual goal, and then this week I‚Äôm not really even that hungry coming into the lunch. It‚Äôs smaller, too, not as many people, so not as many different options. And it‚Äôs spaghetti etc which is high cal in SUCH low amounts, which is, obviously, quite scary. 

I didn‚Äôt even need to try to skip breakfast (helped that I slept in) and I wasn‚Äôt thinking I even wanted much so I got a small plate. Not by ED standards but by general standards it was small. 

I can‚Äôt remember when the shift happened, but I unlocked this binge urge, though I resisted throughout the times I gave in too. Meaning, I had a second piece of garlic bread but not a fourth. (Wow, such willpower.) 

And then I end up grabbing a bowl of veggies (which I ate a decent amount of anyway because cherry tomatoes can GET IT and it was the best celery I‚Äôd ever tasted for some reason) and walking around with it in an attempt to satisfy the binge urges by volume eating. I‚Äôd already eaten what was basically maintenance so I was trying to ease out of a mindset where I‚Äôd keep eating. 

So I go and do some random games with some friends and I lose the urge to keep shoveling bread in my mouth like a starved Victorian orphan. 

But of course, it doesn‚Äôt end here, because I‚Äôm still at maintenance and the universe apparently wishes me ill. 

Someone decides it‚Äôll be a great idea to get ice cream. And I make some excuses about allergies but it doesn‚Äôt work and I eat an ice cream cone. Not gonna lie, it was amazing. I haven‚Äôt had one in a while just because it‚Äôs winter as well as for obvious reasons. And I enjoyed it. I refused to let myself NOT enjoy it, because I was basically forced to eat it. (Not really but I can‚Äôt walk over and throw away an ice cream cone in front of the person who gave it to me. And no matter what YOU would do, I‚ÄôM not going to shove it in my pocket :) üòâ)

So it was a good cone. And it was a bad occurrence. Because it re-aroused the binge beast and I had to get another bowl of lettuce to avoid tipping the table into my mouth. 

Fortunately when I left the room again and then came back with a bit of binge intentions, the food had already been cleaned up. 

But now I get in the car with my family and my parents are starving because they didn‚Äôt eat much. So we go get some snacks at the store and I get given a portion, which, again, I have no convenient hidey-hole in which to shove. 

So I end up at &gt;!2,000!&lt; which I‚Äôm like, fuck. But ok, I did a lot of exercise playing games so I‚Äôm probably ok just for today. And I think I‚Äôm done and I should be satisfied, RIGHT??

But then I feel the need to eat, not 1, not 2, nor yet again 3. Not even 4, but FIVE protein bars which are NOT low calorie. I‚Äôm running around doing chores literally ravenous and stifling moans of hunger while I shove these protein bars in my mouth. 

Then I think I‚Äôm done. I did a few reps of weights so I can feel like I‚Äôm gaining something good from this insane saga. Hey, if I‚Äôm going to eat &gt;!3,500!&lt; might as well get them gains, right? :,)

Exercise can generally turn off some of my binge urges so I think I‚Äôm good.

Then, I have no recollection how, I decided to eat just o\^n\^e more thing. Maybe it was because I still have this weird belief I have to eat the protein after I workout or else it won‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs not true, right? ü§®

To make a very long story shorter, I ended up spooning sunflower butter, after carefully measuring and then just saying, screw it im eating from the jar, as the fam walks into the room. So we leave to go somewhere else and for 15 minutes after we leave I‚Äôm thinking about this food and I‚Äôm wishing I had brought it. Then I lose the urge to eat and I‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt bring it. 

Then we come home and I‚Äôm stupid so I eat a little bit of what I don‚Äôt necessarily feel a huge urge to eat but I do feel somewhat hungry and everyone else is having snacks so I have one too. 

I have to mention, at this point my stomach is quite full, kind of hard from all the food packed in it, but I‚Äôm still HUNGRY. I‚Äôm freaking ravenous. That was how I felt the entire day when I felt this insane urge to eat and eat and eat. 

Anyway, I eat snacks with my siblings, and I end the day at a glorious &gt;!4,300!&lt; cals. Dude. 

The thing is, I know that todays weight isn‚Äôt real, just food weight, but I also know that this brought my week‚Äôs average almost up to a point where it doesn‚Äôt even out to me restricting at all. 

But I still can‚Äôt feel that much guilt or panic, which in a sense is good, but so, so odd. 

Not sure if I‚Äôve started a binge/restrict cycle, so pretty scared of that, but I haven‚Äôt yet decided what to do about today. Should I ease down by eating maintenance and lowering, or should I go back to normal mid-high res? I guess I‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôm still full from yesterday and I have to focus on ‚ú®life‚ú® what a glorious concept. Other things are boring but my ed always have something interesting to throw at me ü§™üò≠

7798,EDAnonymous,"Honestly, not sure what my problem is. For a while I‚Äôve thought I was just really concerned about being in shape. My gf at the time expressed concerns over my obsessive dieting and exercise. Being able to guesstimate calories just by looking at a dish fairly accurately. Now that I‚Äôm in the military I‚Äôm praised for looking like I‚Äôm in good shape, I‚Äôm not big by any means, just very lean and fast. I‚Äôve been eating eggs, chicken, vegetables, and mashed potatoes religiously every day. If I eat something other than the foods I listed I get pretty bad stomach aches, I usually just end up throwing it up, usually by choice, other times it just comes back up. Like I can eat other foods within reason, like small amounts of fruit, small amounts of candy, small amounts of soda, raw fish/sushi, however, too much of even those things I get physically I‚Äôll. But other things like pastas, sandwiches, burgers will 100% make me feel ill. I usually just fast for 24 hours 5 days a week, eat about 3-5 plates of chicken and vegetables and on the weekends I‚Äôll eat some breakfast foods like eggs and hash browns and maybe some bacon. If I stray from this diet it causes this weird itch in my brain and I feel the need to punish myself by fasting, generous amount of exercise, or purging if it doesn‚Äôt come back up on its own. I use black coffee to help me feel full and keep my body in a ketogenic state while fasting. I don‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm starving, I have a pretty good physique but I have terrible body dysmorphia.

I go from being nice to myself and absolutely despising myself or somewhere in between every 2 hours and during the ""good"" hours I'm also more likely to allow myself to eat, only to be angry at myself during the bad hours again and it's just so exhausting to think it's fine to eat and then blaming myself right after


The whole thing started 2 years ago as a result of some other issues (difficult past and funny lockdown), I had so much time to myself and so much control but after a while I cracked and got into therapy, and from therapy I went into hospital where I basically did nothing but almost go back to my original weight. Thanks, still hate myself!


And now I started a new school and it's difficult af for me to push through, I like the school itself and I'm trying my best but damn...I just keep on comparing myself to 14-15y/os (I'm a bit older than my classmates, I'm 18) who ofc don't have a ""matured"" body yet, and I know this but I just feel so disgusting next to them, I feel so terrible after every meal, I feel like I'm being watched and judged all the time and like someone's gonna start talking behind my back like ""hey have you seen how much they ate! what a whale!!!"" or even THINK anything like ""o yea the adult person in our class with a matured body, that's them"" (them being me) but I know they wouldn't because they're nice people, still don't trust anyone :/ I also took my scale and measuring tape from home with me to school (it's a boarding school so I live there when it's not the weekend) and yeah I just know how much that's gonna destroy me, fun!

I used to restrict and when I got malnourished enough I'd have uncontrollable binge episodes followed by purging. One of my tools for recovery had been stopping restricting entirely. That has been really helpful. I've also had to address how food is an addiction to me. Why I eat certain foods rather than things that are actually good for me. Its been a long painful journey along side having parents who are addicts to other more damaging substances.

Sorry, Idk how to edit the tag on mobile please don't kill me :c

Today I cooked for my gfs family. This is not unusual, I love cooking and I'm a pretty decent cook (maybe because I have a food obsession hahah). So when they all came home I had just finished making lunch so I asked my gf how many dishes I had to serve. She answered ""Six. Well... Are you going to eat?"" and I asked her if she was counting on me in those six people or not, and I told her that I didn't really feel like eating. She knows I worry about her and what she eats because I don't want her to end up like me, and she has had body image issues in the past. So she said ""Then just serve 4"" and I was like is she not going to eat either? And I asked her why, she asked the same thing to me and I was getting really stressed, she went on ""You HAVE TO eat something! You didn't eat anything yesterday!"", so I got really mad about all the pressure she was putting on me by basically saying I'm forced to eat today. I didn't want to make a scene in front of her family and I don't want them to know I have issues with food, so I just told her that ""Okay, I will fucking eat, ffs"". I served myself a huge fucking dish and sat on the table. I ended up binging once everyone left the table because I was so annoyed, I got even more annoyed when she came to the kitchen and kept staring at me the whole time I was eating, it makes me feel so guilty and disgusting. So I just left whatever I was binging on there in the table and ran to our room. She came after me and asked me why would I get mad at her for just asking me to eat. Also at this point I must have developed gerd or something and ended up throwing up from eating so much, and she knows this always happens.

I felt like she was pressuring me so much, but maybe she was on the right and I should feel happy that she worries about me?

8360,EDAnonymous,"It usually occurs when I've fasted for too long. I'm dead exhausted but simultaneously eager to cook for my sister. Like I have too much brain fog to do anything else but just enough gone to be a chef.  I'll just go into her room, offer to prepare something, and if she says yes, then I'll suggest what I'm craving at the moment. We have similar tastes. And then I'll suggest side A or side B, and then another side C or side D. I don't force her to overeat, or at least I think I don't because I try not to. And then I'll obsess over making it look restaurant quality.   


Examples below (TLDR: perfect finger food, cookies/milk, and spaghetti)

&amp;#x200B;

* One day she simply agreed with a corndog and fries, so I spent a good minute finding a *very* specific and good-looking plate that would fit everything *perfectly*, and folding paper towels into triangles to tuck behind the corndogs, and adding the condiments in a near-perfect zigzag, and wrapping extra silverware in a paper towel, and finding a straw for an iced drink. 
* Another day I heard she made honor roll, so I felt like congratulating her with her favorite brand of cookies because I was craving them, so I put them flat on a plate, under a paper towel, and made an iced strawberry milk. Included the milk because it's rare to make it.
* Another day I made spaghetti, with the garnish and shredded cheese and 3 perfectly placed meatballs. Added this because I never make spaghetti, and I haven't made spaghetti since.

Weird thing is I'll completely avoid the food. When it's an average day and I'm making something, and I allow myself to, I'll usually have bites as I make it. On these days, I'm just intensely staring at the pan/oven/etc as I make it, and I *hover* over my sister as I ask for her approval. And hearing her praise makes me feel full. Watching her take the first bite and be happy feels like I've eaten the whole meal.

on a side note, i developed gastric pain as a sensitive reaction towards imbalanced food intake around the time after i starved myself drastically. and now i cant starve myself without having explosive diarrhea. its physically painful to have to go through that because of starvation, but its mentally and emotionally painful when i have to live in this body i hate, and this state of mind and personality that i hate. why arent i normal? people say no one is truly normal, but i still feel like an outcast because of what i am. i disgust myself. some people look at me and seem disgusted too. i wish could die in my sleep. that would be a blessing.

I was a stay at home mom for years, in a country I moved to when I had my baby, so I didn't know many people. Initially I made friends at parent and baby groups and things like that, but the friendships sort of tapered off when the parents returned to work. My son started primary school and I was bored. I got a job and made friends with my coworkers. It was great. I felt so social and normal. The company is in trouble (because the boss in a complete tool). All my friends got laid off, and they dropped me. I am disproportionately upset. I am heartbroken. I have rubbed the skin under my eyes raw from wiping my tears. I feel like I should just quit and maybe they would be my friends again, but they aren't going to, are they? Maybe we weren't really friends, and I was just pathetically clinging to them because I missed having a group of women to hang out with.

Coincidentally around the time that I started to develop my ED, he started watching his diet too‚Äîfor legitimate health reasons, though (high blood pressure). Because of this, he started making filling healthy meals that are like the nutritionally sufficient versions of my safe meals.

Just by coincidence, his cooking became my safe space. His meals are the one time I‚Äôm not afraid of oil or sauce, because the portions and vegetables are well balanced. And seasoned so freaking well, like it‚Äôs actually delicious.

He doesn‚Äôt know about my ED. But he respects when I have a small portion of his meals, as long as I have a bit of everything. He never comments on my looks, and only cares about my health.

9294,EDAnonymous,"I've never really been sure exactly when my issues with food/ my body started, but I generally pin it down to the 2012/2013 summer (am australian) time period, when I was 6. I've been thinking about it a lot recently. It's hard to remember much before I was 6/7, so it feels like I've been disordered my entire life. I've bounced around pretty much every ED on the planet since then. It was never as bad as it is now, but I look back on how my attitude towards all of this has been, and it's never been good. 

I remember becoming obsessed with the concept of diet culture/dieting in general when I was 9, and cutting and keeping the chart on the back of the packaging for a set of pajamas that had the average waist measurements for kids per age. Being in year one or two (ages 7/8) and the teacher asking what one thing we'd change about ourselves and my first thought being my weight. That's not what I said though. I was ashamed of wanting that. I think I said my height or my eye colour. 

I like to think that I would never have gotten an eating disorder if I was a cis guy. But having developed those thoughts so early makes me wonder if it's just an inherent part of me. I've pretty much given up on the idea of recovery until I'm transitioned, because it's physically impossible for me to look anything how I want until I've been on testosterone for a while, and had reassignment surgery, but a part of me is scared that my eating disorder is just there now. Always going to be part of who I am. Maybe I can just never recover fully. I don't want another fucking decade of this, but I have no idea how to exist or who I am without it.

This girl I knew came up to me in Biology and started asking me questions about losing weight. She wanted to know everything, started sitting with me at lunch and asked for tips on ignoring hunger. Hindsight I shouldn't have openly given her tips and advice but I was 16 and had just had a falling out with my best friend who also struggled with an ed so I was excited by the possibility for a new codependent ed based friendship.  

Sometimes I think about this whole scenario and I am left with so many questions. 

How did she know I have an ed? Was it that obvious just from looking at me? I never felt like it was obvious enough for people to notice.

I think about how if she noticed, how others at my school didn't. Specifically, how is it possible that this one girl who was barely an acquaintance noticed I was heavily starving myself, but not one teacher, administrator or adult in my life did? 

Maybe they did notice. But if they did, why did none of them reach out or show any form of support? 

I left public school that year so that I could homeschool myself (independent  study) and focus 100% on my ed. 

I am sitting here, 12 years later, still actively in the grips of a restrictive ed unable to face even the thought of recovery. I truly wonder how my life would be different if an adult around me had showed concern. Maybe it wouldn't have mattered but I still wonder.

On the other side when I'm staying in my basement apartment during the week for some reason i nearly never have an urge to binge. Quite the opposite i slowly evolved an restrictive ed, i also feel rather lonely there, the owners of the house are friends of my parents but they are extremely perfectionistic in their cleaning habits and their view of a nice home, which is their right because im living in their house after all but it really makes me uncomfortable because im just not that kind of person, i like a slight chaos.

9836,EDAnonymous,"Hey everyone,

I want to tell you about MY success story for those of you feeling stuck.  
I struggled with eating disorders + disordered eating for 17 years.  That's more than half my life.  From age 11 when I was diagnosed with anorexia, through my teen years when I battled with diabetes and my eating and into my adulthood where binging and restricting took over my life.  It was an endless cycle.  


I had it bad.  I was constantly at war with my body.  I HATED everything I saw in the mirror.  
I tried to make meal plans, I researched programs the best diets  
I wrote everything out, I tried to keep the binge foods out of the house  
I was OBSESSED with food: what I ate, when I was going to eat next, how much I would get to eat, what I was craving, what I wanted but couldn't have  


It would get to the point where I couldn't take it any more.  The cookies were all I could think about.  They were calling my name.  I couldn't help it.  After having one - the floodgates were open and I would binge on anything I could find.  
Rinse and repeat  
For years  


I thought there was no hope. That I was just going to live this life forever.  Because I'd tried EVERYTHING I could think of to stop it.   


I was REALLY lucky that someone came to me with something different.  A new way to look at my body, myself, and my food that I'd never even thought of before.  


I am really lucky to, after 3 years, call myself fully recovered.  
I am lucky to be able to eat without guilt  
To be able to understand and listen to my hunger and fullness cues  
To enjoy foods that were once forbidden or trigger foods  
To exercise for pleasure and be able to take a day (or three) off  
To be able to enjoy travelling without worrying about food or how I look  
To focus on my hobbies or what makes me happy, and not think about food all day  
To be okay with eating a little more  
To having binging and food obsession be a thing of the past

1) I'm getting report on my patient and me and the other nurse open the patient's chart in epic *(I usually don't open the chart when another nurse is giving me report - very rude, nurses here: don't do it),* and usually there's a pic of the patient in the corner. I look at that pic and it's just her face but my ED radar is going off. The nurse tells me ""etc etc, distant history of anorexia, but she's much fluffier now"". I stopped myself from saying ""oh yeah I know lol"". And *fluffy,* ugh, what a gross word, just don't say anything or say that she gained weight. Fluffy is such a weird ass word. 

2) This girl my age who is a nursing assistant, who is on day shift (which means I don't see her much) runs into me in the locker room at the end of my shift and feels SO COMPELLED to tell me that I look like one of the female drug overdose patients, and I hesitate ""What do you mean?"", she says because I am a similar weight and ""my hair"". No one in ICU has nice hair, we are rolling you around in the bed and it's getting tangled. If you don't know someone, maybe DONT tell them that they look like a drugged out patient, or any patient for that matter. Also, I had 2 french braids: you're an idiot. All our patients are in the worst moments of their life, what THE FUCK is wrong with you. I'mma tell her she looks like the obese patient in room whatever next time, and I'll let her know what a shit nursing assistant is, because she is. 

Turned into a vent, but yeah, if you can be a bitch to me because I'm sick in one way, why can't do the same to you because you're overweight? 

I feel ugly and I feel the only way to control my appearance is my body, so that really sucked that I got a nasty comment about my body. I can't win, and I'm very sad and hurt.

10127,EDAnonymous,"Why do I binge and purge? It started forever ago. As early as pre-school I have very faint memories of insecurity. In elementary school is when I really grew conscious of them. I have a memory of being in school when I was ""sucking in"" my stomach. Idk where I learned this, but it wasn't a new technique. In class I remember a friend told me that she could tell I was holding my stomach in and that it ""didn't count as being skinny."" In middle school things escalated. I wouldn't eat more than a bag of chips at lunch, but I would go home and binge. I gained weight during this time and I hated myself/the way I looked. Looking back on pictures, I was chubby, and I knew it was because of my eating habits BUT I was 11-13 years old. By the time I was in high school I was serious about a sport. I wanted to be on varsity and possibly even recruit for college. This meant I needed to be fit, though this desire of mine didn't change my eating habits. They were actually exactly the same, only my physical activity level increased. My body changed a bit as I had more muscle tone, but I did not lose any weight. In retrospect this was great, but every time I looked in the mirror I felt extremely unsatisfied and ashamed of myself. I've always wanted to be thinner. With my poor eating habits came severe depressions (for a multitude of reasons that I won't get into right now). Food was (and continues to be) my comfort. During the school day I wouldn't let myself eat, but once I got home (and locked myself in my room) I ate as much as I wanted. I had been doing this for so long it became habit. There was always a voice in the back of my head assuring me that I would change, I would overcome this. I wanted to be better, but this was also around the time covid hit. I spent a lot of time alone and I wanted to change myself, but I was willing to do anything, even if it wasn't healthy. This is generally around the time I started to smoke more weed (like every night) and got addicted to nicotine. There was no need to be ready for school in the morning, my sports season was over, and the only obligation I had was showing up to a couple zoom meetings. At the time I LOVED this. No more seeing the majority of my classmates that made me feel inferior or insecure everyday of my life. I didn't immediately get worse (in regards to eating), but I eventually started to restrict more. It got to point where I'd only eat a small ""meal"" at night. By my senior year I was dropping weight. I was gaining confidence and getting more compliments. That said, obviously the amount I was eating was not sustainable and I was hungry all the time. Around the time I graduated I stated to make myself throw up. I think I could've been triggered by the stress I felt about leaving for college in the fall, but it also could've just been the gradual escalation years and years of binging and restriction. At first I avoided purging as much as possible. It felt awful. Unfortunately, however, I became custom to it. I'd become so hungry I'd binge to the point of being in pain. Purging made this pain go away and I'd feel relief. I was ashamed, but I've been keeping it up for so long that its so habitual for me (dangerously habitual). I'm now a sophomore in college and it's gotten to a point where often times several times a day that I do this. I confessed to my dad last year and he thinks I've stopped. I do stop for periods of time, but I seem always find myself falling back into it, which makes me feel weak. This cycle has distanced me from friends and family, not to mention I know how detrimental it is for my health too. Im exhausted and I need to stop, but it's almost like I have no self control when it comes to this. There are several aspects of my life that have become so difficult because of this. I know if I want to fix them it starts here with developing healthy eating habits. I've been to therapy, (for several years at a time with difficult therapists) and while with some things it has really helped, for whatever reason I'm so stuck when it comes to this.  I truly want to be better, but I don't really know how to get past this.

So my Dad had brought home a whole bunch of Panera Bread Cinnamon Rolls from a job he did at one of their restaurants (he fixes busted pipes and back flows for sprinkler heads and what not). 

I was so excited for one cause Cinnamon Rolls are one of the very few treats I allow myself cause I don't just randomly go buy any from the store so I don't eat them but once in a blue moon. And if you know Panera Bread, you know these baby's are packing icing and the sweetness. 

Anyway. I was excited. Planned to allow myself this treat. Was considering not even purging after I was in such a good mood. I had a plan. Poked holes in the Roll and poured some milk on top to let it soften the dough (feeling like a real contestant on Worst Cooks In America („ÄÄÔºæœâÔºæ) ) JUST in case I did end up falling victim to the guilt. I let it sit for a good 15 min. Took a forkfull and realized the milk had gone bad. The sweetness was completely over powered by the soured milk and I never felt so much heartbreak.

10777,EDAnonymous,"saw my ex (together 4 years,witnessed several relapses) after 7 months of not seeing each other this week (we haven't been together in years, no beef, just pals) he congratulated me on looking so healthy!! (I'm very underweight rn lol) and he genuinely meant it, it wasn't meant to be an underhand insult. 

the thing that is strange is I have weighed more than I currently do whilst I was with him and he used to be 'so worried' about how underweight/unhealthy I was.

because back when we were together he saw all my habits, what I ate etc, and he then understood the context. and that's really the only thing that people can then perceive as unhealthy.

my friends who see me regularly are like omg Ur SICK GET HELP!  But the people who have seen me irregularly, where the weight loss would have been arguably more dramatic (went from healthy BMI to a quite underweight BMI in exactly 7 months) but don't really /know/ me anymore are like seems like Ur doing rly well :)

it's just WEIRD. I'm glad people aren't worried about me (guilt complex teehee) but also kinda shocked that we are so numbed to UW bodies. of all people I'd expect my ex to have been like wtf r u doing again !!! 

idk I find it kind of reassuring in the sense that often my ED is validated by these comments of concern (even tho I hate it) - people are just rly unaware. they only think you're sick if you show them outside of what your body looks like.

10862,EDAnonymous,"So, first post here.

I struggle both with Binge Eating Disorder and Night-Eating Syndrome, which means that my struggles don't end when I go to bed. A lot of times I get up half-asleep and eat stuff I regret in the mornings. I often get so frustrated with myself with that, that I don't eat in the mornings to overcompensate. I also overeat at dinner after that.

The last three days, I've exactly done that. The thing is though, my morning Prozac requires food-- otherwise I get bad heartburn. Today, I got sick of the cycle and just went ahead and ate breakfast so I could take the damn Prozac because I've noticed my depression getting worse. Doesn't help that I JUST switched back to it after a trial run of a less useful med, so it's gotta get back in my system again first.

I do know how dumb the whole ‚Äúskip breakfast, then crave more and eat even more at night‚Äù thing is. Hope springs eternal in my dumbass disordered brain, though, I guess. But yeah, trying something new today for once. I can't take this depression anymore, no matter the calories I'd been otherwise saving.

Except that now, I can finally eat real meals. I can eat without guilt. Food isn't all I think about. Life brings me joy. Fashion brings me joy, instead of being a source of anxiety. My bigger body is a reflection of a healthier mind and a healthier body. Even if my BMI isn't what you'd expect, my doctors all day I'm doing good.

I have fibromyalgia. When I was anorexic, I was pretty much bed-bound because everything hurt and I was so weak. Now my pains are almost gone, my medication doses are getting lower and lower. I walk again. I can go to the gym to build muscle in my legs and fight the fibro.

I'm happier than I've ever been in my entire life, and people find me beautiful because I radiate happiness. They don't call me ""courageous"", or ""statuesque"" or whatever, they call me ""cute"", ""pretty"", ""beautiful"", ""ray of sunshine"". And it doesn't have much to do with my body.

18037,AnorexiaRecovery,"I first became eating disordered at 12/13. There's no need to list all the ways in which it was bad but it was a rough time in my life. 16-22 was a lot of ups and downs. I was always chasing the the lowest weight I had reached at 13. I fluctuated in weight but the obsessive thoughts remained the same. I had a really big obsession with eating ""clean"". When I saw positive things about recovery I was appalled. 

I never wanted to think gaining weight was okay. I thought I would ""lose the game"" if i recovered. I started to feel exhausted. I realized I just wanted to move on. I realized my deep depression and mood swings were very likely a byproduct of malnutrition and addiction. Maybe this wasn't my personality. Maybe things could be different. I worked on becoming sober, quitting cigarettes, and being okay with change. 

At first I started eating more, and forcing myself to eat ""unclean"" food. The stomach pain and bloating was torture. I still over compensated with exercise. I would make improvements, and then stall, and then make improvements. Sometimes I'd stress out and jump to a calculator and obsess over numbers. 

I started to think, fine I'll recover but I still need my body to look a certain way. This need has slipped away. I learned to be patient. I have much better control of my emotions. I don't look at life the way I used to. I can also remember things a lot better now.

I looked back on some photos. I look so different than I how I thought I did at the time. It blows my mind. I didn't know I had dysmorphia. I was too busy blaming myself for a million things.

18593,AnorexiaRecovery,"TW: mentions of diets, eating behaviours, swearing.

So I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn‚Äôt even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don‚Äôt know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don‚Äôt think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in ‚Äúsafer‚Äù and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: ‚Äúyeah well most people don‚Äôt know how to respond to eating disorders‚Äù / ‚Äúthey were just trying to help‚Äù and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn‚Äôt even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification. 

I often read on the internet that ‚Äòdiet culture is everywhere‚Äô and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn‚Äôt even ‚ÄúEAT THAT MUCH‚Äù is NOT the right answer either. 

Society and media have made it ‚Äònormal‚Äô and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one‚Äôs food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one‚Äôs self to look like someone they are not. 

Well, I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I‚Äôll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‚ÄòINTERMITTENT FASTING‚Äô (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL. 

You wanna know what‚Äôs normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‚ÄòHEALTHY‚Äô. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively. 

Your body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.

And for all those people who thought they were helping but were just reflecting back my insecurities and diet culture: FUCK YOU. Fuck you. Fuck you.

18993,AnorexiaRecovery,"for the longest time I thought body dysmorphia was my problem. I denied being anorexic and couldn‚Äôt see how sick I was. 

I have been in recovery for about four months and now that my ED is gone, so is my body dysmorphia... it‚Äôs crazy. 

I never knew that being so deprived and having a malnourished brain was what fueled the body dysmorphia. 

My therapist described it to me like this: ‚Äúyour brain physically could not have accurate perception when it wasn‚Äôt receiving any energy/nutrients‚Äù , aka the sicker you get to more skewed your idea of yourself becomes. People tell you you‚Äôre not seeing right because you literally cannot actually gauge reality when you‚Äôre barely surviving. 

For anyone who feels bad about their body while recovering and doesn‚Äôt like what they see, PLEASE give it time and hate it for a little more. I don‚Äôt believe in saying to just accept and love your body when you don‚Äôt yet. It‚Äôs okay to not like it right now.

The thing is, your poor body image isn‚Äôt legit. It‚Äôs a sign your brain isn‚Äôt working right yet. All of your organs are doing better, but the brain is the last thing to heal. If you need a sign that you need to keep going, it‚Äôs that you don‚Äôt feel good yet, because you WILL. 

I thought I was different and I thought that everyone else would get to like themselves eventually, but not me because I wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúas small‚Äù or look the same. 

Weirdest part? I look back on those pictures of myself and I‚Äôm horrified... disturbed and sad for that girl whose eyes had nothing behind them. It‚Äôs eerie to see now... I was a walking corpse that still didn‚Äôt believe there was anything wrong. 

Even through recovery, I felt the same way. I felt like I was just giant, that maybe I made a mistake. 

Now, with the same weight I was when I stabilized and felt so awful, I look better than I ever have and I LOVE MYSELF. Nothing has changed besides for my brain being able to see myself accurately for the first time since I was 12. 

What I‚Äôm trying to say is you all look so much more beautiful than you realize, but you can‚Äôt see it yet. But please hold on and keep going because the day you do, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre meeting yourself for the first time. Everything seems brighter, smells are sweeter, and every breath is a gift. I feel reborn as cheesy as it sounds. 

Consistency is key. Every day, stick to the routine and feel gross. Feel bad and feel scared. 

But know that one day you‚Äôre going to wake up and suddenly see yourself clearly. Your weight won‚Äôt change, your literal perception will. It‚Äôs kind of indescribable... I feel like for the first time in 8 years I know what I look like and I‚Äôm in love with my life. It‚Äôs amazing. 

I feel free as a bird. Truly free for the first time in almost half my life. :) 

You WILL FEEL THE SAME WAY. No matter what your ED is telling you. Mine tried to desperately convince me that I would be one of the few to recover and it wouldn‚Äôt work, I wouldn‚Äôt like the end result and I was going to feel gross for forever. 

I literally can‚Äôt say it enough: I LOVE MYSELF for the first time because I actually have the mental ability to now. And it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúaccepting‚Äù your new body, I genuinely like it. You will too. Just know that you don‚Äôt right now because you‚Äôre not actually seeing it yet... but when you do, you‚Äôre going to be forever grateful, wishing you did this sooner.

Since the semester started a couple weeks ago I‚Äôve relapsed pretty badly which has been a little difficult to deal with. I‚Äôm also a TA for a class where I sometimes have to share my screen on a Zoom call to teach a lesson. Last week, I was looking at this subreddit before class and forgot to close the tab before sharing the screen, so the entire class saw what I was looking at. It was very embarrassing. That‚Äôs not to say that this is something to be ashamed of, but having a ton of your peers/students simultaneously see something very personal isn‚Äôt ideal. Some of my friends are in the class and one of them brought it up to me a couple days later and I was mortified. I know that they were trying to be supportive but I hoped it would just be water under the bridge.

19459,AnorexiaRecovery,"Ok so I'm just here to share experience and just kinda be the light on the other side. 

For a bit of context I suffered from anorexia from the age of 12. I'm now 20. I didn't receive help or begin recovery until I was 17. 
At the time I hated it. It was the most emotionally draining and hardest thing I'll probably ever have to do. Recovery is HARD. But it is the best thing I have ever done. 
It's all worth it. 

Especially within the last 6 months have I really seen a difference in myself. I'm not weighing myself, I'm judging my health based on how my body feels. And I'm feeling amazing. 
I'm nowhere near where I want to be, but I'm getting there and every week I'm seeing improvement. 

The crazy thing... Every month I look like a new person. I feel like I missed out on puberty as I suffered from such a young age. I stopped growing. I didn't get curves, didn't get boobs, I stayed looking like a child. 

As I'm starting to gain weight. And I love it. I'm looking sexier, I'm looking more mature and just all round healthy. 

I'm finally starting to love myself, I'm so proud of myself. 

I take a picture of myself every few weeks. Each time I look like I've aged a year. (My face). It blows my mind. Right now I look about 17. So hopefully in 3 months time I'll look my age... Haha!! 

Guys, you can get through this. It's worth it trust me. Stay strong!",,I'm a different person,18,,recovery story,,,,t5_o3plh,lf1por,1,Goldenlunar,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/lf1por/im_a_different_person/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/lf1por/im_a_different_person/,1612750679,264,1,0,0
19509,AnorexiaRecovery,"tl;dr it's a rollercoaster, but I thought if someone could use some insight, I should post maybe?

I started recovery around 6 months ago, but relapsed after 3 weeks, and then came back to it in late October. What made me come back to recovery, was when my best friends sat down with me, and told me they didn't think they could sit down and watch me die anymore, and that it was becoming too much for them. So on the day they told me that, I started actual recovery.

I had extreme hunger for a few weeks, and still sometimes now. I didn't run nor exercise beforehand, and so after a month, my aunt offered me to go to the gym with her. I also started craving a bunch of meats, so I naturally ate a bunch of protein out of nowhere. I started gaining muscle, and I can see I have gained so much muscle back, and yes, I also gained weight along with all this. The weight gain came super fast sometimes, and then would slow down, then go back to fast, then slow down. It's still kind of like that, but now it's up and down, but I honestly don't even weigh myself as often anymore, because it's starting to become irrelevant (VERY SLOWLY). My extreme hunger varies, I still have it on certain days of the week, and certain days it's ALMOST normal, until it hits a certain time sometimes. I will say, to people worried about huge amounts of weight gain very fast, I gained super fast within a week, and I had a massive anxiety attack, almost relapsed. In my experience, that weight isn't real weight, and it's just your body processing it.

Honestly, I have had really tough moments, but I feel so much better and stronger now. I thought going to the gym would make me relapse, or restrict, but I ate even more because I felt more hungry, and I didn't feel bad. I don't feel lightheaded anymore, I can eat out, and I can be happy with my friends again, without feeling like they're worried about me. My advice, is be patient, and don't let yourself scare the living hell out of your recovery. I still have a long way to go, but I thought I would share my experience so far.

19579,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi all! I'm a few months intro recovery and wanted to share a little story on how I made the hard path a bit easier.

When I started recovering, I craved the control I felt I was losing. My partner and I thought of a system that gave me a little bit of control back: we designed a week planner, and when I followed my meal plan, I got to choose a sticker and put it on the planner for that day.

Did I feel like a six year old? Maybe. But did I want to make every week perfect by putting that sticker on that piece of paper seven days a week? Defenitely.

It also gave my partner an easy, non triggering way to support me. She could ask questions like ""are you going to earn your sticker today?"" when she noticed I hadn't eaten in a while.

It is also a tiny celebration every evening at sticker time.

Stay strong all of you &lt;3",,The sticker system,60,,recovery story,,,,t5_o3plh,l2tvx0,1,KelpieKamikaze,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/l2tvx0/the_sticker_system/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/l2tvx0/the_sticker_system/,1611340451,166,1,0,0
19655,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi there. I believe in you, okay? It‚Äôs hard. Really hard. But you‚Äôll get through it. Someone told me that recovery feels like each meal after the next. It gets repetitive, it gets boring, it gets painful, but ultimately... it gets better. 

What has helped me the absolute most is to find things that comfort me whether it‚Äôs after meals, at random times, when I‚Äôm happy or when I‚Äôm sad. These are things like baths, showers, heating pads, a warm comfy bed and snuggling with stuffed animals. 

Some of the other things I like to do are read, learn something new (I love psychology/neuroscience/science), or draw. 

I‚Äôm telling you this list of things to let you know comfort for you can be absolutely anything. And honestly, there are quite a few times that I‚Äôve found comfort in food even though there are times where I struggle as well. However, it is time for you to experiment. Find what brings you comfort. 

Another thing that has helped me is creating a positive attachment to food. I fucking love peanut butter. I will eat that shit TO THE DAY I DIE. I could probably have it at every meal for a month and still want it (ok well maybe i‚Äôd have to have some variance of nut butters) BUT STILL. I love it. And honestly, like if i‚Äôm craving a huge ass pita slathered with peanut butter and bananas I EAT THAT SHIT bc it makes me happy. In any way possible, I try to make eating fun and enjoyable. For example, I tried cooking.. for like the first time today. I made chicken alfredo. ME BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE BOTCH UR GONNA GET DIABETES but it‚Äôs delicious as fuck so who gives a shit. 

Okay that was a pretty big tangent but all and all, recovery is fucking hard. Physically, emotionally, mentally. And if you add in some little comfort activities sprinkled in your day, it makes things a bit better. 

You may feel lost, alone, depressed, obsessed and thousands of other things. But you aren‚Äôt alone. Personally, not eating enough triggered a major depressive episode for me and I can guarantee you although life sucks and I feel like a piece of shit sometimes I am a WHOLE lot happier after eating a shit ton of food and gaining weight. (and reaching out for help) My body needs the calories to process the stress of life so I can be happy, and so does yours. If your body does not have enough energy it stops a lot of processes such as your digestion, your heart, your growth, and YOUR MIND. If your body doesn‚Äôt have enough energy to process food, how is it going to have enough energy to be happy, to laugh, to create, and to thrive. 

To choose recovery is to choose to be your very best self. And that is in getting through your meal, and the next one. And the one after that. I know it sucks but choose recovery in being kind to yourself, and the greatest thing you can do for your body is nourish it.

20069,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hello Everyone,

My name is Angie Dahnous and I am the Executive Producer and Cinematographer of the film *Gaining Together.* *Gaining Together* is a documentary film about two girls Zeina and Tegan from two different worlds who met in hospital treatment center for anorexia nervosa treatment and they are sharing their journey of recovery from anorexia nervosa.

How did this documentary came to be: Over the summer during COVID-19 my cousin (Zeina) messaged me on my website about an idea for a film that she had with her best friend Tegan. I was intrigued by the idea and we had a meeting about the film via zoom, and the film took off from there.

Whats Unique about this film: What's unique about this film not only do we address anorexia nervosa for the disease it truly and the misconceptions of the disease that are always heard. Not only do the girls talk about their experience, but experts also talk about the truth and the cold hard facts about the disease.

Whats the goal of the documentary: The goal of the documentary is to educate people on anorexia nervosa who have no knowledge on the severity of the disease and leave a big impact. When the film is completed its film festival run, we want to donate the film to hospitals to educate patients and doctors alike on anorexia nervosa.

Why are we raising money: We are paying our wonderful post production crew for their hard work on the film and raising money for film festival distribution.

The film campaign is not doing so well on Indiegogo and we haven't raised half of our goal. Here is the link to our campaign on Indiegogo. [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gaining-together--2#/](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gaining-together--2#/)

20101,AnorexiaRecovery,"This time last year I was enveloped in an ED. I was working, but not mentally present. All I had energy for was laying in bed on my phone. I cut myself off my loved ones. I gave up my hobbies. I quit university. Of course there were the physical health issues too. Eventually I became so depressed that the only reason I had for not killing myself was because I wasn't skinny enough yet. 

Following an inpatient stay, a hospital stay, some gained trauma, some panic attacks, health issues, suicidal ideations, a handful of complete nervous breakdowns, gallons of chocolate flavored liquefied ass (If any of y'all have been IP, you know what I mean), months of depression and anxiety, a relapse, some more months of depression and anxiety...

I stand (or type heh) before you as someone who beat anorexia. I'm now in university again, working, learning a new language, doing yoga, and gradually learning to love myself. And I sincerely enjoy eating again. Yeah, I'm still learning the ropes around intuitive eating, and yeah, there is still that fear in the back of my head that I'll gain weight if I eat normally, but I know how to combat that now, and that fear gets quieter every day.

My biggest fear is that my mental illnesses will return. But the good news is that even if they do, I feel so much more capable of handling them. I look back on where I was last year and think, ""Wow, I really am one tenacious motherfucker.""

I'm not trying to flaunt my successes. I just wanted to let you know that it does get better and recovery is 100% possible for you. Life goes on, and it is so much more beautiful without an ED in it. I am a living example of that. I thought I'd include some tips that got me to where I am today too, hopefully they'll help someone. 

1) Laugh through the pain.

Humor is a great coping skill. There's humor even in the horrible stuff, and trust me, finding the humor in the tough stuff will make it easier to handle by taking away some of its power in your head. Example: If you don't know this already: you get hella constipated in recovery. Like, HELLA. Your body has no idea what to do with food cuz it's a chump and forgot. In treatment, if you don't shit within a few days they give you mag citrate. And if that doesn't work, an enema. And then you wait. There are two brown liquids in recovery. One is gross, chocolate, high-calorie protein drinks. You can guess what the other is. There were a lot of times everyone would be at dinner or chilling and someone would suddenly be like ""I GOTTA GO OH FUCK"" and book their ass over to the bathroom. On the one hand, super embarrassing. On the other, it was hilarious because pretty much everyone went through it. Shit was common talk among my recovery friends. Moral of the story: There is humor in almost everything, friends. Lean into it to cope.

2) Rely on your support system.

One of the stupidest parts about eating disorders is how unavailable treatment is for a lot of people. Treatment is expensive, and your insurance won't always cover it--if you can even afford insurance at all. I was incredibly lucky to be able to get so much help. But if you can't, you're gonna need people. I had to build up my relationships with my loved ones when I decided to recover. And I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have them. It can be hard for people to understand the hell that is an eating disorder, but if they're good friends or family members then they'll try to understand. If you truly feel like you don't have anyone in your life you can rely on, then step one is to start seeking out those relationships however you can. Step two is get on the Internet while you're crafting those relationships. Reddit is full of understanding humans who have great advice and can offer support. Be open to letting people help.

3) If all you can do is exist for a while, that's okay.

Not gonna lie, it really was all I could do to exist for a hot minute there. Every day was anixety-inducing and overwhelming and depressing. So I stopped trying so hard and did the bare minimum until I had a little more energy to do just a little more, and I built up from there. Yeah, it's important to push yourself, but when you're trying to recover from an eating disorder or depression, it's okay to just focus on eating, sleeping, and shitting for a while. Not forever, but for a while. You don't have to do it all today.

4) Accept that you're a tenacious motherfucker whether you like it or not.

Detemined! Persistent! Never gives up! Refuses to be destroyed! All of the above mean tenacious. And wow, are humans tenacious. We're incredibly adaptable, living in almost every type of environment throughout history. If you embrace this part of your literal DNA, you'll start realizing you can adapt to more than you think. Including the life you want that no longer features an ED.

5) Delete your public social media.

Stop messing around. There is so much freaking research about how social media has a negative effect on mental health. Bruh. It ain't worth it. For me personally, I have an anonymous IG that I use *only* to follow positive self-help accounts and to communicate with my bff because she doesn't have a cell phone right now. Maybe one day I'll start using it again, but sure as hell not when my pain around comparison and shame is so fresh. If you're seriously trying to recover, social media is only going to make it harder. (Side note: Reddit doesn't count in my book, because almost all of it is anonymous.) 

6) Swear a lot.

It's so fucking cathartic, man. Swear at diet culture. (Kiss my ass, Chloe Ting Challenges."" (Mind you, not Chloe Ting herself, she seems like a wonderful person. But her videos aren't for you, bruh.)) Cuss out the plate before you. (""You think you're tough, bitch? You're nothing but a dick-sucking ham sandwich."") Cuss at your therapist even. (""The fuck? Why would I ever even consider family therapy?"") You are entitled to be angry about your situation. ED recovery sucks, and you didn't ask for this. Swearing releases the tension, at least for me. And it makes me laugh lol.

7) Don't pretend 'it never happened.'

This is for later on in recovery, but something I tried doing after I was more confident in my abilities was being like, ""Eating disorder? What's an eating disorder? Never heard of her"" for a while. It didn't work. You can't erase trauma. If you pretend it didn't happen, all you are doing is setting yourself up for more triggering situations. Be openminded to the fact that you've been through a very hard thing, and though it isn't part of your narrative now, it *was* undeniably a chapter in your life. You and I both have to make peace with that.

8) Maybe there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe *you're* the light. 

This isn't really a tip, but it's a comment I saw somewhere (I don't recall the username, otherwise I'd give them credit) that really slapped me once across the cheek then again on the other. Full disclosure: I don't fully respect myself. I don't fully love myself. (But I don't HATE myself anymore. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm like, ""damn who is she"" and other times, even in the same day, I'll be like, ""who is that nasty-ass upright ape."" I digress.) You are the light. No one is going to save you but yourself. Even if you can't see it right now, you're glowing, bitch.

9) Realize nothing is permanent. 

It's the tacky quote hanging above your aunt's toilet. And I love it. If I've learned anything through my *cough* several mental-illness-related breakdowns, it's that emotions don't last forever. And more than that, life itself doesn't last forever. I know this isn't a thought that's comforting when you're in the beginning of recovery, but later on you'll be like, ""Why the hell would I diET and never let myself eat sushi when I have less than 100 years to live and I freaking love sushi? I'll take the goddamn rainbow roll, sir."" But if you're still in the thick of it, just keep reminding yourself that you're a tenacious motherfucker who lives in a world where things like cats and airplanes and Avatar: The Last Airbender and young Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic exist, and one day those things might be more important to you than an ED if you keep going.

Just some things that have helped me. Thanks for reading. Today I am deleting this sub from my favorited list, because I find I no longer need to come here. Thank you for all of the help, advice, support, answers, and compassion I've found in this little sub.

20174,AnorexiaRecovery,"I think some people are just need to be a higher weight than others to be healthy. No I dont meant it's bc they have more muscle, they have larger bones, bla bla. I meant they literally need to be fatter, they literally need to be a higher bf%, to be healthy. I dont care anymore if some 15 year old named suzie think that's fat logic.   
 

A little backstory- in puberty, i was always the teen version of a lower but healthy bmi (teenagers dont use bmi, they use percentile, but you get what i mean). I was always in the ""acceptable"" range at school physicals. I never tripped any alarms. I was as skinny as most other students. But I was the one who, in order to maintain that weight, was passing out twice a month, not them. I was the one having a snack as my lunch, skipping my periods here and there, failing to grow in height or chest size. Not them.   
 

It doesn't help that my sister in her teenage years could be literally off-the-charts underweight and still show no signs of disordered eating, still have a fully functional life, never pass out, no medical issues, always getting her period, etc. My mom loved talking about how she was a similar weight as a teenager, and spoke of my sister taking after her like a point of pride.   
 

I felt like even more of a failure bc I have very tiny bones and almost no muscle so I never felt like I could blame bone or muscle for my failure to be naturally skinny.   
 

Anyway, very unsurprisingly, I eventually lapsed into a full-blown ED. When I hit my LW, I started mysteriously gaining on very few cals a day. I had triggered FHA. Even my endo noted that it was an uncommon condition. I once again compared myself- why could so many people be so much skinnier without triggering FHA? I actually lost weight very slowly and relatively little of it, so why me?   
 

I started weight restoration. I was partially weight restored when I stopped that in its tracks. I had reached a bmi that most young people here have. But it just wasn't meant to be. I still needed to constantly use ED behaviours to maintain that weight. I was still mentally a wreck and obsessed with food. I felt like a crazy person stuck in a normal person's body, which felt more confusing than a crazy person stuck in an anorexic body.   
 

Yesterday, I had a realization- if I needed to constantly pass out and stunt my own growth to be normal-slim as a teenager, maybe it just isnt meant to be.   
 

It helps me to think of being naturally skinny like being naturally good at basketball. Some people are just not meant for it. It makes no sense for a 5 foot tall person to aim for the NBA and be constantly envious of natural talents.   
 

Today I stopped all ED habits. I just ate intuitively. I know I will gain weight but I'm reminding myself of the basketball analogy. I feel bad when I see so many naturally skinny people on the streets and know I can't be one of them, but I remind myself that I am good at other things. Because today, I could finally focus on pursuits I was always good at without struggling to put my food obsession in the backdrop. There are more meaningful things to have a knack for than being skinny anyway.",,"Screw it, I don't care if it's fat logic, I think some people are just not ""naturally skinny"" and not meant to maintain the minimum healthy bmi and I'm one of them",61,,recovery story,,,,t5_o3plh,iostjw,1,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/iostjw/screw_it_i_dont_care_if_its_fat_logic_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/iostjw/screw_it_i_dont_care_if_its_fat_logic_i_think/,1599568872,589,1,0,0
20279,AnorexiaRecovery,"I‚Äôm not nowhere near fully recovered, so this might not be the complete accurate way of dealing with the judgement, or fear of it. 

I wanted to say, the main reason I never wanted to gain, even though people would always tell me ‚Äúyou looked so good when you weighed more‚Äù. I always thought my friends wouldn‚Äôt like me as much if I wasn‚Äôt this skinny fragile person. Of course it‚Äôs your eating disorder saying this to you, convincing you the whole world revolves around liking you for being this way, or might be something similar. 

I know everyone always says to just ‚Äúignore the thoughts‚Äù. It‚Äôs not easy, it‚Äôs a constant war waging in your head, all the time. I never have liked my body, never. Even at my thinnest, even at my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, or in my bigger body, I never liked it.

I really put my body through so much, just in case it made me look more attractive by being thin. 

I think in the short way, living your life for everyone else in the world besides you, isn‚Äôt the way to live life. Constantly battling with yourself over your own natural instincts isn‚Äôt a way to live life. It‚Äôs something we have to eventually come to terms with, but once you realize how much time you spent worrying about what everyone thinks, rather than just living, you‚Äôll have so many emotions.

20398,AnorexiaRecovery,"I have been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia for years now. I‚Äôm 22 and the intrusive thoughts started when I was 11. It has sucked so badly and I‚Äôve cried multiple times a week over the fact that I have hated my body and could never just exist as I am. It has always felt like Ana has been in the back of my head just screaming at me to stop eating. Stop eating. Stop EATING. 

A few weeks ago I hit a dark place I‚Äôve never been at before. 

TW for self harm and ED talk 

I‚Äôm not sure if you remember, but a few weeks ago I posted about how I woke up to find stretch marks on my stomach. They had appeared over night and I‚Äôve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life. 

I relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself. 

And then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me. 

I was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work. 

Ever since then, things have been turning around. I‚Äôve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it‚Äôs much easier to dismiss. I‚Äôve also been doing physical activities (hiking, long walks), but for pleasure, and not as a means of punishing myself and/or trying to lose weight. I can look at myself naked and not cry. I feel good. 

Ana is still there, but she isn‚Äôt screaming anymore. She speaks more in a whisper, faintly hoping she can catch me in a bad moment. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, not every second is perfect and she still gets to me sometimes, but she no longer occupies my every waking moment. 

I am by NO MEANS advocating for self harm or any form of self destruction as a means of achieving clarity and relief. This was an uncontrollable action that resulted from a deep place of self loathing and an inconsolable longing for an end to the pain. Please do not do this in the hopes of it changing your mindset. 

This is what happened to me. My stomach is healing now and life is looking up. I‚Äôm now dedicated to self betterment instead of oppressive destruction of my body.

I remember sucking in constantly in hopes that people would think i wasnt fat. Now im seeing the photos, i was already so skinny in a kid way!

21450,bulimia,"I‚Äôm scared. My health is rocky at the best of times, and I‚Äôve been working hard to recover from a restriction based ED for years. I felt recovered around 2 years ago, and my recovery had been jump started when the restrictions turned to vomiting in the shower which had been a line I never wanted to cross- purely personal reasons, as not only did it feel like a sign I was unwell, but I had alot of gastric issues as a child and surgeries. 

 This past year, my health rocketed downwards worse than it ever had before. I was already being ignored my medical professionals and having to use a cane, when I woke up one day suddenly with a completely collapsed lung. I was so used to being unwell and in pain I still went to work and college without going to an in person appointment, and I ended up in hospital for 2 weeks, and having to take time off work for another 2 weeks after. While this finally gave me some answers like EDS (I can imagine the acronym being confusing here, EDS being Elnors-Danlos Syndrome) and potential POTS.

One of the biggest things flagged, was over a year after recovering I was still underweight. Wether it was no appetite, no food budget, or no time to eat I was unintentionally unable to eat enough to the last months. So now I regularly-ish (every second month) see a dietitian surrounding weight gain. But I‚Äôm failing. Following having to leave my job for health, im technically homeless. I have OCD which makes it incredibly difficult to eat foods that arent my safe, or used shared kitchen spaces without waiting months upon months to get past anxieties. I‚Äôve been staying with my friend since late August and only just managed to get the confidence to use their oven for the first time- and something happened and went wrong the first time. I‚Äôm terrified again.

And this lead to me crying/panic attacking on and off for 2 hours on the floor, unable to move. My roommate/best friend of 10 years never even checked in despite me messaging explaining it all 10 minutes in. In the end, I eat a whole pizza that was just past defrosted, uncut. My brain set conditions and compulsions, that I couldn‚Äôt message anyone for help til I was done. The want to make myself vomit after repeated and repeated in my head. I wanted to eat more, just to purge it. All i could think about already full and wanting to vomit was eating chocolate first too, knowing full well I‚Äôm trying to gain and have a dietitian appointment next Monday.

I‚Äôm going to discuss this all then, but I‚Äôm so scared. I havent been in that headspace that severely in years, or at all since starting meditation in summer. I can‚Äôt go back, my health can‚Äôt handle it, I already have to take time off work at my new job all the time over my health, which would get so much worse with weight loss especially in winter.

It was easy; I never dealt with retching or bile or anything uncomfortable associated with throwing up. I‚Äôd binge ungodly amounts of food, hit the bathroom, let the food out.

If you think this could trigger you, please don‚Äôt read any further.


Here is my story (coming from a 28y/o woman in Sydney, originally from Sweden):

I have always tried not to binge eat in front of people. You all know how it feels. But this Friday night, me and a friend skipped dinner because we realised how much snacks we had gotten ourselves for the night. I thought it would be better to only have snacks instead of dinner AND snacks. But we all know that‚Äôs a bad decision to start with.

It was cocktails, chocolate, sweets, popcorn, chips, dip, cheese, crackers - literally the recipe for a big binge. And I  c o u l d n ‚Äò t  s t o p  e a t i n g. I got so full and felt so sick from all the sugar I ate. But I still kept eating. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself and I got so embarrassed for doing that in front of my friend. As soon as she left, I went in to the bathroom and thought ‚Äúshould I just throw it all up?‚Äù And so I did. And it wasn‚Äôt so bad? It even tasted okay. But at the same time, seeing myself in the mirror with tears in my eyes - not from crying but from.. you know what. Seeing my clothes with vomit on them, and smelling myself, I felt disguise. But the feeling of an empty stomach after eating all that was just the only feeling I wanted to focus on.

Since that day, it‚Äôs just been an option. A solution for every time I binge eat or even just feel anxious about the food I have eaten. Sometimes I even decide to purge before I‚Äôm about to eat something ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be eating.‚Äù

Before this night, I had a period where I was having more of an anorectic behaviour. But since that day, the urge of binge eating has just become stronger and stronger and it is something I do a few times a week. I still restrict my food a lot which I know most days leads to binge eating but I still can‚Äôt get myself to eat more so I don‚Äôt feel the same urge to binge. Why am I so scared of gaining weight when I know how I felt when I was at the bottom from my anorectic behaviour? I know that I felt too skinny at that point, so how can that still be my goal?
This is not a game anymore.

I am seeing dietitian to get better with this but if anyone got any recommendations on how to manage these problems, please reach out. I am also happy to talk to someone in my situation being in an early stage of bulimia, so please feel free to DM me. I am new to this so I don‚Äôt even know if my behaviour will be taken as ‚Äúthats nothing‚Äù or if you all have or have had similar feelings and issues. So please don‚Äôt judge and remember to be kind to each other.

23081,bulimia,"Like Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon I‚Äôve come around a certain age .Bulimia has been a part of my life since I was twelve. I‚Äôve had my anorexic moments, my binging moments and I thought for the past few years I had left it behind. But of course not. It can‚Äôt be that easy. Let‚Äôs go back a few years. 

2018. I weigh about 200kg (400lbs). I have a really terrible health, some illnesses linked to the fact that I‚Äôve nearly doubled my weight in the past five years. Some I struggle with since my teens, even my childhood. And in order to prevent me from kicking the bucket in the years to come I see a doctor who advises me to have a gastric bypass. I see a bunch of doctors, I‚Äôm cleared by my psychiatrist because I‚Äôm a good girl who has finally stopped all of her binging shenanigans so I have the surgery in 2019. It didn‚Äôt go well‚Ä¶

Well the surgery was fine, no problem with it. I was the problem. Three months after the surgery (which was finally a gastric sleeve)‚Ä¶ I. Just. Stopped. Eating. For a month. And did not took my medications. And barely even drank water for the last week. At that time I justified it by saying that I was tired, I had a gastritis that made me vomit nearly everything. But in fact I was so afraid to eat, to weigh myself, to not lose enough. 

I nearly died. Ended up in the hospital with an encephalopathy, between life and death. The cruel lack of nutriments I forced my brain into made it almost shut down, and I still live with its consequences (tremors, memory loss, damaged optic nerves to begin with). The recovery is long and hard. I left the hospital almost blind and in a wheelchair. I still have really bad eyes and can‚Äôt remember my own birthdate without thinking about it for a moment, but at least now I can walk with the help of a cane. 

December 2020. I regurgitate. A lot. I always have a good reason for it of course. My three year old sized stomach can‚Äôt handle food properly. I‚Äôm tired. Again. It‚Äôs my migraines that make me throw up. And it is just a coincidence if I take a big gulp of water before I go to the toilet. In the middle of my meal. A coincidence too, if I weigh myself ten times a day. 

August 2021. I‚Äôve lost about 130kg (260lbs) since 2018. My skin sags all around my body. I‚Äôm always cold, even in the summer sun. I‚Äôm disgusted by myself. My appearance. My fianc√© finds me hotter than ever. I try to not cry if by mistake I see myself in the mirror. I‚Äôm still losing weight, but it‚Äôs never enough. I binge and purge up to twenty plus times a day. Due to my baby stomach, my binges look like half a normal person‚Äôs meal. 

Last week I finally opened up to my psychiatrist. How I am. How I feel. How I spend my nights awake, in an endless cycle of binging and purging. How the slightest mention of my weight loss triggers me, even if it is a compliment. How I‚Äôm also triggered if no one notices it. 

Mid September I‚Äôm going to something called an addiction center, since I live bulimia as an addiction. 

I‚Äôm 38 years old and for the first time I‚Äôm really taking care of my ED. If there are other ¬´¬†old¬†¬ª bulimics here I‚Äôd like to hear your story. And to everyone, feel free to give me advice and support. I really need all the help I can get.

23335,bulimia,"Hi,

To start off, I have kept my bulimia a secret from my family and friends, so this is the only place I can talk about it. Warning: it's very long.

When I was a kid, I loved food so much. I never had my parents restrain me, and what's worse I had a terrible childhood (my father got abducted -- our house got burned down by a militia) and so food was my comfort and coping mechanism. I had a neighbour and a close friend of the same age who shared my love for food and we used to visit each other's houses to try different foods. Naturally, I gained weight and became obese. By the age of 10, I started getting bullied in school. Once my dad was located, he wasn't himself anymore. He abused me often, ridiculed me for my body shape, and I had one escape -- junk food. I didn't develop good oral habits as no one insisted on me to brush my teeth regardless of how tiring that was. I also bit my nails often and my dad kept giving me hell for that. This continued until I left the country for Canada at the age of 15 (somewhere in the middle east, just don't wanna say where). I had an extreme body dysmorphia. To make matters worse, we essentially fleed from the middle east, most of our assets are back home so we were practically poor. I went to high school here and my anxiety went through the roof. I had immense self-loathing that ate away at me for 4 years. Oddly enough, this self-loathing helped me punish myself by starvation to lose weight. Besides, we were poor, so it just worked out financially. I started losing weight ... really fast. At the age of 17, I became another person. I became extremely thin. My mom had left Canada for 5 months, and after she returned she just cried once she saw me. In a way she was happy I got over my obesity, but in another way she was very sad that I looked so starved and my face looked exhausted all the time. My secret was my work. I worked at Tim Hortons (physically exhausting) usually for 8-12 hours a day (1-2 shifts per day) 6 days a week. One time I decided to treat myself for a nice meal at a fancy restaurant since I had saved a lot of money. I overate that night. I felt full yet very very guilty. That feeling of being full was not right to me. I felt ""fat"". I felt not right. I felt disgusted at myself. That's when it hit me. I discovered my bulimia. The very first purge was painful, difficult, and messy. However after I did it, I felt relaxed, clean, and ""thin"" again. On my way back home, I thought I found the best of both worlds. Satisfying my cravings and not gaining weight. I hadn't used food to cope for a while, but my depression and loneliness was at an all time high, so opening that nostalgic door was very tempting, especially then that I had my solution: purging. Over 2 years of purging, I learned which foods to avoid as they were impossible to purge and techniques that made purging easier (i.e. drink water to clean up everything until I feel the stomach acid). I even trained my reflexes by now. I can push food up from my stomach to my mouth effortlessly. Sometimes, you can catch me suddenly chewing after eating. That would freak normal people out. Anyway, at the age of 20, I felt very desperate as I had loose skin due to fast weight loss. However, I didn't think or know it was loose skin. I thought it was fat. So I kept up the bulimia. Despite having a normal BMI, I sometimes say I'm obese and my friends give me a very strange look. I obsess over calories on menu items and they ask me why I do that. My social life has gotten much better this year at the age of 21 (the pandemic and lockdowns made me crave people and socializing, so I have been taking care of my appearance and putting myself out there). However, last week I visited a dentist (last time was in 2015). He immediately recognized the signs of my bulimia and told me I'm at a junction point. While my teeth enamel is worn down and won't recover, and I have a lot of cavities, he said all is fixable but you need to start right now. He said if I kept up with my bulimia, they'd have to extract all of my teeth at some point. I became freightened. Now I brush my teeth, floss, rinse with mouthwash at least 3 times daily. I have been staying away from acidic drinks and trying to reign in my bulimia. I am making progress. I have brought down my binge/purge cycles from 3 times a day to 0-1 times per day. The day before yesterday I didn't purge. Unfortunately I did once yesterday and today. However, I'm beginning to learn how to reign it in. The secret for me is to avoid binge-ing. There is nothing to purge if I don't binge. It's easier said than done, but I'm making progress. I have another dentist appointment on Monday. I'll have a bunch of fillings but it's very expensive. My insurance is set to expire in September and my current job does not offer coverage for student interns, so I will have to stop purging and take care of my teeth until next year I return to school and my insurance resumes. I am sharing this because I genuinely feel scared about this life transition and excited at the same time because it could mean I'll recover. 

If you are new to this, please find a way out as soon as you can because it isn't pleasant. Bulimia is very expensive. And it will cost you more than the food. The dental care, the time, the agony, ..., it's just too much. If you are in the middle of it, please think deeply about it. Ask youreself where are you headed? If you're recovering, stay strong and let's support each other. I really wish you the best. From the bottom of my lonely heart. I love you. I understand your suffering and it hurts like hell when you can't share it with your loved ones because of how ashamed you feel.

23802,BingeEatingDisorder,"This is still early, but it's so profound for me.

I had a Ketamine IV infusion done Thursday. I don't know exact doseages, but I'm just over 300 lbs.The next day I awoke and slowly notice something was different, for the first time in my life I am only eating when I am hungry. 

This experience as a metaphor: I'm eating the same way I would take Tylenol. I don't take Tylenol for emotional comfort/ fun. I take Tylenol when I have a physical pain. Well that's been my eating the past 3 days, only when my stomach grumbles.  The thought of eating when not feeling hunger has as much appeal as taking extra Tylenol for no reason. 

I am floored.  I am praying this stays. I feel free from a ball and chain I've been dragging around nearly all my life. 

I didn't go into the therapy expecting my eating disorder to be improved. I had a dozen other issues to work on. I am so excited to see my brain has this level of neuroplasticity.

23825,BingeEatingDisorder,"I am an 18 year old female student. I have been struggling with BED since approximately two years. Before, I used to be anorexic (binge/purge subtype). 
I had lost a huge amount of weight and went from 67kg to 49kg in the span of 4 months (I measure 1m66 cm). 
I restricted a lot obviously, but always had 2-3 days in the months where I would eat up to 5k calories. My stomach would hurt, I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep, and I literally felt like I was dying. 
I‚Äôve always struggled with my weight. My mom bullied me a lot about it (and it‚Äôs how I developed anorexia in the first place). I always felt insecure of being chubbier than most people my age, although not obese. Food helped me cope with an empty life, as I was a really lonely kid.
Today, I still feel the effects of my childhood. I can‚Äôt look at my face in the mirror and nor my body. Sometimes I feel ashamed to even go out. 
I am almost back of my starting weight of two years ago (I am 63kg). I know it might not seem that much but since I gained really quickly (I couldn‚Äôt stop binging) my body looks disgusting, I accumulated all my fat around my hips and it makes me feel huge. I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight but with no sucess. I literally can not stop binging. It makes me feel extremely sad. 
I attend a boarding school so losing weight is even harder since I have to eat with other people and it‚Äôs harder for me to control myself.

23840,BingeEatingDisorder,"Hi everyone,

This will be my last post for at least a week, but I wanted to share a few things in this reddit because of how hard I looked for the ""one"" solution and so desperately each day wanted to ""just get better.""

If you want the VERY moment I realised I was recovered, it was on a Christmas Day evening when my kind of boyfriend broke up with me (yes on Christmas Day) and the next morning rather than waking up and binging, I felt calm and like the last thing I wanted was food. I guess I had an ""epiphany"" that if I was binging, I needed to get to the root cause rather than numbing myself with food. I realised in that instance that having a ""kind of"" boyfriend wasn't healthy for me, and it was destroying me from the inside out.

However, I've compiled a much more general list below which doesn't involve your SO breaking up with you! :) If you read the list like a roadmap to recovery, it may help you, even if you take one thing on. Everybody's journey is different.

How did I know I reached ""real"" recovery after 15 years of trying?

1. I stopped body checking: I wasn't constantly comparing my body size to random strangers on the street. Yes it's as creepy as it sounds!
2. When I wake up in the morning, my first thought isn't about food. I found other things to be excited about and purposely booked things into my weekend such as catch ups with friends that meant I \*had\* to be social.
3. I began to focus on other hobbies that didn't centre on food e.g. learning how to watercolour and talking walks, urban sketching etc.
4. I stopped using my weight as a success marker, and started using my emotional state as a marker instead: was I feeling generally happy? Have I been getting enough sunshine? Am I more present with my child?
5. Skip this one if you're squeamish: my body just works better - I am not farting uncomfortably all day, my bowel movements are more regular, I am not constantly out of breath, and my thighs only chafe raw if I wear something too small like stockings
6. I rely on other methods to get me through tough emotions. It was ALWAYS food and ALWAYS sweet or salty. Now I will message friends, snapchat them, take a walk, get outside, or clean my house (it's therapeutic for me okay haha), try and watercolour (badly)
7. Finally figuring out that I can't rule the world from my bed. I would spend all day in bed, watching Netflix and not getting out at all. This really fuelled my depression and made it impossible for me to progress without getting up for the day.
8. I got over my intense fear of hunger. I had intentionally starved myself for years to be the smallest possible version of myself but that wasn't sustainable and I was very weak - prone to passing out and constantly cold. This made me very scared of feeling hungry. But now I know hunger signals that...I have to eat. And I always honour this hunger, so now I don't feel fear at all.
9. Realising that my 4yo son was starting to pick up on my most destructive behaviours - eating in secret by hiding under his bed and squirrelling away food for later. This broke my heart honestly. I already felt inadequate because I am a single parent, but this honestly was a dagger in my heart. Moving past these and enjoying all foods with my child has now given us both so much freedom - he doesn't hide food anymore.
10. Going to a therapist who takes none of my BS. She calls me out when I'm even considering dieting, and honestly I am kind of scared of her in a good way haha. She is very direct, which is exactly what I need!

Enjoy your week people, and remember to count every tiny step of progress as a success. Little by little you will get there.

23890,BingeEatingDisorder,"When I was in highschool, I was obese. I weighed 250 lbs. Then, over the course of many years and lots of hard work, I got down to 175 lbs. I was so proud. I had 6 pack abs and a muscular physique. I looked more youthful as a sophomore in college than I did in highschool. I felt like I could do anything. Then, I had my first binge. I wasn‚Äôt too upset by it. I still looked great. I would just get back on it and not do it again. Then I binged again. And again. 3 months later I sought out help, talked to a nutritionist. At this point I was 185 lbs. Still very fit, but the binges were getting more and more frequent and severe. I felt completely out of control. The nutritionist gave me tips, but I still couldn‚Äôt get it under control. I felt like she never really took my issue seriously, cause I still looked quite fit. But my issue only got worse. I started skipping classes because I was too ill from having binged. My grades started slipping. My nutritionist ended up moving to a different country. So I switched to a therapist. She didn‚Äôt help either. I had to leave her because she was too expensive. All the Uber Eats didn‚Äôt help. I read books, such as brain over binge. Some books helped, some did not. None stopped the binging permanently. A year passed of continuing to binge and gain weight. I started skipping the gym because I was too insecure from all the weight I gained. I used to look so fit that people would compliment me. Now I can‚Äôt even fit into my gym clothes anymore. I can‚Äôt bear to show my face there. I also lost my girlfriend. The mental issues brought about by my BED put too much strain on our relationship.

23946,BingeEatingDisorder,"Hi everyone. I have been a binge eater for as far as I can remember. I used to hide food under the bed and in cabinets and just wherever I could. I'm  not going to get into the fun of all of that but I've always been big. My mom told me out of her 6 kids I was the one to make her the biggest. I was placed on every diet possible staying with my grandmother and when I was about 18 I got into a bad relationship that pushed me over 300 pounds. After I left that relationship he stalked me and eventually I began to hear less and less from him. I still do occasionally but I just try to ignore it. 

My problem is at my highest I was 375. Once covid hit I was able to stay home and focus on school full time. I put my health first and got down to 308. I was staying with my sister and her kids and I was even able to help my niece but the problem is I was on phentermine at the time also. So I was eating once a day and working out for 2 hours daily. My body got used to the phentermine and then I became homeless. I got everything back together eventually and even got into a great relationship. But I also got back up to 339 pounds. So I went to what works for me, medication. I am on my 2nd month of ozempic and I have lost about 20 pounds but even though this medicine makes me not hungry I still binge and constantly. I rescheduled my last appointment because I still had lost no weight this month. 

This binging is ruining my relationship with my boyfriend. I am not the first plus size person he dated but in my mind I'm not good enough for him so I always think he is out cheating even though he tells me he has no problem with my body and loves me. But I really want kids and soon. I just turned 30 and I have PCOS. When I was losing weight even though it was unhealthy I was getting a cycle every month so I know it's my weight holding me back from us starting a family. 

I just don't know how to have a healthy relationship with food, I have been to therapy, tried to go to a nutritionist I was even vegetarian for about 8 years. Nothing works for long though. When I binge my depression flares up and I binge even more. I just want to know if you guys have any tips on how you are getting control of this horrible curse. Thanks for any help.",,I'm tired of the way I'm living.

24003,BingeEatingDisorder,"I never had a name for my eating habits. I only knew that they made me feel awful. Years after struggling with the way I eat food I was telling a friend this: ""whenever I feel bad, or whenever I've worked hard and I want to give myself a treat, I let myself indulge and indulge in food (to celebrate myself or to punish myself) and I eat to the point where I physically feel in pain, I get so bloated or I feel disgusted with how much I eat. But not in a binge eating kind of way."" And my friend looked at me and she said, ""but that is binge eating."" I never realised that's what I was doing all those years. It's not often, and I don't struggle with any weight issues, but I do have periods of time where (especially when my father passed away) I can't control the amount of food I eat, or I eat to the point of not enjoying the food, but simply wanting to consume it and anticipating the pain that will come after. It's like a challenge I have with myself to see how much I can force myself to eat, and it has infliltrated the general way I eat food, where I don't understand the signs that my body gives me about hunger and feeling satisfied. Even with small meals I often overeat and feel heavy and tired instead of stopping when I'm full. All this to say it's been good to finally understand what it is that I do so I can start being conscious about it and educate myself about it and do something.",,I never realised that I binge eat,1,,my story,,,,t5_33q99,10ig5po,1,pomelopeel,,/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/10ig5po/i_never_realised_that_i_binge_eat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/10ig5po/i_never_realised_that_i_binge_eat/,1674381427,277,1,0,0

24063,BingeEatingDisorder,"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. I have suffered from depression for 25 years and BED for about 7 years. In early 2016 I was at a healthy weight. I lived in a city where I didn‚Äôt know anyone, so my depression took a turn for the worse. I ate. I binged until I couldn‚Äôt walk or breathe because it was the only thing I found comfort in. I continued this unhealthy pattern almost daily until I had gained upwards of 80 lbs. I was ashamed and felt so guilty, but I didn‚Äôt care the second I placed my takeout order for that day. Eventually, I moved home where my friends and family were shocked to see the changes in me. I continued this destructive behavior all while lying to myself that I would stop. I didn‚Äôt. 

In late 2020, I decided I needed to make a change for good. I missed being social. Dating. Intimacy. Not being embarrassed every second of every day about the decisions I made and my disorder. Of course, as we know, many people don‚Äôt view BED as a legitimate eating disorder. They just see weight gain and assume all sorts of stuff. Anyway, I started reading self help books, therapy, and trying my best to ignore the urges. ‚ÄúJust one last time,‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äùyou had a hard day, you deserve it.‚Äù 

Eventually, I was successful and lost 70 lbs. I felt so good for the first time in years. Unfortunately, that was short lived because throughout the last year I have gained almost 40 lbs back. BED is seriously like having a switch to off and entering a robotic state and binging even though it‚Äôs 100% not what you want to be doing. 

I‚Äôve been trying again to recover and lose weight but I‚Äôm so overwhelmed with all of the conflicting information out there. Do this, not that. Do that, not this. It‚Äôs too much. I‚Äôve struggled with losing some weight and not binging to binging and then putting it back on again. It‚Äôs a never ending cycle. 

I‚Äôve learned not to restrict (this is a trigger for me) and I saw some dark chocolate pretzels at the grocery store that I really wanted. I bought them and last night when I was feeling particularly low I opened them. I promised myself I would only have 10. And I did not break that promise. I felt really good about allowing myself to have a treat and keeping the promise I made. I feel like even though it‚Äôs a small win, it shows that I can do this again and recover, even if it‚Äôs slowly. Anyway, thanks for reading, and hugs to everyone who knows how this feels!",,The small wins.,1,,my story,,,,t5_33q99,10g5fbs,1,Outside_Ambassador73,,/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/10g5fbs/the_small_wins/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/10g5fbs/the_small_wins/,1674144290,452,1,0,0
24089,BingeEatingDisorder,"I started Concerta for my ADHD, and taking it daily has changed my life. I can do the normal life things I need to do, but notably it is a HUGE help with my binging disorder. The medication really helps me to manage impulses surrounding binging. 

It also completely erases my appetite, but I‚Äôm making the effort to have multiple healthy meals every day so I‚Äôm not accidentally starving myself. So far it‚Äôs been one solid month and I‚Äôve lost around 10lbs! That sounds like a lot, but my starting weight was 315lbs, so this needs to happen for my health and wellness.

24124,BingeEatingDisorder,"For context, I have always had a binge eating disorder. However, during covid it hit a huge spike. I gained 40 lbs in one year. 

Growing up, I was always fat shamed even though at the time I was 120 and 5‚Äô5. As you can guess, this set me down a spiral where I would stress eat and actually become fat. 

I would always make excuses to not workout or to not binge. I was miserable. It was obvious that people had notice my weight gain and they all started treating me quickly. My senior year of high school was hell. 

First year of college, I was away from home and started to feel independent. Skip forward, I got a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with BED. It was nothing new really. However, just two weeks ago, he prescribed me vyvanse and it so far has significantly changed my life. 

Vyvanse is not a weight loss drug, but it is meant to suppress your impulses and binge like tendencies. Its been only 1.5 week and I have already loss nearly 10 pounds since the beginning of January. 

However, I have also been working out. Nothing too intense really, just walking for 30 minutes on a treadmill with an incline. Vyvanse is also prescribed for patients with ADHD, and I have never felt more productive and social in my life. I no longer care of how people think about me and because I have been keeping myself busy, I haven‚Äôt thought about food as much as I usually do. In my experience, its also kind of like an appetite suppressant but don‚Äôt quote me on that.

Vyvanse is very expensive, and I just feel so fortunate that my insurance covers it. Although the weight loss and change is minimal, I already fell so much better- like there is hope for me.

24152,BingeEatingDisorder,"Hey everyone! Long story short - I used to struggle with anorexia/restrictive eating for years when I was younger. I thought I recovered, but I think what actually happened was I was so afraid of going down the Ana ED road again, that I actually swung my pendulum in the other direction and developed BED; I‚Äôve put on just, a ridiculous amount of weight over the years and when I try to diet or get healthy, those intense fears of anorexia come flooding back and I instinctively binge to prove I‚Äôm ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù.
