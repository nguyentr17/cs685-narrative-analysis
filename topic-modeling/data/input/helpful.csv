353,353,EatingDisorders,"Hi guys, I have been wanting to compile this for a while now &amp; today felt right. 

Brief background, I was diagnosed with anorexia for 4 years, then binge-eating disorder for 1 year, and began attempting recovery in 2017 while struggling with flip-flopping to both sides of the spectrum. 7 years total of major depression and other related mental health issues prior to 2017. I am currently 20 years old. 2017: 

1. How to stop binge-eating?? First focused on awareness mid-bingeing that I wanted to stop. I realized I would go mentally numb and binge-eating was a coping mechanism for my stress. I wrote myself a letter the morning after a binge, describing every detail, telling future me why it didn't help, how awful my body felt, and that I could do better for myself. I still read this from time-to-time today. Discovered I felt like I was intrinsically-worthless, but did not yet make a connection that the false belief contributed to my binges. 

2. I always had a journal my entire life and realized I only ever journaled the negative things in my life. I made my first attempts at jotting down positive things as well. 2018: First time I went to therapy. Realized anorexia &amp; binge-eating both had to do with control. I turned to not eating to feel in control when everything else was crazy, and binged when life was too painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized several very important things that made this year a turning point: 

1. I allowed myself to be alone and feel pain alone. I previously used food to avoid facing my emotions. 

2. Food-focus was a coping mechanism. I brain-stormed on paper a list of 50+ other possible coping mechanisms for stress and picked a few that I loved: meditating, drinking sparkling water, reading, going for walks, taking hot showers, reaching out to a friend, working out. 

3. I learned it was important to give names to what I was avoiding: discovered that being sxually abused as a child was what triggered my initial disordered eating. I had refused to face it for years &amp; through professional help, finally began processing what happened to me, instead of avoiding it with food control or binges. I identified my disorder as something inside of me, not actually \~me\~. 

4. Facing a very invasive surgery (unrelated to my ed) I discovered the power of meditation with self-awareness and anxiety. The best way for me was to visualize that I was a tree &amp; my thoughts were the birds around it. I am not my thoughts. I am a being. First discovered the experience of being fully present, with short 5-minute meditations where I just allowed myself to be aware of all my thoughts, sitting cross-legged in a quiet room on the floor with my eyes closed. 

2019: Had a few relapses from challenging life events, but learned a lot. 

1. First learned how to forgive myself even if others were still hurting. 

2. Learned about boundaries in therapy. I either had stringent boundaries or very weak boundaries and almost nothing in-between. 

3. Began learning how to be more open about my issues &amp; chose people to confide in \*VERY critical to the next steps of healing in the next 2 years, although it seemed unrelated. This was the year I began to build my ""support group"". I had no one to confide in previously. 10/10 highly recommend first focus on finding 1 person you can trust with your journey. 

4. Learned about Guilt vs. Shame: my therapist recommended TED Talk ""Listening to Shame"" by Brene Brown on YouTube, it CHANGED my life. I realized I struggled with shame, not guilt, &amp; began to make distinctions between the two &amp; reframe how I felt about myself. 

2020: Huge accomplishment: Achieved my first 6 months at a healthy weight that I felt beautiful at, w/o fluctuating up &amp; down significantly! Really began developing a sense of when it's ok to eat &amp; when to stop. Had 1 more major relapse. 

1. I read the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"": just the 1st 2 chapters was enough to realize how deeply embedded our childhood is in all of us. HIGHLY recommend. Gave me further power over my deep pain &amp; ability to separate desire to eat/avoid eating with desire to not feel pain. Realized I could be in control if I wanted. 

2. Did a 30-day challenge called ""Beating Binge Eating"": learned a TON, highly recommend. For me specifically, learned I had a lot of bad habits with control. I not only controlled food, but tried to control everything else too. I attempted a more holistic approach, identified things (like my family) that I gave too much power to, &amp; began to focus more on me through ""self-care"". -Important Take-aways from this challenge: Even tho my over-eating was not as calorically large as it used to be, it was still compulsive and therefore a binge. I now label any compulsive eating as a binge, because naming it gives me power over it. I would often spend 20 minutes in Walmart picking the perfect calorie/flavor/type of ice cream &amp; realized I did this with a lot of foods, and ordering in restaurants. I gave myself a time limit to decide on food--because, after all, it's just food. Also made 2 new rules on my weekly food-shopping: (1) if I saw a food I liked 2 weeks in a row &amp; still wanted it, then I got it the 3rd time I saw it. (2) every week I bought myself at least 1 treat, no matter what. This allowed me to discover I could in fact have treats &amp; not binge on it, because I knew I would be getting more the next week no matter what, &amp; helped heal some scarcity mindset. 

3. Self-Care: Watched ""AlexandrasGirlyTalk"" Youtube video on How To Self Care. Applied it to my life: scheduled in showers, researched best soaps/makeup/ways to make myself feel good in ways other than food to decrease my stress. For the first time ever, dedicated a couple hours a week to relaxing, even if it felt selfish or like I should be doing other more ""important"" busy-work. Really learned how to connect with myself &amp; truly feel, cry, &amp; not be numb. 

. Attended EMDR therapy for my trauma&amp; began learning how to re-file everything. HIGHLY recommend therapy in general. By FAR the biggest contributor to my healing. I saw 5 total therapists in 2 years ranging from eating disorders, general therapy, and EMDR. It's OK if it takes a couple tries before you find one that you work well with. 

2021: I moved 1300 miles away from my hometown &amp; got a new clarity on what I want in life. 

1. I read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fck"": Realized I cared too much about what my family/everyone thought of me. Fully accepted it’s OK to take a break from communication with toxic people &amp; am currently still on that break to connect with what I want. I had also assumed being a certain weight added value to my life. I was wrong. 

2. I read the reddit post ""How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide For Those Who Struggle"": The phrase ""Bruh, it's just food"" stuck out to me. I’m learning to identify that the only thing a binge/over-eating does is satisfy the urge to binge. I gave it too much control/importance because of how I initially abused it as a child for a false sense of control. I will literally chant ""Bruh, it's just food"" in my head when I feel compulsive, &amp; most times I say it until my heartrate slows down, I believe it, &amp; I can simply move on with my day. Sometimes I fail (aka obsess over food for way longer than I like) &amp; that's OK too. 

3. Discovered I needed to Fail: one day I walked to the gym, stayed for 1 minute, &amp; walked back--shocked when I was in tears with sudden urges to binge &amp; couldn't get it together for a while. My whole life I told myself I can ""fail"" but never believed it &amp; always punished myself after without being aware of it. New way of thinking I am attempting now: If I don't want to do something, I will attempt it for 5 minutes and then stop if I still don't want to. Then actually allow myself to stop after 5 minutes without creating any consequences for myself. Still learning how to do this, but it’s incredibly freeing &amp; allows me to enjoy a large meal and move on with my amazing day. Or take a day off from a heavy lifting routine in the gym &amp; play videogames instead w/o beating myself up for being ""lazy"". 

4. New eating goal: I eat until my hunger signals go away, not eat until I am completely full for hours. Still learning to do this, but it leaves me free to eat enjoyable food when I want &amp; look forward to more later. 

5. Discovered I still struggled with feeling intrinsically worthless. To combat this, I began to put my worth in a higher power, Jesus. Yes this is specific to my religion, but my whole life I tried to get my worth from what I do for other people, &amp; how they perceive me. I realized this will always be lacking &amp; needed to choose something somewhat arbitrary for my mind to latch onto, something that will never change, so even if the people around me are not treating me well, I know I don’t need their validation to be allowed to live a full life. This has helped me ease desires of food coping mechanisms, &amp; instead believe I am not intrinsically dirty just by the fact that I exist &amp; am already loved by someone/something beyond us. 

I'd love to hear what others have used for combatting feelings like this too! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but this is the only thing that has truly impacted my life at its worst. Overall, I realized my eating disorders had almost nothing to do with food. It was the most convenient coping mechanism at the time, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong or dirty about me because I still obsessively think about food sometimes. There is SO much more to life than food. My journey needed a much more holistic approach than just focusing on food... so hope this helps someone else too. If you're at this point or beyond, what have you learned? How do you lose the desire to eat once you are full/move on with your day? Do you obsess sometimes still, or eventually it went away for you completely?

me, my mother (who BTW lost a lot of weight in 2018-2019) and her husband (not my dad, my mom is a single mother) are right now at a hotel. the hotel has breakfast and dinner. on thursday my family went to a restaurant, and I ate a pretty hefty meal around 5pm. then there was dinner and I was not hungry, so I ate a small dinner bc I know that if I don't eat something in the evening, I can't fall asleep (yes, it sucks). It was around xxx calories. friday morning (yesterday) I ate for breakfast a huge meal, and for dinner, It was a motherfucking feast. *meal details deleted*. I was absolutely conscious about that (although not completely under my control), and it was planned ahead (I told myself ""fuck it, I'll just eat undtil I'm stuffed because this is food that Isn't readily available at home usually"") after the meal I was stuffed as hell, and had a few mini-pukes. I told myself, while looking in the mirror and having my camera on ""I am worried for you [u/nothereforupvotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/nothereforupvotes), I don't want you to develop and eating pattern like this, of eating until you are stuffed and gaining fat. tomorrow you will eat 2 slices of bread, a small container of cottage cheese, an egg, and a lot of veggies, maybe a small savory pastry (kid of a trigger but I ate only a small one). understood?"" I didn't beat myself up as much (and when I did, I said ""this is an alarm going off, that something isn't right. I can do this without beating myself up"") which is an achievement bc I used to beat myself up after occasions like that"". "" then went outside for a little bit, wrote down my thoughts and feelings about this event and other events throughout the day, and then got into a convo with a friendly couple that also slept in the hotel. woke up at around 9am today (saturday), went to breakfast with my mom and kept that promise.was full, but not stuffed. then around 2pm there was lunch and I slightly overate (more than I planned) but not to the extent of what happened on friday It was much better. an hour ago I ate a large salad and a small bowl of mac&amp;cheese. I was proud of myself for bouncing back and not going to the other extreme like I see other people do on this sub. I am really happy for myself for not purging/starving like othe people would do, and wanted to share some tips that when I do have a successful time managing my eating.

find passions unrelated to food, or at least not eating it. music (huge one for me), hobbies, skills, shows on TV.

hard AF, but try to be compassionate with yourself. Instead as labeling yourself as a ""pig"" or a ""fatso)"" but telling yourself ""I have a problem, and it sucks. I want to have better habits and be able to control myself.

prepare your meals ahead of time, and eat low calorie dense foods that taste average to good, so they won't be extremely disgusting to the point of not being able to stick long term, but not extremely delicious so you'll be able to stop.

find an accountability partner with the same interest (for me it's my mom who tries to maintain a healthy weight and has a history with being overweight)

try and understand the root of your binges. maybe it's lack of other interests other than food, boredom, FOMO (a huge reason for me) trauma, mental health disorders, etc. I don't want to be a holier-than-thou, rather give people hope, BC this sub is at times very pessimistic.

tl;dr- went to a hotel, gorged insane amounts of food in the span of 30 hrs, but held myself accountable and bounced back with a healthy and relatively small breakfast, avoiding compensatory behavior.

I have recently found out that my daughter (13) has been avoiding eating, and purging if she does eat. Her mom and I have had a talk with her, and she seems like she wants to recover. We have already helped her find a therapist, and have her first appointment scheduled. I'm hoping to find information on how to make this as easy as possible on her. How could I cook for her? Should I push her to tell me what she wants from the grocery store, or just stock the house with food I know she likes? How can I keep up with what's going on with her without making it feel like I'm invading her privacy constantly?

711,711,eating_disorders,"Hey guys. I’ve been struggling with ED for my entire life(no joking, I remember hating myself at 6!) . It got especially bad this winter when I found out about IF and got crazy starving myself to the point I couldn’t stand up without holding on to something. After 5 months of this I started to lose my hair viciously and was overall extremely tired of restricting and not letting myself to focus on other things so I decided to recover.

It wasn’t so easy to stop controlling and I would never stop counting calories, but at least the “clock” in my head had stopped (negative sides of IF). A month ago I just had enough of calculating calories every single day so I turned off the calculator as well.

I just eat whatever feels good every day, there are no restrictions except for eating what I want(so I don’t eat cucumbers anymore to fill my stomach). Believe me, this is the life everyone should have (I still can’t get rid of the thoughts about food though).

Today I was curious how many calories I eat intuitively so I tried to count it (I wasn’t counting it throughout the day, but summarized my meals at the end of the day). It’s such a wonder for me that I actually consume less calories that I used to when I was obsessed with controlling my diet. Now I don’t count any calorie that comes in my mouth, I just enjoy it.

I just want to cheer you up a bit and show that every single fear about food is in your head. You deserve a better life! People are not often worth trusting, but your body surely is! Just let it show you what it’s like to just live.

So recently I’ve found out that my partner is recovering from an eating disorder. Sometimes he eats but sometimes he struggles to. Recently though, he’s been really trying and I’m so so proud of him! 
I really want to help him as much as I can but fear that I’m not helping enough or that I’m not doing the right things as I have no experience. 

One thing he finds nice is when I ask if he’s eaten today; to which he usually replies “yes but only something small”. 
I feel incredibly proud of him and the progress he’s made and I’m wondering what are some supportive things I can say or do when they tell me they’ve eaten? 

I tell him “I’m so proud of you” and then tell him he’s doing amazingly but I don’t want to just keep saying the same things, yknow? 
Again, I’m overthinking. 

If anyone has any advice that would be great! Thank you :)

Some background and a bit of recovery so far: 

Hi it's my first post on here I don't really know how to use reddit but I check out the ed subreddits a lot for encouragement and other people's experience with recovery. I'm 14 and it started this year in March. The things I do is restrict, over exercise, count, and have a strict routine (my doctor told me I was anorexic). I've been seeing a psychologist since September this year and she's been really helping me figure out the cause of my ed and processing all the emotions. I was at my lowest weight in August to September and I felt really sick all day and got a lot of bad symptoms (ex: hair loss, cold all the time, brittle nails, low energy, etc). It made it hard to go to school :( (I'm at a new school this year and I've made no friends so far which has been making me feel worse. I was never like this before but with my ed I'm more nervous around people and I start to shake or freeze if I try to talk to someone or even the thought of trying to talk to someone :(( any tips for that would be nice)

Since then I started increasing very slowly since I was really scared of weight gain. I was also increasing my exercise to earn my food. Since then, I have gained a little bit and I'm at a weight that's still too low but feels high to me and I don't want to gain more. Later in October, I started increasing my intake by a little every Sunday. I liked doing this at first but then I realized why I liked it. I did it because it still gave me control and I was still restricting by not going over the limit I gave myself. Anyways, with my psychologist I've been working on accepting the weight gain and that I need it to recover. 

Today was the first day that I didn't restrict, I ate at random times, and I listened to my physical and mental hunger.

1. Pls seek professional help if needed whether you are struggling of what form, it doesn't matter whether u meet the diagnosis requirements or not cause every individual is different

2. BMI is truly not an accurate indication of whether you are healthy or not. Especially in sports where muscle weigh more than fats and how everyone is just different with some having heavier bones than others? 

3. If you're lacking financially to seek help, u should at least tell a friend or talk to someone, even if it's the last thing u wanna do

4. Puberty is a stage of a lot of changes and you may gain weight but you are not fat just because you go through puberty &amp; u should not compare yourself before and after puberty 

lastly, I kinda get how trapped u feel between recovering &amp; falling deeper in &amp; I just wanna say pls don't give up and if you're ever suicidal, pls tell an adult or whoever and trust me, it'll get better and 1 or 5 years down the road you'll be grateful &amp; so freaking proud of yourself for holding on

*As men, we don't learn about eating disorders.*

* *From society, we hear that ""guys don't have eating disorders, only women do"".*
* *From our own brains, we tell ourselves ""it's not manly, it's shameful"".*
* *From our well-meaning friends, we hear ""you're fine mate, everyone eats a lot, don't make a big deal of it"".*

*Luckily, I've had CBT therapy in the last 18 months and am doing well now.*

*But I know how difficult it is for us men who binge eat.We firstly need to be aware that this exists as a condition and we then need to be able to admit to ourselves that we are struggling.Only then can we get the help we need.*

*So the stigma and the shame needs to change.*

*My mission is to make it easier for guys like me — and maybe if you're reading this, guys like you — to get the help we need to tackle binge eating.*

1263,1263,eating_disorders,"Hi all,

I see so many suffering on here and just wanted to offer up some words of encouragement.

I'm a 48 year old woman, and my eating disorder started when I was 13.  I was going through puberty and got a little chunky and was picked on.  Back in the 80's overweight wasn't common, and I was a bookworm who loved to eat chips and snacks all day!  My mom was constantly on a diet, so I learned to count calories.  I think I restricted to around 1200, but I exercised constantly.  I would take long bike rides, walks, and dance to music in my bedroom.  I lost weight, went from 145 to 125 lbs.  I'm 5'6"".  

But then something happened.  I loved the feeling of control and wanted to see those numbers go down.  By the time I was a senior i weighed 85 lbs.  We lived in a TINY town, so there was no such thing as medical intervention.  I think I finally discovered that wasn't healthy, and I was college-bound.  I started eating a little more.

So then in college I discovered bulimia, except my purging was through excessive exercise and restriction following a binge.  I got up to a healthier weight, but then would fluctuate based on binge/purge cycles.  

I won't bore you with all the details, but know that I have struggled with these tendencies my whole life.  I finally stopped tracking my food a year ago--that was HARD, and it was a gradual process.  Not gonna lie, I still sometimes mentally calculate calories.  After tracking for so long, I can probably tell you the calorie count in everything, as you all know all too well.

What is helping me finally is learning to love myself.  This took so long, I don't want it to take that long for people on here, as I feel the majority of you are quite young.  I try to focus now on what my body can DO, instead of what I look like.  I focus on real food and not so much processed junk.   I'm getting to the age where I need to start thinking about remaining STRONG, not trying to disappear into thinness.  I work out every day, not to burn calories but to feel good.

Bottom line, LOVE yourself.  You ARE worthy.  Try to focus on LOVING your body, not punishing it.  Would you with hold food from your best friend?  NO!  Be good to yourself.  It's a process and it's not going to happen overnight.  But you MUST learn to love yourself first, that is truly the first step.  No one but you can make that happen.

You are all beautiful!  :)",,Encouragement,5,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,iitjzd,1,SweetKassie,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/iitjzd/encouragement/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/iitjzd/encouragement/,1598712349,447,0,0,0,-1,1,Learning to love oneself,helpful,"Focusing on what the body can do, not just appearance, Eating real food instead of processed junk, Working out daily to feel good instead of burning calories, Encouraging others to love themselves and focus on being good to themselves",Learning to love oneself,helpful,"Realizing that focusing on what the body can do instead of what it looks like is helpful, Focusing on eating real food and not processed junk, Working out to feel good, not to burn calories",Learning to love oneself and focusing on what the body can do instead of appearance,helpful,"Improved mindset towards food and exercise, Realizing the importance of self-love and worth"

That's why I'm creating this anthology: Art from those recovering and surviving, who have faced their individual battles during this quarantine, but are coming out with resilience—because we should feel pride at our place in our journey, wherever we are. Combining our poems, stories, journal entries, and visual art side by side, we can see the points at which our struggles intersect, and find strength in our shared battles.

I invite you to submit your poems, stories, journal entries, and visual art, exploring your experience with an eating disorder during the lockdown. You can submit anonymously, or with your name. I look forward to reading your stories.

Please feel free to reach out to me, at talia.ann.green100@gmail.com, with any questions—Or just to talk. I, and so many others recovering, are here to stand with you during your journey.

But yesterday after struggling with food for as long as I can remember I finally got a diagnosis from my new phycologist for my eating disorder (ARFID) and I feel way more at peace today, and like I can actually get better. 

I have been to the doctor multiple times over the years with no response other than taking blood being told I'm only slightly malnutritioned so just eat more. 

My relationship with food has never really been about my body image, I hate how skinny I look in the mirror but the physical manifestations have made feel impossible to eat more. I now have a plan in place to start fighting this and for the first time I can actually see a light at the end of the tunnel.

1500,1500,eating_disorders,"This year has been hella crazy! I was going to marry my fiance but he dumped me in mid-January. I have to move in with my parents (they were a major trigger from my ED) and then COVID-19 come in and I have been lock-in for the past two months.

But, not everything is bad... I'm still getting (online) therapy. The doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists and nutritionists that are helping are freaking amazing and I'm thankful for their work. I'm taking Paroxetine (12.5 mg) every morning and Trazodone (50 mg) for better sleeping. I was diagnosed with anxiety and EDNOS.

My parents have become a major part of my support system, I was finally able to talk to them about my anxiety and ED. They've been really supportive and I no longer feel like they're a burden or trigger...

I still miss my ex-fiance and that's honestly the most painful thing in my life right now, but I also feel all of this happened for a reason and maybe I needed this storm to lay back on and start working on being a better me.

The most important thing is that I haven't binged and purged since December 2019. I'm still learning to eat healthily and trying not to put that much pressure to lose weight. Yeah, sometimes I feel like losing it and I overeat, but that's honestly nothing compared to the binges I used to have.

The next step is setting actual goals: weight loss, better eating, more sleeping, etc. I'm shitless scare, but feel like I finally might be able to achieve those.

I hope one day all of this will be just part of my past: things that help me grow and be the woman I wanna be.

It would really help my anemia if I ate some red meat every now and then, but fish is going to be the main meat that I eat. 

I miss eating everything, not worrying about things and making up a mentality in which I have allergies that might not even exist. Since introducing a few things back in, I’ve felt better, happier, healthier. I look brighter, less tired, happier, healthier, and no longer skeleton like. 

My portions are getting bigger, and sometimes the voice gets to me but once I force it away and eat whatever I want, I feel great. I still need some help, and I know I need a doctor for that but I don’t think my mom would ever do that so I asked my dad to take me to the doctor over winter break and hopefully they can help me get this figured out. 

I know it’s not great on an eating disorder to choose a diet and stick to it, that’s why I’m choosing to bend the rules a little on the paleo/Keto lifestyle I have chosen. Red meat every now and then, fish and chicken for the most part but most definitely lots and lots of veggies and fruit, minimal dairy and bread/grains (pasta and such), and limit the dessert and snacks. Mix up gluten and gluten free, no added sugar and added sugar, dangerous white sugar for “healthier” sugar options, and so on. Just so I can eat whatever I want but with some guidelines to fall back on.

1764,1764,eating_disorders,"Hi!

I'm looking for someone who is successfully recovered, is in the process of recovering, or is getting geared up for recovery (basically, anyone not currently in a pro-ed mindset) who would like to be and would like to have a support buddy, and who doesn't mind communicating through WhatsApp or another messenger app. 

I am familiar with inpatient and outpatient treatments, many types of therapy, and many, many self-help programs and books (Brain Over Binge, multiple Recovery Workbooks, AA/OA, etc.) - you name it, I've probably tried it. And I am open to talking about and/or learning about any kind of therapy/program/belief system/etc. that there could possibly be. I want to support you through your journey, and I want you to be there to support mine - in whatever form and for however long that takes.

I am not attending meetings for it, but I have been working through the twelve steps of OA (overeaters anonymous). I've come face to face with step 5; admitting our wrongs to god, ourselves, and another human being. Oof. Can we skip that step? No. I'm determined to recover and this is the way I'm gonna do it. I just need the human being. Part of OA is finding a ""sponsor"" to support you through the rest of the steps and your recovery process. My buddy does not need to be part of OA, does not need to believe in God, does not need to know the twelve steps - none of that. If you do or are interested, great - that's a bonus. But if not, that's good too! I will not push my beliefs on you, I will not push the program on you, I will not put propaganda in your face. If you believe in a god, or whatever - that's great! If not, thats good too! I don't know what I believe in yet - I'm working on that. But I do, at the very least, believe in a Good.Orderly.Direction - meaning that I have the power, somewhere within me, to carry out the ""next good thing"" (the power to make and act out the right decision for me, in each moment). All I ask is that you have an open mind, try to respect my beliefs (whatever they end up being), and agree to equally considerate with yours (we can totally discusss them, and whatever else you like, but please keep your kool-aid in your own cup). 

My end goal is to quit my bulimic behaviours; \*\*no\*\* purging, \*\*no\*\* secret eating, and no \*\*need\*\* to binge. I'm taking this one day at a time, sometimes one minute at a time. I have cut down from purging 3-4 times/day to once/day, my next goal is to go a full day without purging (TODAY IS THE DAY! ...please...). I would like for us to be able to talk each other through binge urges (when both available), share feelings/thoughts/dreams/goals, and basically just be there for each other.

1867,1867,EatingDisorderHope,"As the title suggests, I’ve just weighed myself for the first time since early August. 

I went through a few years of restricting to the point where I physically struggled to stand up for long periods of time and then another few years of having no self control around food at all. I’ve never had the best relationship with my weight, and came to the conclusion 2 years ago that I would be happier if I stopped weighing myself regularly.

Until today, that was what I did. With that said, I’m now working on losing weight healthily (first attempt since all of my issues) and I would like to get back into weighing myself biweekly or even monthly, just so I can keep my Fitbit account updated. 

Anyway, I’m making this post because I didn’t feel that impending sense of doom, panic and guilt that I used to feel when I weighed myself. It was just a number and then... nothing.

1905,1905,edsupport,"Hey! I want your input and thoughts!

&amp;nbsp;

I’m writing a screenplay (20-30 min in length, fiction). As an ex-EDNOS sufferer, I want to portray an eating disorder in a subjective way. It's about a girl turning 19, who has tried cancelling her birthday since she is trying to starve herself, but her best friend is plotting a surprise party. We are going to view the world through her eyes, her illness.

&amp;nbsp;

But here's the thing: Even though I’m choosing a horror movie style (because that was how I experienced my disorder), I don’t want to trigger people who have suffered, or ""inspire"" people who can come to be suffering. I want to keep triggers DOWN. 

&amp;nbsp;

I want to focus on the lies and the social aspect of keeping an eating disorder up. I will focus on the obsession to remain in control.

&amp;nbsp;

**I have decided that the film will not:** Show numbers (scales, calories). Show the protagonist pulling her body in a mirror. Observe any very skinny body. Show “successful tricks” of how to lose weight. Make the protagonist have a job where she needs to look a certain way (model, actress, dancer).

&amp;nbsp;

**However, I do want to portray:** A binge. Purging. Excruciating hunger feelings. An obsession with food (but really, with control).

&amp;nbsp;

Do you think this can be portrayed without being too triggering? Or should I just accept that this will be a triggering film? Where is your line crossed?

&amp;nbsp;

I want to make this film partly because I think ED-films that ARE out there, aren't very good. They neither help anyone close who wants to understand, nor validates the one who has suffered who wants to be understood.

&amp;nbsp;

Discussing this with you who have also suffered/are suffering would mean the world to me - we don’t need yet another lousy depiction of our illnesses.",,Portraying ED in Film,2,,,,,,t5_2x0ty,70mhm3,1,Alolboba,,/r/edsupport/comments/70mhm3/portraying_ed_in_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/edsupport/comments/70mhm3/portraying_ed_in_film/,1505639018,314,0,0,0,-1,1,"Creating a fictional screenplay portraying an eating disorder in a subjective way, wanting to keep triggers down, focusing on the lies and social aspect of keeping an eating disorder up, and validating the experiences of those who have suffered from an eating disorder.",helpful,"The writer is seeking input on whether their proposed film can be portrayed without being too triggering, and is open to feedback from those who have suffered from an eating disorder.

Some thoughts from a guy who struggled with binge eating disorder for 10 years...

I've seen an unfortunate trend on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, etc. Instead of taking steps to stop binge eating, people post sad quotes or images of food they're about binge on. **Why!?!**

It's almost like they're trying to get support from people to continue with their destructive habit. And trust me, I know how it feels to experience depression, even despair, because you think you'll be doomed for the rest of your life. 

But instead of keeping yourself in that cycle, **do something to break yourself free!** Stop thinking of yourself as a ""disordered"" person. *Isn't it possible that you're a completely normal person who developed a bad habit by mistake?*

All I'm saying is that you can CHOOSE to change your life. You just have to decide to do it. 

That's all I wanted to say today. **Maybe it's the words that you needed to hear.** For more info and extra help, I have a complete guide on everything I did stop binge eating for good.

1914,1914,edsupport,"Hello :)
I wanted to share this here in case anyone may benefit from it. 
I started a blog about my recovery from anorexia. I talk about my own experiences with anxiety, an eating disorder, and my attempts at self-acceptance. I thought I'd share the link in case anyone may end up reading it and identifying with anything I've written. My blog posts tend to be long &amp; I've done them for a little while now, but I figured I'd share it just in case, by some miracle, someone feels helped or understood by it. I also write about my opinions and experiences as well. Even though I highly doubt any of it is really read by anyone, it still always feels good to write!
I'm not fully recovered yet but I'm getting treated for anorexia right now and am on my path to getting better. I've had this disorder for many years and I compiled a list of activities/things that I have found super helpful in recovery! 
Certain posts could potentially be triggering, I do make sure that I don't say any numbers (I don't mention amounts of calories or weight) but I don't know what may or may not trigger some individuals! I do write this blog with the intention of reaching out to others who are struggling too so I hope it is not at all doing the opposite of what I intend!

2062,2062,EDAnonymous,"*Note: I would like to acknowledge that if you are restricting in some form, the binging more likely is! Correlation ≠ causation though, and i want to validate you all who may be binging for reasonss outside of a restricted food intake.*

Binging isnt always caused by restriction, and we need to talk about it! 

Constantly, I am received with answers of ""eat more!"" ~~I am eating more, and at this point actively gaining.~~ 

With an eating disorder, I think we are all fully aware of when we eat enough, and when we do not. Lately, I have been eating ""enough."" In the past when I struggled with binge eating, I was eating enough ~~I was eating *more* than enough, actually. Childhood trauma fucks you up.~~. 

And if this is you, you may wonder why you still binge. 

You most likely don't have BED. **THE BINGE RESTRICT CYCLE DOESN'T ALWAYS STEM FROM THE RESTRICTION.** If you have a restrictive ED &amp; are actively restricting though, it most likely does *play a part* in those binges. 

However you *can* [also] be someone who uses food to aide in other things. And this isn't always a bad thing - when balanced with other coping skills. 

Here are some reasons you may be binging:
- self sabotage 
- ADHD/underestimation
- happiness chasing
- emotional regulation
- self beliefs
- addiction(s)
- habit
- unsatisfied with something *not* regarding food
- childhood habits
- anxiety 
- excitement or rewarding
- AND restriction! Because let's be real, we all have EDs here and they are all multifaceted 

For me, self sabotage is a big one! ~~That's why I  feel invalidated when told to eat more and honor that ""mental hunger""~~ It's not even about the food, it's just about making myself sick. Too sick to attend whatever is giving me anxiety, sickness as a punishment, &gt;!throwing up due to an upset stomach!&lt; and spending the rest of the next day in pain. 

That's not to say restriction isn't the cause sometimes (it oftentimes is and can be). But for many, it may not be the direct cause at all! 

Still, restriction is a shitty coping skill too. It's just as ineffective as binging. 

It's important to find new coping skills &amp; emotional regulation skills outside of food. *And* it's still OK to use it as a skill once in a while!! Treating yourself to food is fine. If using a skill on occasion keeps you safe, that is the more important outcome. 

So I guess what I'm saying is check yourself, don't judge yourself, and be open with yourself about why you think you're binging. Because for some people, I really do think the binging comes first - then the restriction. And then suddenly, you're trapped in the horrible cycle.",,Binging isn't ALWAYS caused by restriction,1,,discussion,,,"[5'1"" | 18F | EDNOS | N]",t5_rbmui,10mhcnl,1,Raging_Coffee,grey,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10mhcnl/binging_isnt_always_caused_by_restriction/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10mhcnl/binging_isnt_always_caused_by_restriction/,1674813873,465,0,1,0,0,1,Binging not always caused by restriction,helpful,"Providing validation for those who may be binging for reasons outside of a restricted food intake, Listing reasons why someone may be binging, including self-sabotage, addiction, and anxiety, Encouraging finding new coping skills outside of food and being open with oneself about why they are binging","Binging not always caused by restriction, and can be due to various reasons like self-sabotage, addiction, habit, emotional regulation, etc.",helpful,"Validating people who may be binging for reasons outside of a restricted food intake, Encouraging finding new coping skills and emotional regulation skills outside of food",Binging for reasons outside of restricted food intake,helpful,"Disproving the notion that binge eating is always caused by restriction, Providing a list of reasons why someone may binge, Encouraging the development of new coping skills and emotional regulation skills outside of food"

I’m starting to see just how much of an impact I’ve made on her life because every time I see her, she has this like glow on her face and is just so happy. I think I’ve even heard her call me “Ate” once (which basically just means older female-familial? Figure? Idk how to translate). 

She always seems the most well behaved and happiest when I’m with her. 

She reminds me a lot like my younger sister before our mom lowkey pressured her ass the same way she did to me, plus before me and my family were better off economically. 

Looking at it now, my actual younger sister definitely is starting to have symptoms of mental illness (she’s only 12… ironically the same age I started having some but I didn’t know it at the time).

Anyways I think I genuinely wanna try to get better for her and my actual younger sister. Because I don’t want either of them to experience what I experience. 

I’m praying that nothing really bad happens to the kid at the center who called me “Ate” because she deserves all the Cleo’s and Donkey Kongs in the world. 

And I’m praying that it isn’t too late for my sister and that she won’t ever get as bad as me.

Neither of them deserve that.

2083,2083,EDAnonymous,"So I thought I might share it with you. Whoever needs this now. I needed it back then. I felt like life was meaningless and like I had no purpose, with issues that go beyond ED but are often accompanying it. I felt like I liked nothing in life. I watched yt and a video had this ad that I somehow couldn't skip. I had to listen closer. It was such a beautiful ad.
There were so many different people. Everyone in their own frame, in their own environment, their own style,... And every single one of these people said:

""Trust me, it gets better.""

""It gets better.""

""It really gets better!""

So so so many people. And not only hearing the words but also the way they said it in their relieved or happy or calm melody. And the way their mimic went.

I felt like, if they all defeated their lowest point... Why wouldn't I?

I think that ad was one of the first pushes into a direction of allowing myself to get into a better headspace. And you know what? Life did get better. It really did. My life has meaning and purpose now. Not because I found it but because I created it. I discovered so many things, feelings, people, impressions, animals, fruits, sunsets, strengths, weaknesses,..... Didn't think I would ever be one to find beauty in small things. I would always despise those people back then. Well... What can I say. Life really did get better.

I just remembered this sentence today for the first time in nearly a decade now. And you know what's a bit funny? This ad was not even aimed at me. No, really it was about LGBTQ+ and coming out.

2109,2109,EDAnonymous,"So, I’ve been through the typical Anorexia, Bulimia, and BED. I’d say mainly in the past few years I’ve drifted into the BED side of it. And it’s sucked because so much of my confidence was gone away due to gaining weight (got to the point where I was definitely unhealthy and could potentially face some health conditions I am naturally predisposed to). 

But, I come here to say the cheesiest thing- recovery is slowly becoming possible. It’s not been fun, at all, but losing weight healthily, and not feeling hungry 24/7 (or uncomfortably full for a day) has become easier this past month.

I've been putting off cooking with him lately. I'm deep in a relapse, and could not handle the idea of cooking with someone watching. But he's been missing it.

Yesterday we finally cooked again after over a year. We made a hearty and healthy Daal recipe. It's pretty high in calories, so I made my little tweakments without him knowing. But it was still much more nutritionally full than what I usually eat.

2260,2260,EDAnonymous,"Decision freeze is real in recovery, and sometimes the fear can come from feeling like you have the take the ""perfect"" next step. In reality, there's no such thing as a perfect step (or even a ""right"" one).

The next best step is the one you take, because even if it ends up feeling wrong, you can take it as information so you can do something else next time. Recovery involves rewiring our old beliefs, so it's also very possible that any step you take in towards healing will feel ""wrong.""

But if we take a step back to think about where the judgment of ""wrong"" is coming from, it's most likely not our true self, and it's not coming from our values. At the end of the day, those disordered beliefs around food &amp; body come from external noise. It was planted in us from our environment, and while it's unfair that we were told these things, we can change them.

If you're feeling stuck about what to eat, for example, ask: ""what would I eat if I believed that all foods are good?"" Even if you don't believe that (yet), you can act as if you do.

Over time, we can unlearn and rewire these automatic thoughts so it doesn't feel so hard to take care of ourselves with compassion.

Until then, take any step at all.

I wanted to ask you all a question. Im a disabled fat girl attempting recovery from my ed (EDNOS, restriction binging and purging with induced vomiting and laxative abuse)
I go to the gym a lot, but all the recovery pages as we know are full of stick thin orthorexic girls that are obviously still sick and not recovering… no hate to them at all, it isnt their fault they are sick, but it is unrealistic and it makes me sad that these girls are our « role models » in a way and I think it would be good, though scary, to make an insta page with gym fits, workouts, meals etc to show what actual recovery is like. I know i wouldnt have been so scared to recover if i saw girls gain weight in true recovery and learn to love and accept it, like ive had to.

The thing is that, besides I still have allowed and forbiden foods, I really came to the realization that I haven't weighted myself in maybe almost a year and I have also stopped counting calories.

There was a time that these things would accupied most of my thoughts and did it several times every day. I stopped doing this when, instead of helping me to lose weight, the anxiety would be so much that it would lead me to binge a lot. So, for mental heath and more control over food, I stopped this behaviour and suddenly I could controled my portions better, without counting kcals and started to avoiding scales easily, but always aware of how my clothes fitted me to guide me, of course.

It's been a journey, and yet I know I still have some issues.

Although at some point counting calories and scales helped me to lose weight, that wasn't the case anymore. It started to make me feel more anxious about food and I started to gain and gain more weight. At some point It was devastating. And I break down.

Now I'm even afraid to know how much I weight and how much calories I'm eating in a day. I still stimate it but not I'm not tracking for an specific number. And now I just know that I'm keeping my weight by the way the clothes fit me.

I have never posted in this group before and I suppose the reason I haven’t is because I don’t have your typical ED.. I have ARFID that has also developed into a manifestation of both ARFID and Anorexia. 
I guess after reading some of your posts I felt like a bit of a fraud, like I don’t have a real ED, but I do relate to a lot of the things you all have said both in posts and comments. 

Anyway, 
My story is a long one so I won’t share it all. Basically I am so scared that food is going to kill me that I only have a select amount of safe foods and essentially I almost lost my life from how much I’ve restricted. 

My country is useless at helping people both in the mental health and general health sectors so I am on my own along with many others who live here.. 
my best friend died from her ED in Nov because this country is a joke. 
in saying this I hope I can inspire someone. 

My NY resolution has been to put my health first. No 21 year old should be scared and anxious about heart problems caused by their ED and I don’t want to be anymore. Enough is enough and I want to live my life. 

Well.. in the past 2 weeks I have tried close to 10 new foods. 
Admittedly it has been hard trying not to a) panic over the new foods killing me and b) thinking about how I don’t want to gain weight from these new foods BUT I also know that if my country won’t help me then I need to be the one to take the lead. 

Today I ate one of my biggest fear foods - potato chips. Still in shock that I’ve done it but I can’t shake this feeling of accomplishment.

2416,2416,EDAnonymous,"i switched from low res to high res recently and have found im binging sm less, obviously bc my body isn’t completely starved of everything. my weekly deficit has become lower as the binge days were becoming more frequent on low res. i also have more energy and am losing at a more steady/healthier pace. 

idk why i didn’t do this sooner as clearly life isn’t falling apart as much anymore and my hair loss has slowed, as well as i’m a lot more energetic. 

so i’d say for the people that can mentally let themselves go up to high res, do it. because even though it sounds counterintuitive and like you’ll ruin your progress, it actually helps it and you really don’t binge anymore and if you do it’s not nearly as much food as before.

i did struggle with letting myself go up, and thought it would also make me invalid, but it hasn’t made me gain anything (as ik that’s what scares most), and i feel better abt myself bc the scale isn’t constantly zig zagging after a binge.",,binging sm less,1,,harm reduction,,,,t5_rbmui,10f55we,1,Edwrdscssrhnds,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10f55we/binging_sm_less/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10f55we/binging_sm_less/,1674041495,182,0,0,0,-1,1,Switching from low res to high res,helpful,"Less frequent binge days and bingeing less food, More energy and losing weight at a healthier pace, Slowed hair loss and feeling better about themselves",Switching from low res to high res,helpful,"Experiencing less frequent binge days, Having more energy, Losing weight at a more steady and healthier pace, Slowed hair loss",Switching from low res to high res,helpful,"Binging less frequently and losing weight at a healthier pace, Having more energy and experiencing less hair loss, Feeling better about themselves and not gaining weight as feared"

Still feel upset and exhausted because binging keeps me up late, but weirdly proud of this tiny win.

2432,2432,EDAnonymous,"I've been seeing this guy on and off for the last year and over the weekend I ran into him at a shitty/great dive bar metal show. I brought him home, had a jolly good time, then the next day I asked him out all date-like cause I fancied him. 

I get rejected a lot so I wasn't surprised by his answer but the weird part for me was that all my fun lil' starvation impulses didn't pop up much, they were actually pretty easy to ignore this time. I've been going to therapy for a while but I think this is the first time that I'm actually noticing a real success, which I think is good? When he said no I didn't think he'd love me if I were smaller or spiral for control like I usually do, which kinda scares me, but it's also what I've been working so hard towards.

I'm just kinda happy about it all, y'know? Minus the sharks of rejection of course.

2436,2436,EDAnonymous,"backstory -
i have a history of EDNOS? (not sure of the correct diagnosis) where i would fast up to 4 days and suddenly break and have a massive binge. or sometimes i would try to count my calories and have an extremely low and unachievable goal and meet it for a few days only to binge and give up. So i have always been unable to count my calories in a consistent and productive way. this is hard as i’m very into the gym (which is what pushed me to recover) and i am still not okay in my body and would like to be a bit more lean. i’ve fixed my body dysmorphia a little bit and no longer want to look skeletal i just want to look lean and healthy.

so here’s the win, i was recently motivated to start eating better and decided to download lose it, and i gave myself the least possible calorie deficit, although it was tempting to go for the higher ones. and i’ve now stuck to it consistently for a week and i really feel like this is something i could do long term and ive finally made peace with calorie counting.",,Finally beginning to change my habits :),1,,recovery wins!,,,,t5_rbmui,10er7a0,1,edgyteen-420,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10er7a0/finally_beginning_to_change_my_habits/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10er7a0/finally_beginning_to_change_my_habits/,1673998169,201,1,0,0,1,1,"History of EDNOS, difficulty counting calories in a consistent and productive way",helpful,"Successfully started using the Lose It app to count calories with the least possible calorie deficit, Feels like they could stick to it long term and has made peace with calorie counting","History of EDNOS, difficulty with calorie counting",helpful,"Successfully sticking to a consistent and achievable calorie deficit for a week, Feeling more at peace with calorie counting and seeing it as a tool for achieving their fitness goals","Struggles with EDNOS, history of fasting and bingeing, difficulty with consistent and productive calorie counting",helpful,"Recently motivated to start eating better and downloaded Lose It app, Gave themselves a small calorie deficit and stuck to it consistently for a week, Feels like they have finally made peace with calorie counting"
