1,1,EatingDisorders,"I 26 f told the truth for the first time about my eating disorder to my boyfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years now. I've been bulimic since I was a child.

Lately it's been particularly difficult, I don't have a nice life for many reasons that I'm not gonna explain here, because even though this is anonymous I'm not ready to talk about it. 
I find extremely difficult to talk about my problems, I usually bottles up everything. 
I didn't eat for the last 3 days. I've quit smoking 2.5 years ago and today smoked 6 cigarettes. Half an hour ago I was with my boyfriend and, I don't know fucking why I told him everything. I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me.

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you.

22,22,EatingDisorders,"I am very confused as to why my body reacts that way that it does to inconsistent nutrition. In no way am I starving myself but for someone reason if I miss breakfast or just whatever I struggle to eat later. It's like my body is fighting me against every bite.

I honestly have tried so many things to reduce the stress on my body- rapid breathing, yoga, exercise, sleeping early, trying not do do anything all day and just sit around, trying to eat consistently every few hours or so, masturbating, medications that are supposed to help with anxiety/depression.... I even tried having a romantic relationship with someone that I had probably shouldn't have because I thought maybe doing so (for the first time in my life) could somehow help me out of my predicament. I didn't follow through on that because it seemed a little illogical. 

I honestly hate being in this state because it's like I'm alive but can't actually have a life. I can't do so many things that I want to- some of which are just simple things like study and work- and in the absence of these I just don't know what the heck my life is worth. I've been this way for seven years and every day I wake up and think - today's going to be different, today somehow I'll have three decent meals and snacks and record my meals and I'll do what it takes to nourish my body. and every day WITHOUT FAIL, I DO NOT SUCCEED.

I used to be so ambitious and hardworking and felt like my life was in my hands but this issue has honestly stymied me on every front. I can't even understand why this keeps happening because I don't have an eating disorder mentality anymore and I want to have fun and live my life and meditate but I can't do any of these things because I always feel like something is off in my body but not like a medical diagnosis just a lack of adequate food and sleep. 

I don't understand how or why this happened. I just want it to be over and every day that goes by with me continuing to live like this just is worsening my health.

My 1 year old is just now starting to chew (due to food allergies delaying his start on solids) I didn’t understand why he was so clingy and whiny recently until my mom asked when the last he ate was. She was shocked when I told her than I had only given him two bottles of formula all day (11-6) I held it together when she was here but broke down when she left. I didn’t even realize that I was neglecting his health due to me being absent minded about food.

34,34,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone, over the last 3 years I have struggled pretty heavily with food. I'm gonna summarize what's happened so far, and will put my question after this paragraph if you want to skip.

I used to be very very obese, and I decided to start slowly eating better. I also started fasting. A few months into this, I went to the doctor, and got some scary blood work. An almost too high a1c. My lab numbers have always been bad, but the a1c sent me into a health anxiety tailspin. I kept cutting stuff out and eating less and less. I also slowly took on a keto diet. I also started regularly working out. I started to test my blood sugars all the time. I would even challenge myself by drinking a bunch of sugar water and testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours. My numbers were always normal. My fingers would be bruised all the time. Then, I started having some bad body symptoms. Basically a tremor. I freaked out and went to the doctor. Got a bunch of blood tests that showed malnutrition. I was asked about my caloric intake, and after thinking for a while I realized I was eating basically nothing. I started to bulk up my meals with low carb stuff: cheese, veggies, nuts, meat, and felt a lot better. Still tested my sugars whenever I ate carbs. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm close to a healthy weight now, all my numbers are pretty great, except my cholesterol is a touch high, but not as high as it was when I was heavy.

Well, now I'm concerned about my low carb diet, and I want to move toward a more balanced, healthy one. I'm terrified, because carbs equal blood sugar testing for me, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time. My concern is, could this just be an evolution of my disordered eating? Being so concerned with healthy foods that it's just bringing me out of a low carb diet and into a Mediterranean one? I'm so exhausted. This takes up most of my thoughts every day.

47,47,EatingDisorders,"Hey Reddit!

I have been dealing with stress eating / emotional eating from few years. I completely lost hold of myself over the years as I ended up taking stress alot (an abusive relationship, another failed relationship, job related stress, not so peaceful home life, Covid era and the likes).

I have always loved food however this also meant with even a minute feeling of stress I would reach over to the food that is available to me at the earliest or my comfort food which is usually junk. I did not realise how this was impacting me until my weight tremendously increased. The effect is visible on my face, my belly, my arms the most. It was too late by the time I realised and now I genuinely do not know how to stop. 

I work a stressful job and I have constant hunger pangs and I reach out to food. No matter how hard I am trying I am unable to recover.

51,51,EatingDisorders,"Hey! So I'm about 2 weeks in recovery and slowly putting some weight on and logically I'm aware that that's a good thing, because I was very underweight and I should gain so that I can be a healthy weight. But. With a healthier weight come rolls. One of the many reasons why I did what I did is that I couldn't bear the feeling of skin/fat rolls when I slouched. I don't know how to be ok with having rolls when I bend or slouch, or pose myself in a sort of ""shrimp"" position. The sensation of light pressure the rolls give me makes me feel absolutely horrible. I know that the only reason I had basically no rolls before is that because I was severely underweight, but that doesn't stop me from feeling horrendous about having them now. It's more about the bodily sensation than the body image issues, I just can't stand the physical feeling at all.

I had a 45 min drive home and stopped by a Walgreens and I asked the pharmacist if they sold strips that would be able to detect if there’s sugar in a drink. She was confused at what I was asking for, and was going to sell me glucose strips. No. I want strips to see if my soda is diet or not.

I got home and I started frantically calling the club, the cafe in the club because I’m PISSED. Someone’s going to listen to me. No answer.

.

.

I have been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now with on and off recovery which never lasts long. 

In 2020 when covid hit i gained a bit of weight and became depressed then developed and ED, I have told my bsf about it and tbh she was not very understanding of it, she is one of those people who think its my chice and i could just eat. I obv can't change someone's thoughts and believes so i never really bothered. later that year i decided to start recovery and i mentioned it to her, while all my family were supportive of this decision, one time i was showing her my breakfast ( we used to send each other daily vlogs and stuff) and mentioning how I'm starting to be healthier and bla bla bla, she them replied back with ""OH MY GOD! You eat sooo much food wow, that's probably as much as my brother, wow."" This was the most triggering thing someone ever commented on my food. the thing is my ""big"" breakfast was too hard boiled eggs, 2 low carb crackers and a bunch of veggies... 

i felt sooooo guilty and i believed that it is too much and always been afraid to eat like that in fear of being perceived like so. Anyways, needless to say that it made me relapse immediately and honestly thinking of recovering is never serious as it was back then. 

The thing here is , she knows I've relapsed and i never really talked about my ed with her ever since. However, she still to this day says the most triggering things ever. Like ''Oh, i haven't eaten since yesterday."" ""I haven't eaten for 24hrs"" ""I only had tea for breakfast"" and so more of these, the thing is she does not have an ed... she just likes to brag like some of those people, and she knows that i have an ed and she still brags to me. 

she sometimes checks on me if i ate or not and all that but it doesn't really differ when i know that she believes I'm pathetic and ""its all my choice""

74,74,EatingDisorders,"I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

Since the day I was born, the only food my family has had in the house is unhealthy. It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. 

Everyone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. 

But it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. 

As I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. 

But I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. 

But I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die. 

If I ever told my parents, they would just see it as ""oh, she needs to eat more"" and force me to eat their unhealthy snacks. I want to be healthy. I want to live normally. But no one can help me. I'm trapped between death or death and for the next two years, I have no way out.

75,75,EatingDisorders,"So I'll try to shorten the story as much as possible since it's really long if I get into details (Spoiler: it ended up being extremely long anyway, oops!)

&amp;#x200B;

When I first met my gf she was still with her ex-bf of 4 years, but they had had a lot of issues and were always fighting so she wanted to break up with him but she felt bad thinking he would be sad about it. So she didn't leave him until some time after.

&amp;#x200B;

We started to get along and to meet more often, and eventually we showed attraction for each other and some night, probably drunk, we... did stuff. At that time I was really uncomfortable with my body already but knowing someone was attracted to me kinda helped to get through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and she eventually broke up with her ex, she had always told me she really liked me and would like to have a relationship but she couldn't because she was still with the guy. At this point I knew she would need time to be alone, to heal from her past, toxic relationship before getting into another one so I did that, gave her time.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually it was her bday and she made a party where she invited some of her highschool friends, she told me she used to fancy this one girl who was coming but she hadn't seen in a long time, and I thought nothing of it. Little did I know, she (my now gf) ended up getting drunk and making out with the girl she fancied in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

A week went by and she stopped giving me any attention when we were together and she was even more distant now, she spent the time we were together texting the girl in question and sending her love messages and stuff. She was never very affectionate with me whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I stopped talking to her at all. It made me feel extremely bad. I knew the other girl was hotter than me and prettier than I am and I was so jealous because of course she would rather be with her, I would too.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time after she texted me saying that she didn't know what happened or why we weren't okay (as in our friendship) and I ended up meeting with her. I had got a girlfriend at this point but I really, deep down, loved her so, after more rounds of gin that I can count, I ended up cheating on my gf.

&amp;#x200B;

So to finish this story, I broke up with my ex-gf and started dating her, and they lived happily ever after.

&amp;#x200B;

FALSE, those things that happened still haunt me to the date and I spent last night crying and couldn't sleep at all thinking about it and it has grown a lot of anxiety in me. I also I'm at my worst with my ED right now so I feel really bad overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the reason to this post is she is meeting with the girl she changed me with next Wednesday and I can't shake the thought that she preferred her over me. This is really triggering to me and I refuse to it anything until everything has passed. How can I get over what happened? Or how can I make it less triggering?

81,81,EatingDisorders,"8 months ago, I decided it was time for me to loose weight because I kept being told “you’re getting chubby” and whenever I ate too much chocolate, chips, ramen noodles and other things I loved, I was told “you’re gonna get fat” and was even told “your stomach is getting bigger”. I never cared about how much I ate, what I ate. I ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted. 

But after deciding to loose weight, I started eating as little as possible. Restricted myself from sugar, any junk food. Tried eating healthy and mostly veggies. Did an hour of workouts 6 times a week and eventually reduced it to 5 times a week. Ate 3 meals a day after every 3-4 and didn’t eat anything else after 8PM (my third meal would be before 8PM and that’s it). I started seeing results of loosing weight. It made me really happy because I started fitting in more nice clothes and was getting happier with my body. 

The thing is that I lost my period after like 3 months of the start of my journey to this. Started loosing a lot of weight and was having no trouble. Whenever I saw any junk food or any other food, I wouldn’t be feeling like eating it. I had control. Didn’t even crave junk foods anyway. 

Because I had lost so much weight and my period, my aunt got worried and took me to the doctor. The doctor weighed me and said I was underweight for my age and height. But I didn’t care anyways and continued to eat little and workout. 

But on my 8 month of my journey, which was on December 29, during the holidays, I started to binge. The binge happened on new years Jan 1st when I had to go to a family event and they gave me sweets. I told myself “I haven’t had any sugary thing for months and since this is a family one time thing I should enjoy myself” so I ate a cookie that was on the table, then ate another, then another and another. Then ate many of the fruits on the table. And after I was done, my stomach felt so full. 

After that day, in the next day, I ate more than usual. I love having oatmeal for breakfast and I always have it like every other day and only once a day. The next day I ate 2 oatmeal’s, one in the morning, one at night. I started having oatmeal everyday after that and ate 2 then eventually went to 3. Then I started eating junk food. Ate so many chocolate that was given to me during the holiday gifts, then ate so much Nutella, and chips with cream cheese. I kept basically binging. 

After the holiday weeks break was over for me (Jan 9), I said I’m gonna get back on track and eat healthy again. So I did for 5 days and had control of myself. After 5 days, I started to binge again till now. My stomach is getting bigger again and I’m scared to gain all the weight I had 8 months ago back again. I still worked out 5 times a week during the holidays while I was binging, and still am to this day. But the binging is making my stomach get bigger and my face chubbier. I don’t want to get back to how I used to look like. 

Recently I had to give a blood test because my doctor told me to since I still don’t have my period back yet for about 6-7 months and he said I need to reduce my workout to 2 times a week and eat more.

On the other hand, I keep binging and have no control even though I keep telling myself “this is my last binge I won’t do it again tomorrow”. Basically with the binging I am eating more. However, the fact that my stomach is getting bigger and my face puffier, it makes me feel guilty after every binge. I still workout 5 times a week but it’s 20-40 minutes a day. I don’t know how I was so consistent and no food made me loose control but after the holidays I lost control of myself. 

The doctor did tell me to eat more, and I want to listen but with the eating more, I want to eat healthier not binge on chocolate chips, so much peanut and almond butter and other things.

89,89,EatingDisorders,"So, just a little info: I’ve been vegetarian for 5 years, and went vegan about 2 years in and kept it up for about 2 more years. I realized being vegan, for me, was a little restrictive as I have some texture aversions and don’t like a lot of things (still veg), so a lot of times I wouldn’t eat at events or nights out. I definitely noticed a bit of disordered eating going on. It wasn’t normal, I looove food. I love eating!

Pretty often, probably like once a week or every two weeks this past year, I would throw up from being so hungry. Or, even if I wasn’t starving, just knowing that I’d have to go to a restaurant and eat something, even just imagining the smell or smelling it, made me sick and I’d have to go throw up in the bathroom mid-meal.

I’ve been absolutely wonderful the last probably 2-3 months and have been eating healthy, good amounts and didn’t feel sick or weird once. Never even thought about it. It’s been great.

Now, I’ve been really depressed for the entirety of the last week, and haven’t been eating. It got to a point where I was so hungry I threw up bile 2 days ago. I was sad again yesterday and only ate a few veggie sausages to start my day, and then was SO hungry later, and after I got and ate a few fries, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up.

Is there a label to out on this or? I’ve had an extremely sensitive, queasy stomach since I had COVID, so maybe that’s it. I don’t know.

I try to eat consistently (snacking) to avoid getting so starving, but I don’t want anything. I quit one of my jobs so I have a lot of time now and that always throws me off. I need routine.

90,90,EatingDisorders,"Hi, this is, I believe, my first post and I need some help. I suspect one of my siblings may have had an eating disorder for a while now, but I don't know how to help. Although we have mentioned how this said sibling has gotten thinner and skipped meals and such, my mom makes every excuse to stray away from the idea that her child might need help. She either points out the things he has eaten or just stays silent and changes the subject. I fear for my sibling because he did lose a lot of weight in comparison to last year, almost unrecognizable, but I guess he sees it as a good thing because he is a lot more talkative during school. From what I have seen, he drinks A LOT of water bottles, even one time mentioning to us that if we ever wanted to lose weight just drink water until your stomach hurts. I do not know why these talks seem so normal in our family.

92,92,EatingDisorders,"so i (20 m) have struggled with eating disorders on and off for several years, and have recently been starting to feel myself relapsing, although i’m not shocked as it’s my first year at college and that’s obviously stressful for various reasons. (not that it matters but i’m currently in the supposed “healthy” weight range.)

i have a close friend (i’m gay and she’s a lesbian so it’s not romantic in any sense) at school who i hang out with a lot since we’re on the same floor. she tends to be a very physically affectionate person, (as in cuddling, hugging, leaning on you, etc). there’s a few things regarding boundaries i know i need to talk to her about, but theres one specifically that i have no idea how to bring up. 

basically if we’re like hugging or cuddling she always talks about how i’m so “comfy” and “squishy” and “warm” which i know she means as like a good thing? but it really triggers me honestly. i feel so stupid for being bothered by it, but it’s difficult when i’m already struggling to figure out how to establish boundaries without hurting her.

 for context, while i of course enjoy hanging out with her, she definitely has attachment problems and has talked a lot about probably having bpd, and it’s not like i’d ever judge her for that, but in the case that she does have bpd, i am very clearly her fp and i’m nervous about how she’d react because there’s been a handful of occasions where she’s gotten clearly upset with me even over things like me not wanting to hang out because i’m not doing well or i need to go to bed earlier. she’ll get very snippy and will barely talk to or acknowledge me, and contrasted with her being over the top affectionate and saying she loves me every few minutes (which also kinda makes me uncomfortable), it makes me feel like such an asshole. 

 i know i need to talk to her about stuff but i have genuinely never told anyone i’ve struggled with an ed, although i’ve vaguely mentioned having had “issues with food” when talking with a few people, her including her. i’m honestly just afraid that if i try to talk to her about stuff, i’ll end up leaving out how uncomfortable i feel when she makes these specific comments about my appearance/body (which happens several times a week)

I’ve been struggling with restrictive eating for a long time now. I’ve never gone to a psychologist for it so I’m not diagnosed but I often only eat one small meal a day or not eat at all, which if anyone asks i generally just say i do intermittent fasting. It got better while i was overseas and i began eating 3 meals a day again and I thought everything was getting better and I didn’t have to exercise everyday if i ate but since ive been back I’ve been restricting again- almost feeling like j have to make up for the fact that i ate so much on my trip. I havent eaten anything in two days atp and while i always know i should, its almost paralysing bc i weirdly feel proud of myself for holding out for so long and also not feeling  hungry? I also feel like bc I haven’t had the motivation to workout I shouldnt eat much to make up for it which I KNOW logically is so wrong but when i tell myself i know i have to eat or get something in me, i just feel like i cant move, like my body is resisting it.

106,106,EatingDisorders,"For the past couple of months I've struggled with my relationship with food. I would have random episodes of binge eating until I am physically ill from the amount of garbage I have put in myself, but still am unable to stop. That would cause me to feel shame and utter disgust with myself and the way I would pig out on shitty food to feel comfort. Eventually, I realised I do that whenever I'm going through a tough period or when I feel a lot of stress. Due to this behaviour, I would stop eating for days. E.g I would eat and apple and that would be my meal for the entire day. The pain of being hungry would be so strong that I just fall back into the same spiral and binge until I can't fit anything in my stomach. It caused me pain, disgust, shame and contributed to having poor mental health and self-esteem issues. I feel so weak for this because I cannot fathom how something can control me and my life this much up to a point where it affects my entire day and every waking hour. What should I do?

To give some back history; i had my son a little over a year and a half ago, when I got pregnant with him i was really struggling, to the point of where my primary doctor and mother had a sit down intervention type of deal and basically told me to get my sh- together or go get the tube and some more intensive rehab…Of course I took the latter, didn’t have much choice in the matter due to the fact I also got pregnant with my little dude not even a few weeks later… I started to get healthier mentally and emotionally and physically as well and things seemed so good! Then literally the complete and total unthinkable happened, the father of my son died out of no where via what they claimed as suicide but the entire thing was fishy and multiple sources close to him were telling me it was a set up..that’s besides the point..a year and a half later after genuinely grieving not only my best friend but father of my sons death as well as other close circle friends who ended up dying tragically..I’m here crawling myself out of a deep pit of depression, past drug addiction, recovery after ECT (for those of you who don’t know what that is it’s probably a therapy that should be illegal… or at least more regulated..) and just being a young mom and college student… it’s a balance for sure!! It’s like balancing jelly beans man and it’s hard! I have great support from my mom and a few select really supportive friends, otherwise though I struggle with being too big hearted, I always put those around me before myself and it costs me time, money, trauma…you name it. I’m struggling again because of it and that’s something I promised I’d never go back on, for me and for my son. I love him more than anything and I’d die for my son…but sometimes I genuinely struggle to live for my son. I was in a lockup rehab for a year when I was younger and patronized even by my therapist when it came to eating, of course there I learned lots of “tricks” and what not.. I’m tall so of course weight distribution is present for sure so I never seemed under until I looked under the weather lol, my therapist was honestly pretty demeaning when it came to really anything and honestly that messed me up especially since my parents being as desperate for help as they were, they
didn’t know what to do and of course went to a really expensive and almost occultist type vibe promising “a perfect daughter”, i kid you not the thing wasn’t even on google maps at the time, they did a lot of illegal shit which I actually found out about after I had gotten myself out and reconnected with old peers (story for another time) anyways; now a days I struggle. I’m a lot more aggressive due to everything that’s happened, a lot more paranoid (C-PTSD, DV survivor which is another story that explains a few years of b.s. but also explains alot of where I am now regarding pretty much everything in my day to day) I’m a whole lot more unhinged I guess, and the worst part is I’m hiding it 100x better apparently but I’m not meaning to I think it’s just disassociation??

I’m paying two times my rent to support my family, I’m going through a lot with friends and close relationships and now I can’t eat anything without freaking the hell out..

I really need yall opinions on this. And if you want to see what we talked and what else he said to me you can come to chat with me so i can put screenshots to you, so that you can better express your opinion.

The more weight I lost, the less I would eat, and the less I would eat, the easier it was to not binge. I would challenge myself to meet unhealthy goals, and I almost always met them. 

I stopped “dieting” for a few weeks after having my gallbladder removed and spent some time moderating while still eating what I wanted. Then I had a day where I couldn’t stop eating. I had one of my worst binging episodes ever and ended up violently ill the following day. 

I thought that would be my rock bottom and not binging would be easy after that, but I find when I eat the way I should, it makes me want more, making it nearly impossible not to binge. When I eat little to nothing, binging isn’t an issue so I tend to opt for that. I know this isn’t healthy, but I can’t find a happy medium. I feel doomed to a life of eating disorders no matter what I do.

She is in therapy, but her ED seems to be such a touchy topic for her. I can’t really get her to open up about it, which is fine- but I don’t think she talks to her therapist much about it either.

Sometimes she’ll say stuff like “Gosh, I haven’t eaten all day”, or when I’ll offer her food because I know she hasn’t eaten, she’ll refuse it. I don’t want to pressure her, and she’s told me before that the more people press her for info, the less she wants to eat.

Recently my sister has been saying all the time “I haven’t eaten all day” when we are sitting down for dinner or just throughout the day.

I go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn’t get completely out of hand.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

Before she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don’t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.

166,166,EatingDisorders,"I have a therapist that I see regularly for dealing with PTSD and this morning I brought up having some issues with eating over the past three months. I’ve been ignoring it because I already have enough issues, but my doctor is concerned about my weight loss (currently at xx  lbs when I need to weigh yy lbs minimum ... a significant amount) and my clothes have started hanging off of me.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and her husband (not my bio dad) always made comments about gaining weight even though I’ve always been thin and athletic. I think they were maybe projecting, idk. Lots of “once on the lips, twice on the hips”, “weight gain in your face is hard to lose and your face is round enough” (my face is not round at all), and other comments about my stomach having fat rolls (again, I have always been athletic, so these did not exist).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not really sure why it would be manifesting now that I’m in my early 20s; their comments usually went in one ear and out the other but now I can’t help but think that I look overweight. Particularly in my face, stomach, and hips. I know that, logically and realistically, I do not have any excess weight but I still fixate on it. I’m not super obsessed with counting calories or anything like that, but I do go one or two days at a time without eating on a regular basis and when I do eat, it’s usually something small like a bowl of cereal. I’m just worried I’ll put on weight, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not sure why it’s only now becoming an issue, but both my doctor and my therapist agree that I need to see someone about this. My therapist said this morning said that it sounds like I might have some body dysmorphia and an ED, but unfortunately that isn’t what she specializes in. She wants me to find an ED specialist and schedule an appointment with them by next Wednesday. And I’m also supposed to meet with my doctor about healthy meal plans and diets at some point.

169,169,EatingDisorders," 

Hi Reddit. I’m 16, and a guy. I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen, and I think it’s affecting me largely enough to reach the point of an eating disorder of some kind.

I’m not going to detail too much as that’s not really what this post is about, but I restrict, I think as a result of both being unhappy with the way I look and feeling out of control of other things around me. I feel guilty about not eating healthily or exercising as much as I should, but in trying to do so I have always just ended up making myself feel worse and doing it for the wrong reasons. I used to develop a lot of weird stomach issues and with the handful of medications I’ve cycled through quite a few have really messed with my appetite, including my ADHD medication which of course I take daily. I’ve tried to deal with it on my own but as my general mental health has been improving a lot (which I am so grateful for), my habits and thoughts around eating have not and I think it might be time for me to get help.

I’ve mentioned my eating somewhat in passing to my mom and my former therapist, but neither seemed to understand fully what I was getting at. One of the first things I talked to my therapist about was how I felt I did not think of food in a healthy way but it was kind of just left there, and I mentioned to my mom when she began to notice my eating habits getting worse again during the very first lockdown here in Canada how I sometimes eat less if it means feeling in control of something. That was basically where the conversation ended. I don’t blame either of them because I have a hard time accurately describing things and minimizing them when I do, and I didn’t quite talk about the extent of these thoughts and behaviours.

I’m afraid to ask anybody for help and talking properly about how bad it’s gotten in the past and how it affects me day-to-day, even on good days, because I feel a strong sense of shame surrounding this aspect of my mental health. People generally think of EDs as a ‘girl thing’ which logically I know is absolutely not true and in theory I know that there’s no shame in the struggle that I’m having, but when I think about telling somebody and having them look at me and KNOW that this is something that’s on my mind all the time, I just feel so mortified. The thought of telling my mom makes me feel ill, and I have a very strong relationship with my mom and tell her everything, she’s been my main support through every other struggle I’ve had with my mental health and she’s supportive and understanding beyond what I would have ever hoped. But I just can’t stomach the idea of telling her more about this than I already have. I’m scared of telling anybody. The only person who really knows is my best friend, who also struggles with it. He’s the only one I’ve ever really talked about things in detail with, but of course he can only do so much and generally we steer away from talking about it with each other to avoid triggering the other or something.

Even typing this and sharing with people who will never know my name or anything about me other than this, I feel terrible. I don’t even really know why. I guess by admitting that something is wrong in more than my own head means it’s more real and I’m not ready for things to turn upside down to make me better somehow, and also maybe I just don’t want things to not be okay. I don’t know. But I’m really not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel like this all the time and trying to fix it on my own hasn’t worked but I also don’t want to talk to people and have them see me the way I see myself, as weak or something. I don’t know. I’m also scared of what treatment might look like for me. The idea of meal plans or being monitored in any way or anything just makes me feel sick and the idea of eyes on my eating habits more than they already might be makes me feel so anxious. I feel like I’m not ready to get help yet but I’ve also been telling myself that for years and I really want to feel better and be able to eat without feeling guilty. Sorry for the long post, I just really don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go or who to talk to, I considered talking to a teacher I trust but again I’m scared of how they might see me and I’m scared of burdening them with my issues or making them worry or something.

Thank you in advance for any and all help. I don’t entirely know what I’m looking for, because I don’t know if I will end up getting help any time soon.

My body gets hungry, really hungry, but the thought of eating is absolutely repulsive. My stomach can be growling but still, the thought of eating is so unpleasant. The only “food” I can really think about eating without getting nauseous is like Naked Juices and soup, but let’s be honest, it’s unrealistic to switch to “drinking meals” for the rest of my life so I’d like to relearn how to want to eat food. I haven’t always been like this, maybe the past 2 years or so. I remember I used to not mind chewing, I used to crave food. It’s starting to become a real issue because it takes me forever to get anything done because my life revolves around forcing myself to eat. I don’t not eat, I pretty much snack instead of eat meals because I can’t sit down and enjoy a meal. I can “handle” snacks because it’s only a couple bites I have to force down. When I force myself to eat (everyday) it’s so unpleasant. It sucks to force yourself to eat but I do it because I know I need to eat, I know I can’t skip meals and be healthy. I’m happy with my body and I force myself to eat because I like to stay active and you can’t really be active if you don’t eat. So, it’s not like I’ve convinced myself that I hate food because I’m afraid to gain weight, that’s not it at all.

I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I’m not like that but that’s how I’d talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don’t understand.

For six+ months I’ve been doing so much better. Today, a friend of mine told me I look like someone (tiktok) famous, who just so happens to be plus size (makeup videos, their body is never even in shot). They’re a beautiful person, and their makeup is amazing, and all of the comments are telling her how beautiful she is, and she is beautiful. But how come after six + months of doing ok, it broke me? I haven’t felt this triggered in so long. I had my first meal at 2pm today after work (unplanned, but something me a year ago would’ve been proud of) and after receiving her message saying I looked like her, I suddenly felt disgustingly guilty about eating as I was about to take my last few bites. I didn’t take them, and now I’m scared about how long this fog will last.

I’ve never been that triggered about anything before during my improvement with food until now. It feels so scary, it feels like I want to hide and not eat and not wear anything nice or do my makeup or see anyone at all. It makes me think about what I was like a year ago, and my brain starts whispering that it’s a good idea, I deserve to go back there, it’s what I need. I know it’s not right, I know my brain is horrible for thinking these things not just about myself, but for it thinking the person I apparently look like is a negative way to look.

182,182,EatingDisorders,"A bit of background, I’ve struggled with a restrictive ED for about ten years now; things have been up and down but things were actually going pretty well for me up until recently. I had to attend an occupational health meeting for my new job a few months ago (I am a doctor myself) just to go through my medical history and my ED was brought up. I definitely got the impression that the doctor seeing me had a slight judgmental tone (if not a bit disapproving); although I’m used to it, as I’ve had bad experiences as a patient when doctors/health professionals find out I’m a doctor struggling with ED. She then asked about all my ED behaviours in detail, which I felt extremely uncomfortable talking about as she was a complete stranger and even with therapists it takes some time to open up. She weighed me as well, which I suffer a lot of anxiety from and have not done so in a long time. After all that, she kind of ‘lectured’ (?) me about how I need to maintain a ‘healthy’ weight and if I lost too much weight then they would have to remove me from my job and I couldn’t return to work until I’d recovered my weight, plus another few months on top of that.

I get where she was coming from. But ever since that meeting (I was cleared for work which was fine, there weren’t any concerns) I’ve felt it really triggered a lot of past behaviours and anxiety.

So, between the ages of 15-19ish I struggled with an undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder. As far as physical symptoms go, it never got that severe, but it was extremely mentally taxing, as it consumed a majority of my daily thoughts. Eventually, the obsession with it subsided as I got more determined to recover for the sake of my future family.

Fast forward to several years later, and I'm living off of my savings in college, besides a small income from a part-time minimum wage job. I had all these plans for what I wanted to cook and eat for myself in college so I could eat healthier (meaning, actually eating fruits and veggies on a daily basis and skipping the ramen). But sticker shock quickly set in; combine that with anxiety about my financial future, laziness from depression and schoolwork, and I've headed the opposite direction. I find myself avoiding buying food under any circumstance. I avoid going to the grocery store, I avoid going out to eat, I feel good every time I skip a meal because I think of the money I'm saving.

However, I haven't started eating more, despite having less reason not to. My parents are kind enough that they're now giving me $20 a week for food. I find myself feeling unreasonably guilty about eating my boyfriend's food. And besides, I'm rarely in the mood to eat, especially if I'm really hungry. Occasionally, I just feel a general fear of eating food.

But it's not like I'm afraid of getting fat, like before. I rather wish I were more muscular and curvier. Although I will admit that, deep down, very specific things like seeing a bigger number on a scale, or pants feeling tighter trigger me.

Is this an eating disorder? If you have any coping strategies or directions I can pursue out of this, that would be great.

Hello,

Recently I haven't been eating all that much. I've definitely lost weight, and although that is a good thing as I am overweight, I don't think its happening in a healthy way. You see, I recently started my second year at college. Last year I had similar eating issues, as I had found going to the cafeteria to be exhausting and a drag on my day, so eventually I kinda just stopped going unless I absolutely had to eat something. This year its kind of the same, except I'm eating even less and I've developed this anxiety, almost like a sense of dread, that comes on when I think about having a full meal. Even when I do challenge that anxiety and go to the caf to get some food (since I know I need to eat), I find it difficult to actually get a solid amount of food down. Every single time there's always something left on my plate, and although I want to eat it, I simply can't. Today, I couldn't even finish one piece of lasagna. It tasted fine, but getting it down made me feel like I was going to throw up.

I feel like this lack of eating is leading to brain fog and a general feeling of low energy, and I don't know what to do about it. I want to eat more, but my body isn't agreeing. I also have this weird feeling in my stomach that happens when I'm hungry but it feels so odd that if anything it makes me not want to put anything in my stomach over fear I might chuck it all up. I don't really know what to do anymore and I'm starting to get really worried about this. Its stressing me out a lot. Has anyone else here had symptoms like this? Do you know what to do about it?

Also as a sidenote I am bipolar type two and have been in therapy for many years, am on medication to control mania and depression aswell as insomnia, and I smoke weed daily, usually to relax and go to sleep.

First of all, I want to apologize if I unintentionally trivialize anyone’s experience or display any ignorance/insensitivity for eating disorders or someone’s specific circumstances. A firm trigger warning for starvation, major weight loss and weight gain, medication abuse, and a pretty in-depth description of what’s going on in my mind.

This is the first time I’m ever talking about any of this, like, ever, since I bury it in a deep and shameful part of my conscience, so I apologize if this is a bit of a vent. When I was in middle school (I am now a uni student), I was overweight. It wasn’t significant and I never had a problem with it — in fact, I never even noticed it. However, I was living with my very abusive mother who essentially bribed me to lose weight (I won’t get into specifics but by ‘lose weight’ I don’t mean a healthy amount). With a combination of her encouragement and mental abuse, I lost… a lot of weight really fast. I went from being a bit overweight to quite underweight. This was mostly all from just not eating. I honestly don’t remember it — it’s a blur, but even though I was never weight-conscious before this, I felt quite good afterwards. I never thought anything of it despite a few concerned comments from those who knew me.

I maintained my middle school weight for a while, occasionally gaining some and losing some, but generally staying in the same range. Over a year ago, shortly after the initial quarantine, I gained all of that weight back and then some without even really noticing. But there was one day I suddenly became aware of the feeling of my thighs rubbing against each other… and this completely set me off. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It has consumed me.

Now I am obsessed with weight. It is always on my mind no matter what I’m doing. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone — I’ll compare myself to any random person on the street without being able to control my thoughts. I compare myself to my boyfriend and he’s significantly taller than me and a male, but I still do it. I can’t stop looking at photos of other people and old photos of myself. I can’t wear more than half of my clothes because they don’t fit in a very particular way. I don’t seem to have the restraint I did in middle school regarding food and I’ve been stuck in a miserable cycle of eating, despising myself for it and promising to stop, then caving in and eating again. I can’t stop obsessing over how appalling I feel in my own body and it’s made me extremely, extremely depressed and has become my number one preoccupation. This past year and a half has sent me into a downward spiral and after not losing weight due to my constant relapsing, I’ve started to abuse my ADHD medication.

I guess my question, as pathetic as it seems, is: could this be an eating disorder or am I just insecure?

I'll start by repeating that I cannot afford to see a doctor until I  have insurance (10/26). I am currently supporting myself and my fiancee  (disabled, absolutely cannot work) on $15/hr working full time at a  well-known big box store.

MtF transgender (technically fluid but further info here is  irrelevant), 4.5 consecutive years on HRT. weight fluctuates all over  the place, up or down around a third of my body weight in a matter of 3  months feels almost normal to me, lately. For the last month or slightly  longer, I've had an issue that has progressively worsened. I seem to be  unable to eat anything and keep the entire meal down. Maybe the first  two or three bites are fine, but even a sandwich is too much for me most  of the time. I don't feel particularly stressed, but I do feel like I'm  kind of fat, despite being largely a healthy weight for my frame, and  only looking overweight in my belly area. The thought of stepping on a  scale and seeing that I have lost weight, even a half pound, makes me  feel elated. I tell people I am fat when they mention food or clothing,  and they look at me like ""girl you crazy."" wanna weigh a number that I  know isn't a healthy number for myself.

I'm frankly, afraid to put food in myself and force it down only for  it to come up about 45 minutes later. I'd like to check into a rehab  clinic but I don't have the money nor the credit to do so, and I'll have  insurance in \~45 days. can't decide if I need to check in sooner or not. Fiancee's family isn't  far away but I hate the thought of asking to burden her parents like  that again while I get better. She rescued me from living on the streets  in mid 2020 and we quickly fell in love and got engaged. She's my  everything and I don't want to hurt her but I see myself doing it by not  being able to take care of myself.

I've struggled with food for a while. I was a chubby  kid, and I used to always wish I could just stop eating. I'd tell myself  I wouldn't eat, or I'd only eat one meal a day, but it never became a  consistent thing. There was a period of time a few months ago where I  was broke, I couldn't afford any food, so I stopped eating often.

I have read a lot about EDs trying to see what is  happening to me and I would come to a conclusion that in the past 3  years I suffered from bulimia, orthorexia, body dysmorphia, anorexia and  overeating. The main reason I developed it is because I started with a  strict gym regime where I lost a lot of weight. I tried to stay on that  weight (which now looking back was too low) and that’s where the problem  was. Also, my perception of food was (and still is) totally distorted.  It was then when I started purging the meals that I didn’t perceive as  “clean”. Later that developed into a full blown overeating and purging  period and I gained all the lost weight back plus more. I felt miserable  with myself for years. 

Recently, I lost the weight again in a very unhealthy way by mostly  starving myself, overtraining and purging. For the past month I’ve been  overeating most of the days, since I guess my body was starving and I  gained some of the weight back, as well as the feeling of misery. When I  do this, I buy all the “bad” food that I can find, come home and stuff  myself with it until I fall asleep or can’t breathe anymore. Then I fall  asleep and purge when I wake up. I rarely eat a proper healthy meal,  but I always tell myself that I will. Then I decide not to eat for a  whole day as a restriction and at one point I start starving and I buy  unhealthy food again. And that’s the circle I am in… 

My main problem is that I noticed how this is starting to seriously  effect other fields of my life. I am often depressed but right now  mostly numb to everything, I can’t remember when was the last time I was  happy and laughing, I avoid social events, I don’t eat with other  people, I get foggy brain and I feel cold when I starve myself, I can’t  sleep if I completely don’t stuff myself and my perception of myself is  based solely on how I look and with that also my mood. I only feel  satisfied with my body when I look like a undeveloped girl and it  bothers me when my breast start to show.  I really don’t want to go through those “miserable years” again and I  want to start with my recovery. I have been trying to figure out this by  myself, since seeking professional help is too expensive for me. I  haven’t told my parents or my friends, but they’ve noticed that I have  phases, either underweight or overweight, also I think this is a very  sensitive topic so nobody directly asked me anything and I always made  some kind of excuses for my unusual eating patterns.

Hi, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I’ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.

I’ve noticed one thing in particular that triggers me that I can’t  find info about is whenever I find out about someone who has experienced  addiction, I immediately want to open up to them but don’t, and instead  go into a tailspin of ideas and old habits.

Does this happen to anyone else? Does opening up to them help? I’m  wondering if this is a better approach for me. So many people don’t see  the connection between an eating disorder and, say, alcoholism, and I  would love not to get triggered by someone’s recovery journey even if  it’s not an eating disorder.

228,228,EatingDisorders,"I have struggled with eating since my mid teens, I am 22 (m) now. I’ve struggled with multiple eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, BED. For the greater part of my ED history, I have had the most difficulty with anorexia. At the moment I find myself cycling through all of them: very low cal diet as long as I can while exercising &gt; eventual failure persisted by binge eating leading to intense workouts from post binge guilt. Repeat. Throughout the years, it has never become a severe physical health risk, but I’m quite sure it contributed to the permanent digestive issues that I now have and am medicated for. On the other hand, it has been a never ending torment to my mental health. Within the past 2 years, it has consumed most of my day to day life.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been times where I’ve managed to maintain a healthy eating regimen, but it never lasts. Funnily enough, I feel the most in control when successfully maintaining an eating disorder; it evokes a rewarding feeling. The days in which I’m unsuccessful in my ED ambitions, I feel worthless and shameful. I’m constantly keeping track of certain dates to gauge how I should eat in the following weeks, or, pushing back/cancelling plans if I’m not yet satisfied with my self imposed eating boot camp, if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just really tired of it all. I’m tired of constantly postponing my happiness to some undetermined date that keeps moving further and further away until my body looks a certain way. My stomach sinks every time I realize my youth is passing me by while I wallow in self loathing. Most of all, I feel deep sadness at my inability to self love.

I've been in recovery for six years, but relapsed a few months ago. I've never been diagnosed or treated even though I had some pretty significant health impacts. I had three young children at the time, and was embarrassed of my eating disorder so I never sought help. I've managed pretty well until now. I honestly did not think I would ever be engaging in ED behaviors again, but after losing my mom last year, relationship issues, and my youngest having some pretty significant ongoing medical issues I started using it as a coping mechanism and it snowballed from there.

Every single part of me just wants this to quietly go away. The logical part of my brain is screaming at me. I'm in my 30's now, my oldest is 13 not 7, I feel like I've lost every reasonable part of me. I did this before on my own, but I'm really struggling right now. I don't think I want to give up my way of coping, but I recognize the damage I'm doing.

Anyways, we're back to the embarrassment/shame. I live in a small community, I have insurance but no primary physician because I've never been able to make an appointment for a checkup. I don't have a support network outside of the wonderful support system of therapists/teachers for my kiddos.

231,231,EatingDisorders,"Recently, I have been wondering if I have an eating disorder. Since  March, I lost a lot of weight without noticing, which started a spiral of working out and eating “right”.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat an average of xxx calories (very low) a day in one meal. Oftentimes much less, and a lot of times what I am taking in is from drinks, not food. I won’t touch soda or dessert at all, and I will obsessively monitor how many calories are in my food so I can decide how much of it I want to eat. Part of it is I’m only hungry for a little, but part of it is deliberate. I have panic attacks when I see how many calories are in restaurant dishes. I often order a small house salad and pick around the cheese and croutons and dress it in lemon juice and pepper or nothing at all. I absolutely will not eat if someone else is not, to the point of starving myself because my partner is not hungry, or whomever I’ve gone out to dinner with just wants to grab drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost even more weight, but it is considered overweight BMI apparently, so no doctor will believe that I have an eating disorder. I tried detailing how quickly I lost so much weight and my relationship with food, but since I’m overweight and actively dieting, doctors just keep telling me that’s the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don’t have a problem- maybe it’s all fine. Most of the people in my life brush off my concerns because “everyone feels that way when they’re dieting”. But I don’t think they do. And if they do, I don’t know why anyone would do it. I spend all day obsessing about what and how much I ate and punishing myself if I miss my workout (I hurt my knee really badly pushing myself to keep running after injured it, for one.) I’m miserable most of the time, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Even if I’m hungry.

I just moved to Korea where I'm gonna be living and working for 1 year+. I'd say I'm pretty much recovered these days but at the moment I'm finding it very difficult to eat properly/enough. In quarantine I lost a small amount of weight but I really can't afford to lose weight.

At home in the UK I was vegan - not for disordered reasons! There is loads of great vegan stuff available in the UK and I enjoyed eating all kinds of vegan junk food. But here in Korea everybody loves meat and fish, kbbq, fried chicken, bulgogi, etc. Even being vegetarian is barely a thing. Realistically don't think I can be fully vegan here cause there's so few options and I'm fairly picky, but the thought of breaking my ""moral code"" (sorry not trying to sound preachy just can't think of a better way to put it) upsets me. I've been vegan for 5 years, before that vegetarian for 3 so now I feel intensely guilty if I eat something non-vegan.

Also I'm finding it tough cause I'm living on my own for the first time in a few years and now that what I eat is totally up to me I find it quite overwhelming. Sometimes I end up skipping meals or only eating a snack because I just don't know what to have, or don't want to keep eating the same stuff over and over.

Anyway I'm not actively trying to restrict or anything just worried about slipping back into disordered habits. My being here is completely tied to my job so I really don't want to get sick and be forced to go back home. Sorry this was kind of rambly. I don't really know what I want from this, I guess just to vent but if anyone can empathise or has any suggestions I'd be so grateful.

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

I’m worried that this is going to send me back into the cycle of restrictive eating.

I don’t really know what’s going on with me. i have, for a very long time, have just been unable to eat. being near, smelling, even looking at food makes my stomach turn. i CAN eat, but it usually ends in discomfort and in the worst case, vomiting in the end. i’ve been to doctors who specialize in stomach issues and i’ve had tests done and there’s just nothing wrong with my stomach that the three different doctors i’ve gone to could find. but the pain is immense. what makes it all the more confusing for me is the fact that i have absolutely no body issues. i love my body. i treat my body the best i can. however, not being able to eat has taken a toll on my body. i have breathing problems and get winded very easily which started when the inability to eat began to get worse in 2019. i eat less than a meal a day right now and i feel sick very often. i get very cold to the point where i uncontrollably shiver and i sleep with a heating pad and typically in full winter pajamas and socks. even then, i find myself waking up freezing and sick. no liver, kidney, or gull blatter issues, they even put a little camera down into my stomach and found nothing! i don’t know if this really classifies as an eating disorder, but i do strongly believe my lack of food is a causing factor in the other problems. i can’t just “force myself to eat” because when i do, i typically end up losing the food that i’ve gained. i’ve even talked to my psychiatrist and therapist about it, as well as the staff in the psychiatric ward. this was when the additional problems were really coming into affect, and they said that they didn’t believe it was an eating disorder because it was unwilling and not forced. i just need advice to make my life easier. i’m in constant pain and can barely lift over 30 pounds anymore. i have a hard time working and sometimes even driving because of the pain. i’m lost and scared.",,Request: I've been unable to eat,1,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pe5ka5,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5ka5/request_ive_been_unable_to_eat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5ka5/request_ive_been_unable_to_eat/,1630277114,363,0,0,0,-1,1,Inability to eat due to physical discomfort,harmful,"Experiencing immense pain and discomfort when attempting to eat, Breathing problems and feeling cold due to lack of nutrition, Difficulty working and doing daily activities due to pain and discomfort",Inability to eat due to physical discomfort,harmful,"Experiencing immense pain and discomfort when trying to eat, Breathing problems and getting winded easily, Eating less than a meal a day and feeling sick often, Feeling cold and shivering uncontrollably, Difficulty working and driving due to pain",Inability to eat due to stomach discomfort and pain,harmful,"Experiences discomfort and pain when attempting to eat, Suffers from breathing problems and gets winded easily, Eats less than a meal a day and feels sick often, Experiences uncontrollable shivering and feels cold frequently, Unable to force themselves to eat and typically loses the food when they do, Has sought help from multiple medical professionals and mental health providers"

I've long been suffering from a restrictive ED. I've been told by multiple professionals and resources that the only way for me to recover from my ED is first and foremost to 'stop restricting'. However, no one ever explained to me what that means in practice.

Because to me, right now, 'stop restricting' means just binging. There is NO amount, type or combination of food that ever satisfies me to the fullest extent. I always want to eat more. So anything other than ""eat forever"" is actually restriction.

I'm being followed by a therapist AND a dietitian but both of them no longer really know what to do with me because I'm never getting better and if anything I'm regressing. That's because on one hand the dietitian prescribed me a meal plan which, however balanced and carefully crafted it is, still feels like restriction to me - I have to eat 'normal portions' at certain times etc. - and on the other hand the therapist's been doing mental work with me that has been incredibly helpful to let me understand so many things about me and my personality and has made me progress so much in several aspects of my life, but has changed absolutely NOTHING about my ED behaviours.

Basically I follow this supposedly balanced, abundant and adequate meal plan for a while, maybe I gain some weight, but the meals never satisfy me and it feels like I'm restricting all the time, waiting for the next meal to come, always obsessing about food etc., so at some point I ditch the meal plan because if I have to restrict then I wanna do it on my own terms. So then after a while I just get fed up and I'm so ravenous that I actually do decide to 'stop restricting', so then I end up eating all the time and binge on thousands of calories, which then I promptly purge because I cannot stand the weight gain....blah blah blah, it's a very known common cycle.

I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to restrict my whole life because I cannot fathom ever being satisfied by a 'normal meal' ever again, yet I can't just binge my face off every single day. I'm not even underweight anymore like I used to so maybe I'm just broken. But the point is, all these people that say 'stop restricting' seem to actually mean 'stop restricting *below a normal amount of food*', they don't ACTUALLY mean 'stop restricting for real' and it's so frustrating.",,Request: How can I 'stop restricting' without starting binging?,9,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pe5hd1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,1630276842,430,0,0,0,-1,1,"Restrictive eating disorder, prescribed meal plan that feels like restriction",harmful,"The individual feels lost and frustrated because they don't know how to ""stop restricting"" without feeling like they are either binging or still restricting, Therapist has been helpful with mental work but has not changed the individual's eating disorder behaviors","Being told to ""stop restricting"" without clear guidance or explanation of what that means in practice",harmful,"Feeling lost and unsure of how to recover from restrictive eating disorder, Struggling to follow a meal plan that feels like restriction and constantly obsessing about food, Cycling between restriction and bingeing/purging","Following a meal plan that feels like restriction, struggling to understand what ""stop restricting"" means in practice",harmful,"Feeling lost and unsure of how to recover from their restrictive eating disorder, Experiencing a cycle of bingeing and purging due to feeling unsatisfied by meals, Feeling frustrated by the lack of clarity around what ""stop restricting"" means"

Last year, I blamed my weight loss on going to college and not liking the food provided, but this summer I have been home with good food at my disposal and I think I almost eat less. I feel like I’m not doing it on purpose, or that I have a good reason, I’m just not interested or don’t think about it. I am also noticeably getting full faster. I’m sure this is negatively affecting my health but I don’t know how to fix it. Plus, I’m about to move back on campus and I’m afraid I will continue getting progressively worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And it’s not like I don’t get hungry. Like both today and yesterday, I got hungry but I just didn’t eat. I ate one meal throughout the entire day and just ignored my hunger. Why would I do that?

Despite not being medically diagnosed I know for a fact I suffer from some form of an eating disorder. I constantly do body checks, check my weight every morning and every night, and I'm scared to eat fast food for breakfast and lunch and skip breakfast while constantly feeling guilty for eating lunch when i can skip it so easily. Because of this, my mental health was been deteriorating FAST. I've become more moody and distanced with my family. I'm always fine and happy at school but the moment I go home my mood is instantly ruined. I also recently started cutting myself as well. I rarely ever did it beforehand but I'm doing it so much now. I want to get help, I really do but I'm scared. I don't want to see them get heart broken.

I have struggled with eating for as long as I can remember. I remember trying to hide breakfast in the couch when I was a child, or crying over a bowl of spaghettios in elementary school because I was afraid to eat it. Now, I am almost 25 and it is getting bad again. I go through periods in my life where I'm kind of okay and then I always end up spiraling back to my fear. Sometimes I'm okay to eat, but then directly after I eat I go into a full blown panic attack. Things like putting peppermint oil on my arms, or chewing peppermint gum, or drinking sparkling water after a meal have helped me stay level headed but it is not always working as it did before. Sometimes, I can't finish a meal because the panic attack starts during a meal. I need help and I dont know what to do. This is ruining my life and I feel like a prisoner in my own body.

272,272,EatingDisorders,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a transgender woman. I'm 24, 5'7 and my weight has always been considered ""normal"" for BMI male standards and whatnot. In fact, my BMI still counts as normal. Basically, I never had any problems with being under/overweight but I always counted calories and felt bad about eating, especially when I binged a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been severely restricting my meals lately. I still eat every 4 to 5 hours because of gastritis (severe heartburn if I fast too often), but I'm still hungry 24/7. I used to do intermittent fasting and I loved doing that, but had to stop. Also I have been doing cardio everyday, not as a ""cheat way"" to eat more, but because I just want to speed up the process. Very low cal and cardio have nuked my weight in the last month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is that I absolutely hate not only my body, but also any sort of fat in me, especially the belly area. To me, I just think I'm in a super strict diet and took some inspiration from pro-anorexia communities. And probably because of this, I developed some very bad habits such as weighing multiple times a day and basically I just got addicted to seeing the numbers go down every single day. I know I know, just being in a community like this is wrong, but still.

Obviously I don't want to develop an ED, but I do plan on staying like this for a while until I think I'm skinny enough. My parents won't stop saying that I look too skinny already, and sometimes I lie to them about having eaten when in reality I didn't. Some of my friends also told me they are worried because of my appearance. One of them even suggested I could have anorexia, and at that time I was eating normally. I thought she was completely overreacting, but now I'm reconsidering that because of my current habits and goals. I just cannot see anything wrong with it, because I'm still very far from my goal, and it feels like they are all picking on me because they don't want me to be skinny for whatever reason. Sometimes I also have nightmares regarding binge eating. And last but not least, maybe I'm just doing this for attention? Tho I really only told about this to a single friend who wasn't very judgmental. Like with the same argument people use for self-harmers, which... is also something I did. I also used to starve sometimes for self-harm purposes, but I can't do it right now due to the mentioned gastritis, but I would if I could, so I had to switch my method.",,"Request: Is something wrong with me?

274,274,EatingDisorders,"Hi all, I’m a 20 year old with ADHD and ASD. Just thought I’d ask for advice because my behavior recently has become kinda concerning, but I’m not really sure who to talk to or what it is exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, over the past week or so, I’ve been dehydrating myself—which is something I’ve done before, but usually I can talk myself out of it before it gets this bad. It’s been taking over my life and making it difficult for me to do anything else, as well as affecting me physically by making me very constipated (sorry for TMI), but for whatever reason I can’t stop. I don’t know how long this is going to last, and I’m worried I might eventually stop drinking water altogether and land myself in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve mostly been eating food like normal, though. The few times I skipped meals, it was because I was worried eating would make me thirsty and I’d end up drinking water, and I hated the thought of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay with my weight and body shape, so I know this isn’t related to a body image issue. Honestly, I think it’s just a really shitty grab for control. For whatever reason, I experience a lot of anxiety around peeing (I’m sorry, I know that doesn’t make sense but I just do lmao), and dehydrating limits my bathroom trips which is nice and also kinda why I started in the first place lmao. The problem is I know this could damage my body if I continue, but I can’t stop.

I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I didn’t know where else to ask. Could this be an ED, but somehow only with water/liquids and not food???

I’m kind of at a loss here and I’d appreciate if anyone else has any input.

Other the past few months, the obsession with food returned. I'd been dieting healthily for about a year and I was finally seeing results. One day, I drove out to the closest McDonald's as a quick snack before I headed home after work and ordered a cheeseburger... Something I haven't eaten in years.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

when it comes to the choice of food, i think i have an addiction to spending money on takeout or delivery rather than making something healthier at home. i can’t control the urges to pick up my phone and order something (often in bigger amounts than i need), and feel disgusted and angry at myself for doing that after i’ve eaten. the cycle repeats itself from there, so i’d go through eating a lot —&gt; not eating to punish myself.

295,295,EatingDisorders,"I have unhealthy body image issues, but only when I'm underweight. I would love to know if anyone can relate. I used to have some disordered eating patterns in my late teens (I'm currently 24). I've always been on the lower end of the healthy BMI range. I do fluctuate a bit, like most people do, but I'm usually comfortable in my body no matter what shape it's in. I don't really feel the need or desire to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I do happen to lose weight, as I recently unintentionally did, it sometimes triggers something in me. Whenever I reach or cross the threshold of being underweight, I become hyper-aware of my body. I look at the signs of being a tad too skinny (very visible collarbones, sternum slightly poking through, etc.). I don't think it's particularly attractive, but I'm not repulsed by it either; instead it's almost like I'm fascinated by it. Body-image wise, I know that if I were to gain the weight back and be within my typical range, I would feel perfectly fine, and I wouldn't think about it anymore - I'd be back to normal. I'd be happy to get some volume back in my chest, in fact. It's not even that big of difference in my weight or how my body looks, but just knowing I'm under the normal range is what triggers me. A part of me wants to stay this way. I think I like the idea of being ""tiny"", and maybe even of people expressing concern for me. I hate that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

And I hate that I wasn't even actively trying to lose it, but now that I have, I need to be careful. The few times I noticed this in the past, I got out of it pretty easily. I have no issues with food anymore, and eat rather intuitively. But over the last few months, due to depression and medication, my appetite and interest in food are lower, so it's easier to think that my weight loss is ""inevitable"", and harder to get back to normal. I'm not restricting myself, but I'm also not putting in the effort to eat more.

&amp;#x200B;

It got better over the years, then worse, then better again. I’ve never truly “recovered”, just very high highs and very low lows. I spent my sophomore year starving myself, then my junior year is when I started purging.

&amp;#x200B;

It got so bad that I was vomiting blood and knew i needed to get help, but I couldn’t bring myself to confess why. My mother just thought I was very sick. Went to a gastroenterologist, got put on a few medications, I even ended up getting a damn endoscopy / colonoscopy. The whole time I knew that this was all for nothing and the guilt only fueled my disorder. At some point, the purging turned into another form of self harm.

&amp;#x200B;

I got better after that, and I’d been better for the past two years, but it’s back. It’s back and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t eat anything without purging. Even if I plan on keeping food down, I panic and purge. The past two days I just haven’t eaten because I don’t want to purge.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m exhausted, I’m dizzy, my body is so heavy. I feel like I’m shutting down. I’m going to try eating some oatmeal after I write this.

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s my question- How do I express to my family (specificity my mom) that I likely need inpatient treatment for my bulimia, when I’ve kept my ED hidden for the past seven years? I’m worried that it’ll kill me before I even admit I have a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**

&amp;#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&amp;#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals.

308,308,EatingDisorders,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

So, first of all, I am 16 and male (trans). My weight is normal.

Ever since I was little, I would feel really uncomfortable with the thought of being overweight or overeating, to the point where I would cry because the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone. They'd come when I was around food, so in ""normal"" circumstances, or at completely random times. Sometimes I'd imagine people I know overeating/being overfed, and gaining a lot of weight - not on purpose, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I have this same problem. I'm still getting sick from these thoughts and I generally avoid eating too much for that same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started puberty, I also started gaining weight, which is normal, but I hated it. I loathed having fat rolls here and there, or a small double chin, or a stomach that wasn't unrealistically flat. Fot that reason, I started restricting my eating habits around two years ago. Skipping full meals doesn't work when I'm at home, so I just do that when I'm not - which is about once a week. I then skip lunch entirely and only eat a small dinner. Other than that, I try not to eat unhealthy snacks. I often realise how much I've eaten on a day and I then get angry at myself and start crying again. Reading about calories just makes me feel bad over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love cooking and baking, and during lockdown I used to bake a lot, but I rarely ever ate what I made, out of fear. Outside of that, I mostly stayed at home during that time, so I was even more concerned with my own weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried to work out. I'm sadly not a very disciplined person, so I rarely ever actually work out, but I really hate myself for this every night. My weight and the way my body looks just makes me cry and I am trying my best to change this.

Several years ago my stepdaughter was admitted to the hospital almost in a coma because her mom had starved her over time. From what I gather, the mother was convinced they should only eat organic/non-gmo (which isn’t a bad thing ofc), but there are a lot of holes in the story. For one, the mom was underweight but relatively healthy. My stepdaughter weighed half what would have been appropriate.

Now she’s better, in terms of getting enough calories. Shes still in a skilled nursing facility because, while she’s out of the woods, her mom has bred distrust and apathy. The thinking is sort of ‘why bother doing for myself because I just always hurt and everyone is mad at me and I’ll just try to be very small so as not to bother…’ It’s problematic, but my goals are to bolster self esteem and confidence.

Anyway she’s at goal weight but someone suggested her skewed view of food and eating might mean she has an eating disorder(?)

This is new for me but I think counseling would help. I’m encouraging her to talk to someone (she has access but no desire). Beyond that, though, I’d like to find out what small things I can do to assist.

Is this an ED? Could her constant pain be a lasting effect? What other lasting effects could this have caused?

Does anyone know of any books or theories that may be helpful? Or if anyone has gone through this sort of Munchausen(by proxy)-esque forced/complicit starvation..?

I’m not really sure where to start, besides just being super patient and encouraging. I feel like I could do more to support her recovery.

When  I was 16 I obsessed with my weight and weighed myself multiple times a  day. If the number changed even a little I was immediately restricting  my already extremely restricted diet. My parents would always serve me  up a smaller portion of food compared to my brothers. I barely ate and  if I gained any weight my Mum would comment on me getting chubby, and  grab any belly fat that I had. For reference I was about 5'8 at the time  and weighed xx kgs (normal range). I thought I was fat. When my parents weren't looking  I would sneak into the pantry and binge on any and all 'bad' food I  could. I would eat the baking chocolate, biscuits, museli bars,  everything. My parents kept bells on their snack cupboard so we couldn't  help ourselves, it'd been this way since we were little and continued  until we moved out.  I eventually got a job in a supermarket and had  ready access to foods I wasn't 'allowed because they'd make me fat' so I  started bingeing at work, buying copious amounts of food at work and  stuffing my face on my breaks. I'd come home and hide food in my room.  This lead to massive weight gain and more and more comments my weight  and appearance. I thought I looked disgusting but couldn't stop.  Eventually things balanced out and I lost a lot of the extra weight  through reducing sugar and healthy eating along with exercise. But I  still saw myself as fat. Still couldn't see that I'd changed my body. 

Since then, I have a horrible relationship with my body and with  food. I struggle with body dysmorphia on the daily. Some days seeing  myself as so huge and disgusting I want to never look at myself again,  and others viewing myself as 'normal' but then not fitting into my  clothes size as they're suddenly too small. And so the cycle goes, round  and around. 

I hide food constantly, sneak snacks, binge on foods like I'll never  have it again, then buy more. I feel so ashamed tucking away bags of  m&amp;Ms or bars of chocolate but can't help it, I crave the sugar and  snacks and can't stop myself. 

I have had a baby, 11mo, and my body has changed again. Breastfeeding  has me starving 80% of the time and often I get so hungry there doesn't  feel like any time at all to make food so I reach for what is ready  available- which often means things that are higher in calories and  sugar. I am huge, the biggest I've ever been on the scale. I'm obsessed,  and most of the time hate the way I look. Each time I see a photo of  myself or see my reflection, all I see is the fat, the chin, my  stomach... I adore my stretch marks because they're a sign of my baby,  permanently carved into my body, but the weight that goes along with  it... I hide my body under baggy clothes... I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the energy to work out, I'm dealing with a broken bone  that is still causing pain 5 months later... Pain all over my body...

My b/p has gotten absolutely out of control lately  and I'm scared to DEATH. I've been struggling with occasional purging  for a few years now but my main problem used to be restriction and until  the last couple months I had never purged this much this frequently.  I'm already feeling the physical effects, my mouth is sore, my teeth  feel sensitive and my stomach burns.

I really really need to stop asap. But I know that if I stop purging I  will just keep binging and the mere thought of weight gain completely  terrifies me. I've tried keeping a binge down but the feeling of dread  and sheer panic over weight gain was completely unbearable so I only  lasted less than an hour before rushing to the toilet.

The fact is, I'm no longer underweight so I feel like I have no  ""room"" to binge anymore, which only worsens the anxiety around binges.

I've tried everything. I have a therapist who no longer knows what to  do with me because I never improve. I have a meal plan and it's not  helping. I try following it and eating ""balanced meals"" and they never  satisfy me so in the end I binge anyway. I don't understand the concept  of ""stop restricting"" because for me it just means binging (and  generally eating ALL THE FOOD). I'm not underweight and I'm only a few  lbs below my pre-ED weight so that cannot make much of a difference.  With my therapist I've even tried to journal to detect if my binges are  associated to any emotional patterns but we couldn't find any. I binge  when I'm happy and when I'm sad, I binge when I have a lot of feelings  to process and when everything's quiet, I binge when I'm busy and when  I'm not busy, I binge when I have lunch and when I don't. And then  obviously I purge every single time because I can't stand the weight  gain.

I'm constantly hungry, constantly scared and nervous and don't know  what to do anymore. I feel completely desperate and hopeless.

I have dealt with an eating disorder as a form of self harm  (restricting and purging) for about two years. It was mostly unrelated  to weight as I was already underweight when it started. As time went on I  punished myself for being so underweight that I would continue to  starve myself. I've been recoved for about two years and have no real  triggers and I don't see myself at risk of relapse. That's not what this  is about, just background.

My boyfriend of a year now confessed to me in June that he believes  he has an eating disorder. His family has mocked his weight since he was  8 years old, forced him to go onto diets, etc. He still lives at home  and is constantly mocked for his weight and compared to his siblings.  But what baffles me is that he is not overweight. He would still be  perfect in my eyes if he was, I just don't understand where the comments  are coming from. I suppose he could be described as chubby but I  absolutely couldn't see him as overweight to any extreme amount. He has a  very distorted self image due to a lifetime of being mocked and shamed  by his family.

In June he told me that a few months before he'd started using a  calorie tracking app and it had spiraled out of control. He often eats  twice a day, at dinner and whatever he can find after midnight. It's  very obviously not enough as he's constantly feeling sick, bruising  easily, having memory issues and is exhausted most of the day. He's also  very depressed a lot of the time, sleeping about 14 hours a day,  isolating himself at times, etc. It hurts to watch him struggle and know  that there isn't anything I can really do. If he was anyone else I  would tell someone close to him that could help him, but I worry the  people he stays with would even encourage it.

He's self aware, knows it's harmful and says he just doesn't know how  to break the pattern. I offer advice (from my own experience and things  I read online) and support, compliment him on things unrelated to his  appearance unless comments on his body are welcomed.

Hi, I'm depressed and have been Having trouble with food which have caused me to lose quite a bit of weight.

I am never alone, and have come to the realisation that anyone even  being in the house deters me from eating. I have not eaten for more than  a week. I don't feel like I can ask my roommate to leave the house for  several hours, just so I might eat. I am a very slow eater, most likely  due to IBS, and a simple meal might take me an hour to consume. 

I have previously been a foodie, and always loved baking and cooking  so this is quite upsetting. I can't even get myself to use utensils, or  have anything that might smell and bother others. 

Anyone have any suggestions on how to be okay with others being near when you eat/ know that you are eating?

I struggled with binge eating disorder and bulimia  for years and it’s starting to reach a head. I’ve told myself I would  never resort back to bulimia after I nearly choked on my own vomit, but  I’ve been binging a lot lately and it’s made me feel very worthless.  Since I was young I dealt with a lot of abuse and stress and food was my  only way to cope. I eventually found more productive activities like  drawing, writing, and skateboarding, but lately I’ve resorted back to  binge eating. It’s taking a huge hit to my self esteem and it feels like  an inescapable hole. I eat because I’m depressed, then I’m depressed  because I eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have an ED or am I just an attention seeking drama queen?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for a few months now and started taking medications mid July because therapy alone wasn't helping. (So far the medication doesn't seem to be working)

&amp;#x200B;

Since somewhere around the beginning of June (I think). I started losing my appetite and interest in food. This started getting worse and worse. It went from eating a bit less to eating a lot less to where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to eat anymore. I have no appetite and absolutely no interest in food or eating. Thinking about food makes me want to cry (I don't know why). When I do eat, it's very little. I also keep track of all the calories I consume and weigh myself everyday. I've lost about 37 pounds since mid June I think, but I was slightly overweight so I'm really happy with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is all my own fault because I keep telling myself I can't eat, that I have to lose weight and that I'm too fat. I feel like I'm an imposter. Maybe I'm just too lazy to cook, to go shopping, to eat? Maybe I'm not depressed and just incredibly lazy. I don't work out or do any kind of sport really. I sit or lie down a lot... Maybe I'm an attention seeker? Even posting this here feels like I'm looking for attention... But I just feel so hopeless.

I am a very picky eater, a word that I hate to use due to often being infantilized or used to refer to children despite being an adult with what seems to be a very serious issue. I have researched and while there seems to be an ED which may fit what i'm experiencing, my situation is not that extreme as the symptoms described in that ED, at least I don't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have what seems to be severe depression and body issues, I am not diagnosed hence it's not clear to me. I hate most food, be it taste or texture, and refuse to eat it no matter what. I can cook very little because I have no experience and am afraid to learn how to cook due to my living situation (unrelated). Since the pandemic I have gained weight, and cannot afford much take-out food if it's not cheap, which usually ends up being fast food. I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how I look, I always feel fat, and saying I hate myself is an understatement. Yet when I think it's all mostly because I am a ""picky eater"" it makes me feel disgusted. I feel like a child. I feel massive anxiety around food if it's not something simple like rice, plain pasta, or other basic foods like that. I cannot tolerate seafood, nor most greens. Seeing any spices on my food makes me spiral because I won't know what it is and the thought of it changing the taste or texture of the food disgusts me. It makes me feel rude whenever I order out and it makes me feel like I'm wasting food if someone else is cooking for me, and in both cases it feels like im wasting money, and it would be easier for me to shut up and starve. Growing up I was always judged and picked on, punished and shouted at for not eating certain foods.

ED or not. Trigger warning: vomit, eating disorder. So, I’m 20 years of age and for the last 18 months I’ve been dealing with loss of appetite. I’ve been “slim” “skinny” my whole life so food has never been an issue for me. But last year I gained a bit of weight, it went to face and i hated it. I don’t remember exactly how or what happened after but I was back to my old weight again and i was happy. I didn’t think anything of it but now my psychologist is concerned that i may have ED. Im going days without food, living only on a mini sausage roll. Sometimes I wonder how I’m able to go to work.

I was so hungry but every time I put food in my mouth I would feel sick to my stomach. I love food and I thought it was just stress but it comes and goes, that undesirable feeling to eat. I want to eat but every time I do there’s this voice in my head double checking if I’m enjoying the food, double checking if I’m sure I don’t want to vomit. And then I run to the toilet.

I was fairly large, (an uncomfortable amount). I spent years bringing my weight down by eating pretty healthy but mainly daily exercise comprised of cross trainer, a 5k run and a couple of floor exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

For years I've hovered around my goal weight of *omitted* weighing nearly every day. Maybe I'd have a takeaway on the weekend and go up a few pounds but a night of eating healthy and it would go down again.. Until now..

&amp;#x200B;

My weight is inexplicably starting sit about 6 pounds higher which feels like a massive difference in my body. I physically feel a little more weighty and I think I can see it in my face and body.

336,336,EatingDisorders,"So like the title suggests i am wondering if I have developed an Ed over the past couple of months or if I just think I have because even though a lot of my behaviours are questionable I still can’t fully believe it.If I have one I also want to find out what type I might have so I listed some of my behaviours below.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with food has always been normal before,I’ve always been skinny and everyone else in my family is too so I never felt like I needed to worry about food or what I ate since I never gained anything anyways.Around January I started feeling like I wasn’t skinny enough yet and like I could lose a small amount of weight to be at this specific goal weight which I was obsessed with for no real [reason.It](https://reason.It) started small with me just cutting out snacks but over the past couple of months it has spiraled into:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Counting calories/weighing everything I eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-Doing 2-3 workouts a day and feeling fat/like iam gaining weight when I skip a day

&amp;#x200B;

\-intermittent fasting,having specific times for when I can eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-binge episodes

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have tried purging a couple of times but it didn’t work so I use lax tea after I binge/feel like I ate too much

&amp;#x200B;

\-cutting food in small pieces,eating out of small plates while using small utensils to make the food last longer -feeling extra safe when eating a lot of fruit and vegetables

&amp;#x200B;

\-getting angry/upset/scared when someone forces me to eat something I don’t want to eat or didn’t plan on eating/I have to eat at a family event and don’t know what’s in the food,iam hanging out with friends and seeing them get my trigger foods (fear of losing control and binging on said foods)

&amp;#x200B;

\-having a specific calorie limit and feeling terrible and like iam going to gain weight if I get over that limit -being scared of weighing myself -Having meals planned out in my head -when something bad happens I automatically think about starving myself

&amp;#x200B;

I only weighed myself this month because I had to before my wisdom teeth removal surgery and turns out iam underweight now which makes me oddly proud but at the same time I still can’t believe it because I feel like I don’t look that different and because nobody has told me I look skinnier yet (could be because I’ve always been skinny already but it still upsets me)I feel like I maybe have to loose a bit more because for some reason I really want people to tell me that they see a difference or even that I look unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem I'm not sure how to handle. My friend has gained a lot of weight during the COVID-19 situation and wants to lose weight because they're overweight now and don't feel happy about the way they look. That's okay of course, but their attitude towards eating, losing weight and their self image lately has been worrying to me. They obsess over their intake and they're very insecure about their body. We both think they're going through a bad period mental health wise and they're projecting it on losing weight. Yesterday, they felt bad about something else and also felt like they had to much to eat, so they purged. This scared me shitless. They say they regret it and don't want to do it again and that they know where their behavior stems from, but I said that's what a lot of people think and say before developing an eating disorder. I recognize a lot of red flags in their behavior and I really want to help them and prevent the development of an eating disorder. What's something I could do to help push them in the right direction?

I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK and from my early teenage years to late teenage years I suffered with a restrictive ED and was consistently very underweight. Through a series of significant events including a loved one becoming very ill, a death, meeting my partner and quitting smoking &amp; drugs my ED seemed to no longer be an issue in the latter half of 2019 and I gained a little bit of weight to put me on the lower end of a healthy weight . I wasn’t thrilled but it didn’t bother me like I know it would have before, anyway, 2020 was a shitshow of course with the lockdowns, I got put on Citalopram then sertraline and by early 2021 I entered the lower end of overweight. I wasn’t thrilled at this but the meds allowed me to not care. 

Fast forward to April 2021, im off the meds and suddenly it all hits me. I decided I wanted to lose it in a healthy way so fast forward to now, I’m back to the lower end of a healthy weight. Things should be great right ? Well not so much. As I wanted to get back to my pre-lockdown weight as fast as possible I’ve had a v strict routine, but I still felt like I was being healthy as it wasn’t as restrictive as when I was a teenager, however now it’s time to relax, eat more and just maintain my weight im finding it impossible. For the first time in 3 months I tried to eat food that wasn’t super plain or healthy and would make me exceed my daily allowance and I didn’t sleep and I stayed up all night panicking from the shame, im so anxious about the scale going up as I’ve been weighing myself everyday the past 3 months. I’m glad im back to a healthy weight but trying to now not eat in a deficit is triggering me like crazy, i also am not thrilled about the physical results, 3 months ago I couldn’t look in the mirror, I can look now which is an improvement but I’m not satisfied still, I look like how I looked before lockdown which was the goal originally but I don’t feel able to stop, i thought I just had a good discipline this past months and was motivated to be healthy but now I’m wondering if my old behaviours are creeping back .

347,347,EatingDisorders,"I just got put on an exchange meal plan by my dietician and I feel like trying to attempt recovery while still having to follow rigid food rules is so counterintuitive and requires me to spend just as much time thinking &amp; obsessing about food and limiting my food choices as restricting did. Like I am still having to measure my food and weigh my proteins, I have to essentially count macros to meet my exchange goals for every meal, I have to plan out everything in advance instead of just eating what feels/sounds good.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten.

I've gone from being a lifelong titless wonder to now having breasts. They're not massive, but they're there. I used to be a ""no cup"" but now I fill an A-cup. Might even get away with a B cup.

&amp;#x200B;

Wont mention weight for obvious reasons, but I haven't been medically underweight since 2015/2016 and am now ""on the slim side of normal"". I've been heavier than this and still flat-chested, so I don't think it's simple weight gain. Late developer, I guess!

It might sound like a stupid thing for a woman to be upset about and I'm still only a damn A-cup, but this has really shaken my sense of self. I just feel very strange these days and I can't get used to my new shape. Little things like not being able to go out without a bra, clothes looking different on me, ""bouncing"" when I exercise or run upstairs, etc. It's bringing back dark thoughts I used to have as a teenager of wanting to not take up space.

352,352,EatingDisorders," I developed anorexia at about 15 during a volatile period in my life. I went from being overweight to underweight in about 5 months. It started out with healthy weight loss but slowly devolved into anorexia. After being forced into recovery from my family, I began to gain weight. And that is all that I have done for the past 6 years. For many years I didn't acknowledge the fact that I just traded one extreme for the other. I remember being told by my therapist that I wouldn't become overweight again during recovery, the thing that I was most scared of, and he was right. I am not overweight, I am obese. It is so hard for people to understand what I am going through. It is like I still have that ravenous hunger that was supposedly only going to last for a while.

Hi everyone, looking for advice on how to avoid slipping backwards and being triggered by weight loss/gain. I had a fall a couple of months ago, and was severely concussed, i was also prescribed a new medication for epilepsy that can be an appetite suppressant. Whatever the reason, I lost my appetite completely and barely ate. I was not previously overweight, but on the high side of normal for my height, and lost weight to the point where I am now on the low side of normal. When I was in my teens my eating was quite disordered, I would purposefully skip meals and make myself sick, was obsessed with numbers and Convinced I was overweight, would binge eat or purposely eat junk food because I knew exactly how many calories were in things (e.g eating 2 kitkats all day because in my head it was better than eating an actual meal since I knew the numbers). Anyway I consider myself to have recovered quite well from this over the past 10 years, don’t own a scales now and basically until this accident, was fairly unrestricted (I only know my weight because they took it in hospital when I fell, and I went to the doctors today). However, having lost weight, I feel once again obsessed with losing weight. I haven’t felt this feeling for years, it feels like I got a buzz from losing weight and thinking I was going to be eating tiny amounts and losing more and more weight forever. I feel overwhelmed by eating normally again and depressed at the idea of gaining the weight back. People have been commenting that I don’t look good, but I love the feeling of my clothes being too big. I have a normal appetite but have been telling people I don’t and feeling guilty when I do eat normal amounts. I ate a normal breakfast this morning (cornflakes and a fruit salad, defo not binging) and made myself sick after. I’m feeling stressed and low about my epilepsy diagnosis and having bad headaches, and I’m scared I’m vulnerable to this getting a lot worse. Please help.

359,359,EatingDisorders,"Hello, I'm absolutely desperate right now and I have no idea what to do and if anything can help me. I'm 24M from the UK, and I've been a long time sufferer of anxiety. Throughout most of my life, I've been able to control it, but about 5 years ago, it came back in full force and completely devastated me. I went from studying and uni to never leaving my home and, sometimes even my room, and feeling completely anxious all of the time. After a few years, I managed to get it under control to a certain extent. I still wasn't leaving the house much, but I had routine and functioned at a basic level. Last year was probably the best year I've had recently. I started going out more. My life wasn't free from anxiety, but I felt its control waning and I could finally see a future for myself. This all ended a few months ago when seemingly out of nowhere, it came back again. At first is was a panic attack here, a panic attack there, but as the weeks and months progressed, a chipped away at me. I tried to fight it. I tried to maintain my progress that I'd worked so hard to obtain, but it was futile. I withdrew more and more, slowly limiting my life more and more, and now I'm in the worst state I've ever been in.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my anxiety told hold fully 5 years ago, I've had a difficult relationship with food. My anxiety destroys my appetite and makes me feel incredibly nauseous (it almost feels like someone is sticking their fingers down my throat), but for the most part, I've managed to push through it, but now I can't even do that. I feel so bad almost all day. Constant nausea and anxiety. I feel completely detached from reality. Nothing feels real, so it feels impossible to ground myself in anything. I can't feel present because I don't know where I am. I feel like I'm stuck in a dream/nightmare state and I can't wake up. I know I need to eat and this just makes me more anxious and nauseous. I am really scared that I'm going insane and it's killing/going to kill me. Yesterday, I managed a banana, some peanuts, a small bowl of salad, a slice of bread and a cheese sandwich. Today, I've only managed a banana and a handful of nuts. This is about what I managed the other day when I had a really bad episode of hypoglycaemia, where I almost passed out. It felt like my insides were collapsing and is the worst I've ever felt in my life, and I'm still shaken by it and terrified of it happening again. The less I eat, the worse I feel, and the worse I feel, the less I eat. It feels endless. To make things even worse, we're experiencing a heatwave at the moment and I also have an ulcer on my uvula, which developed about a week ago, so eating has just felt like a herculean feat. It's painful and incredibly distressing, and it occupies my thoughts almost constantly. I've shrugged off labelling my eating problems as an eating disorder, as it's not associated with body image problems etc., but my eating and relationship with food is very disorder, so would it count?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not just food, but washing and brushing my teeth etc. has become a real challenge. My nausea is so bad that I can't physically talk to anyone either, as doing so makes me feel like I'm going to gag. I feel utterly trapped and know I need help, but I don't know what to do. I already take mirtazapine 30mg at night, which sometimes helps my appetite, and I was prescribed 2mg of Diazepam, which I've taken twice recently. It seemed to help a bit, but I'm terrified of the long term problems associated with it. Sorry for this barely coherent essay, but I'm completely lost right now.

362,362,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone! I got diagnosed with non-bulimic Purging Disorder last year, and at that time I was only purging a few  times per week. I felt like I had things under control in all honesty, however something that I was still struggling with is the fact that I was not losing weight, at all because of the medication I am on. I find that this has led to me being extremely restrictive and when I do eat, I purge any meal I have nowadays. Given this, I am *still* overweight given my height.

I have tried to recover in the past (before I got to the point of struggling daily with this) by developing eating schedules, eating with others, eating in moderation but ultimately my anxiety about my weight and self-destructive body image returns me to the same spot.

I honestly do not know where to go from here. I feel like ED recovery is a mountain that I do not know how to climb up. I am also starting to get scared as I do not want this to be permanent and I am starting to have physical health problems because of it. My family is not supportive and a few members of my immediate family does not believe that I have an ED because I am overweight (even tho I have been diagnosed by two doctors).

363,363,EatingDisorders,"I'm recovering from a severely broken leg (4 months post op). I'm facing another surgery next month to remove scar tissue.

&amp;#x200B;

My doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Before breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake. I need to not be doing this because I need to recover from this broken leg and I don't want to fall to bad habits again.

I suffer badly with extreme period pain and have to take codeine to even get through my periods laying in bed and even then the pain drives me to sickness. This stops me from loosing weight and its fucking upsetting. I want a baby desperately which is why I suffer the pain of my periods every month but I've had four miscarriages now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm obese after loosing a baby at 16 weeks last year and never shifting the baby weight and also after taking a multitude of antidepressants last year to try and feel some semblance of normal, most of them made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight on top of the weight I had already put on and I've lost control of my eating disorder once again.

&amp;#x200B;

As a teen I struggled with anorexia and bulimia and I suppose it would be covered under the blanket term 'eating disorder not otherwise specified' or 'EDNOS' for short. I'm 20 now and I've gone the other end with binge eating disorder and general emotional eating. I have never had a healthy relationship with food. I want to loose weight desperately because I'm sick of being large, I have issues with my knees, hips and ankles and always have and being overweight has only worsened that. My biggest issue is that exercising and calorie counting genuinely triggers me just thinking about it. In the past during attempts to loose weight I have fallen back into a pattern of exercising in secret, under eating and all my old tricks I don't care to include here. In fact it was emotional eating for 8 months then suddenly trying to cut out food entirely that made me balloon multiple dress sizes years ago that left me 'plus size' in the first place. I honestly went up about 3 dress sizes in a week and haven't gone down since I stayed consistent for years at that size fluctuating a little within it and now I've gone up a size again. It's made such a huge difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just fed up because thinking about how skinny I was makes me want to vomit and it's a bad habit I want to cut from my life. My eating disorders started because of my mum calling me fat and my peers calling me fat purely because my thighs jiggled and I had large breasts. Even at my skinniest I had double D's (UK size if you're curious).

I just want to be able to loose weight without falling into disordered eating and pro-ED behaviours.

I've searched this a bit and only find things that are the opposite.

I'll get really anxious and then won't eat at all because I feel I shouldn't eat anything that others may want. But when I'm doing well I won't think about it and then I'll eat something that I'll learn later my roommate wanted or she wanted to share with a friend so I'll hit myself for not being conscientious enough.

369,369,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I'm male 40+ with a lifelong struggle with eating. I've spent years seemingly bulimic and years seemingly anorexic. Mostly, though, the common thread seems to be some sort of OCD self soothing that's happening. My weight has never been healthy but it's now severely out of control and I think it's beyond me to help myself. I've done all the things I can think of and eating is really strikingly something I must do vs want to do. It's been causing sexuality issues for 25+ years, has been caused by or contributed to severe body and gender dysmorphia feelings. Im mentally ok, but I am not and have not been living anything like a sustainable life. I just can't do things I should be a me to do.. need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

So:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for anyone here to help diagnose what's happening....but where do I start? All of the above is self-diagnosing and I would much rather work out with a professional what is actually happening. I live in a very remote, very rural area and my PCP is probably not someone I can go to productively. I need contacts online . What are good resources? What do I look for?

&amp;#x200B;

Second question is: I've been sort of fantasizing about being locked up lately and just detoxed. I feel like just a break from my patterns is needed urgently....in addition to professional long term therapy and support. Has anyone gone to or had success with places like Alsana as an inpatient for a month? How did it work? I'm assuming stuff like Hilton Heads ""wellness"" retreats are unhelpful?

I was previously overweight and had frequent binge eating episodes but would do so in private and never spoke to anyone about my emotional eating habits. I started using a calorie tracking app to get to a healthy weight, but I still have the desire to lose more weight because I think I would like how my body looks if I could lose more.

I’m now at a point where all that I think about is food/calories and exercise. I made an appointment with a dietician to talk about how many calories I should be eating a day, my weight, diet, etc. and they said they didn’t feel comfortable sharing a specific caloric number with me because they feel that I am exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating and did not want to exacerbate it. She recommended I speak with a colleague who specializes in eating disorders so I set up an appointment.

I am aware that I am engaging in patterns of disordered eating because I do not trust myself to eat without tracking everything on the app. I’m scared that it may have progressed to a disorder at this point given what the dietician told me today. She recommended I delete the calorie tracker from my phone but I cannot get myself to so that (I have tried in the past but can never go more than a few days before redownloading)

My partner and family are big eaters, and encourage me to eat more even when I don’t want to. I don’t know how/if I should talk to them about this. I feel so uncomfortable eating in social settings because I always end up eating more than I intended; I like eating alone because I feel more in control.

Hello, my name is Winnie and I have been struggling with anorexia for a while.

Recently, I have made the decision to try and recover, although it has been extremely difficult without outside support to help me along the way. I'm making an effort to eat when I feel hungry, and to have foods that I want. Despite the anxiety and guilt, I try my absolute best to push through. I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.

However, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself ""oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,"" or ""you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.""

I (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me… I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that’s anxiety or if my body can’t handle food anymore.

My parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn’t help when they encourage it but I am always met with “we are just trying to make sure you’re healthy” and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.

I am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don’t know how I’d get there since I don’t have a car and my parents can’t know I’m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them?

I'm trying to eat like a normal person but for some reason I can't stop eating cookies and cake during the day. Like, yesterday I ate half a pack of cookies and 1/4th of an homemade cake. I don't even restrict on those, I mean not more than any person with an healthy relationship with food. I'm anorexic and I'm either restricting or eating junk food throughout the day.

About 7 months ago, due to my doctors instructions, I had to overhaul my diet due to some health issues. Before I went on this diet I was in a healthy weight, leaning a bit towards heavier than my usual weight since I had stopped working out during the pandemic. My health issues have been a significant part of my life for the past 7 years, and the possibility of not having to deal with them as much is honestly both scary and something I’m really looking forward to.

I have made good progress so far, and my health issues have reduced considerably. However, I fear I may have gone too overboard with the health regiment. I am now edging closer and closer to underweight than I have ever in my life, and I find it difficult to let myself eat bigger portions or add things to my diet that I shouldn’t have often (even if I’m allowed to every now and then). I haven’t really given myself any “treats” or off days in months, and I am starting to get anxious when I gain weight or feel like I’m deviating from my diet instructions.

I’ve always had a very healthy relationship with food, and I feel like I’ve lost that a bit. Some days I don’t even really feel hungry and struggle to eat because I don’t really have as much joy when eating, it all just seems like a “necessary for survival” thing rather than anything else. Some days I don’t have that much energy to do things either, though I am trying to eat balanced and in big enough portions.

Has anyone gone through something like this and could tell me how they managed? I just think I’m having a hard time finding the middle ground. I don’t want to end up being too weight conscious (which I already am, if I’m being honest) or damaging my health this way when I’m supposed to be doing this to get better. Is there anything I should be looking into or doing?

Hello,

I need some help. I have no official diagnosis yet but fall into BED (imo) and I am overweight. My Dr wants me to eat a particular diet which I have been trying to stick to since January but I fail. The longest I can stick to it is 12 days before I start to binge. How do I stop?

Also I am curious if it sounds like I have a disorder at all. I understand I would need to see a specialist someday for a diagnosis but would appreciate to hear if anyone else is like me. For me I can be not hungry for a long time and won't seem to struggle and then I get a sudden craving for a particular food and I almost eat nothing but that food for days on end until I get so sick of it and don't eat it for sometimes years. Sometimes foods I've never really eaten before or sometimes it is childhood comfort food. I've been like this for a very long time. I'll just eat it 4 or 5 times a day where as other days I can go most of the day not excessively peckish. I've been eating cheese and spring onion sandwiches for days on end and can't stop wanting them.

I am so upset with myself because I'm due to go back to my dr in a few days and no I've ruined the progress I made last month.

I’ve ate scrambled eggs hundreds of times before and never had it which is always the case.

Looking for advice from anyone who has struggled with this. I grew up an athlete since 7 years old and competed through college, I did some marathons after college and eventually ended up with an autoimmune disease that forced me to the sidelines on occasion. I've struggled with over exercising and restricting/binging for many years. I had a good 5 years maybe that I actually stopped binge eating, even though I was exercising fairly heavily, I think because I was super strict with my diet as far as what I could eat basically meat, veggies and some fruit, I did this for my autoimmune disease but it really helped as far as not binging. I'm not a ""moderator"" as in, I find it pretty much impossible to eat just a little bit of certain things, they end up making me want more once I have them and I obsess over them (sugar in particular), so when I eliminated all of those triggers I didn't feel the urge to binge. I did eat a TON, but I finally felt good about my body composition and didn't feel crazy around food despite being fairly limited in what I was eating. It took my binge/restrict mindset away. I realize many people may disagree with this and think we all need to eat our trigger foods so we're not triggered by them anymore, but I've tried way too many times to do this and for me personally this doesn't work.

Enter Covid and a constant flare in my autoimmune disease, and staying at home I somehow thought I would just ""try other foods again"" to see if they made a difference in my disease. And now over a year later of back and forth binging/restricting/fasting over exercising, and I'm pretty much miserable right now.

I find that when I overdo it with my exercise, I get extremely hungry and stressed. It messes with my sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and then can't get back to sleep which then makes me crave binge foods more. However I feel somewhat addicted to working out, I think part of it is the endorphins it gives me, and I also don't know what to do with myself when I don't work out. I have other interests, but I feel as if something is missing when I don't exercise. I believe that if I could take some time off, it would be easier to get a hold of my eating and get back on track. I just am having a really difficult time convincing myself to do it. I tell myself again and again that I need to take some time off or that I won't push myself so hard when I go to the gym, and then I completely over do it and it sets me up to want to binge.

I know I can stop binging since I've done it before and legitimately thought I was done with it, but I did a year and half of tracking calories and lost quite a bit of weight, which I didn't really need to, and now I recently lost weight due to some antibiotics I had to take but am having rebound eating from that. Every time I lose a good amount of weight my body goes into overdrive to make up for it eventually.

To people who have never dealt with binge eating, I know this will seem stupid, but it's a legitimate struggle. I want to be able to work out hard without having extreme hunger and stress which leads me to want to binge, but I think I need to find a way to moderate my exercise. Does anyone have any tips or dealt with as similar situation? I'm revisiting Brain Over Binge and Never Binge Again, and I know I just need to stop reinforcing the binging, but I feel like my over exercise is a large component to this.

I should say I'm trying to get back to the way of eating I was on when I was binge free but it has been insanely difficult I think because I'm still currently working from home and my structure is not there like it used to be.

Okay so im making this post on behalf of my beautiful amazing girlfriend because honestly im at a loss. I strongly suspect she has an ED but she wont get tested because you can be professionally discriminated against (lower salary) if you have things like that on your medical record here (were hoping to move away one day but thats not in the cards until after she finishes uni and we both have some monry behind us), so we dont know what it is or if she has one but i really suspect she does as she has alot of symptoms in common with my best friend and cousin who both have/had eating disorders / body dysmorphia.

So, her symptoms (idk if thats the right word sorry) as far as ive seen so far is that she gets nauseous almost every time she eats; she has to force herself to finish the last bite as in her words she feels as though doing that is what will make her nauseous (which is part of why i believe the nausea is caused psychologically rather than physically but idk); she really cant eat alot normally unless shes having a good food day / is in a good mood; and alot of the times when she finds a food she likes, shell have it a couple of times then says its bland / makes her nauseous.

I really dont know what to do as were long distance right now because of covid and shes staying with her mother whonis very negative about food in general, criticises her for not eating enough but then when she eats foods that her (vegetarian, pseudo health science (literally believes you can live off of sunlight and water)) mother doesnt approve of shes negative then too, so my girlfriends entire attitude around food is very poor and she has zero support at home.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? And/or how to combat some of these symptoms or get around them?

Post: Almost 2 years ago I finally opened up about my anxiety and depression and got medicated/therapy. I never discussed with my therapist about this because I thought it was somewhat normal, but for around this time my depression was exceptionally high which caused my eating habits to be amplified. By this I mean that somedays I would be in bed until 3-6pm not having eaten anything, and not be motivated to do anything. As soon as I got up out of bed, I would start my binge eating. Usually I would eat one whole pizza, a big soda and just lots of junk food, and even then I would still eat more and more. some days I would just *choose* not to eat anything for no specific reason, and once I felt like it, I would start the binge eating again.

Honestly, I don't know if this counts. I'm sorry for wasting your time if it doesn't. Since around 12 or so years old, or 3-5 years ago (I have difficulty with time due to trauma), my mother has been digging into my self esteem. She'd grab my stomach to show how 'fat' I was, even though I was a healthy weight. She's shame me about my body, tell me my stretch marks were gross. I gained a chest and a butt, unfortunately. My mother used this as proof I was overweight. She's used the things I love and my insecurities to pressure me to lose weight. When I told her I had dysphoria and didn't like my chest she told me to lose weight. When I went to a wresting competition she tried to get me to lose weight so I could be in a lower weight class. When I joked about how weird knees are, she told me to lose weight so I ""wouldn't have that extra skin"". I was encouraged to lose weight in unhealthy ways. I lost too much weight too fast and all she said is ""it doesn't show."" I was told to eat less that xxxx calories a day (very low)), which lead to me crying. I've vomited to get food out of me once, and I'm scared I'll do it again. I can't go to my mother because she wouldn't believe me because I'm not thin. I even had lipoedema, a disease characterized by fat in the legs that is metabolically independent. I was muscular! Every time I try to recover or build up my self esteem she tears it down again. I've considered suicide because of this. I wouldn't tell her that because it feels too manipulative. I just don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

I started a new job two months ago and the area I’m in is heavily male dominated, there are only two women in a 25 people group, so I immediately started bonding with this other girl, it also helps that we’re from the same country so it’s easier to engage in a conversation with her as we speak the same language.

All conversations are about fat-free, sugar-free, bad food, etc.

I lost a significant amount of weight and felt extremely good, I finally could go up the stairs running without catching my breath, my knees and back felt relieved and I loved the exercise that I was doing. I wasn’t cutting any food group, and ate dessert whenever I wanted, it felt like I was on the right track.

&amp;#x200B;

During my journey, I read and watched multiple videos on healthy weight loss and I was doing CICO while learning about healthy life. I never restricted too much, but I had some anxiety surrounding my caloric intake. I felt like I had to eat less than my calorie goal and it didn’t feel quite right. A few months after I started my journey we had a lot of issues at home, my sister got pregnant and my parents are extremely conservative. This took away my safe space and I stopped doing exercise and had to put up with my narcissistic parents and deal with their yelling and shaming. I was under a lot of pressure due to university work as I was doing my last trimester.

When I was going into 7th grade, the month before school started, I just…didn’t eat. It wasn’t a conscious effort, I just didn’t feel like going to the kitchen to make anything.

I lost a lot of weight this way, and as I was overweight before, my mom noticed. She mentioned it and asked if I had anorexia but I said no, but what I noticed was that every time she mentioned me not eating, it made me want to go longer without food. I weighed myself a lot in this time.

Throughout the school year, my friends and one of my teachers commented, “you’re a twig” (and things of that nature) and “did you lose weight over the summer?”, respectively. For seventh and eighth grade, whenever I noticed my stomach was sticking out more than I liked, I would just think to myself “okay, just don’t eat until it’s flat”. I still ate a lot of snacks and food but I wasn’t physically able to eat as much as before.

My parents always comment on how thin I am, even though now I eat more (although very occasionally I feel regret when I eat a lot of snacks at once. I think of throwing up but I never go through with it), and I know I don’t have a healthy eating pattern, because I tend to go a long while without eating much and then I just eat a lot at once and the cycle repeats. I don’t consciously do it, but it happens.

My mom noticed I started gaining weight and mentions my stomach, arms, and face/chin a lot. I get kinda nervous when they take my weight at the doctors office because she asks them about my weight and how much I weighed at the last visit and I can’t tell what she’s thinking, as she has a poker face but also looks like she’s thinking. Before that summer before seventh grade, she also constantly talked about how I needed to lose weight and when I was a lot younger, she put me on a diet.

I don’t feel like this is an eating disorder, but is it?

TL;DR There was a period of time where I didn’t eat and wanted to stop eating even more when people commented about it or I noticed my stomach sticking out.

&amp;#x200B;

Struggled with eating disorders my whole life, starting at about 12 or so. Really toxic family-you're familiar I'm sure. I don't want to get into the specifics of how unhealthy my relationship with food and exercise was- but I was big into pro-ana tumblr if that gives you some kind of measure of where my head was at. Somewhere in 2015/16 I started working on it and became more comfortable with food, and slowly over time I just.. abandoned all diet and exercise. I felt like I couldn't handle looking at any kind of nutrition or workout routine in a healthy way so I just tuned it all out. Not so shockingly, I ended up putting on a lot of weight. But to be honest, I didn't mind. I liked not having the stress of diet or exercise preying on my every move and destroying my mental health. I didn't love my body but I was accepting of her new look and figured it was a fair trade for not having to think about food/workingout/looking perfect all the time. That's the background story, more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Completely ignoring and avoiding something is not the same as healing from it and I came to recognize that. Since 2020 I've been slowly working on making healthier choices and being a little more active. And I liked it! This year I've started doing lots of activities that I've missed and feeling really good doing them. The last time I was active, it was a means to an end- I enjoyed the results and the process was sacrifice to achieve it. I forgot how great it is to run just for the pleasure of running. Physical activity feels amazing and brings me so much happiness! And I've been healing my relationship with food, making healthy choices for health's sake while still enjoying some less-than-healthy favorites. Honestly? I'm really happy with where I'm at and how I got here. It took years and I'm only excited to see where this goes. I would love to become more physically capable so I can enjoy more achievements within my new hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky:

&amp;#x200B;

Ana sits on my shoulder like a devil and whispers into my ear. I've noticed my own weight loss and I try not to give it too much space in my life. A part of me will always have that ED and I have to deal with that everytime I look in the mirror. That's a struggle on it's own, but one I've been managing.Everyone else, however, keeps commenting on my weight loss and its devastating. I'm aware that I've lost weight but I have been so so careful to make sure it's not a focal point for me. I don't count any calories or look at portions and I don't weigh or measure myself. I measure my progress in what I'm physically capable of. A few months ago I could barely run 3km. Last week, I ran 13km! I've put in a lot of work and I'm finally seeing progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I said that to a friend recently: that I had run 13km and I was happy to be seeing progress and he said, ""I'll say you can see progress! That shirt's hanging off you like a tent!"" A few people joined in behind him, remarking on my weight loss, singing my praises. My heart shattered. Weight loss hadn't even occurred to me as something worth being proud of. It was just a side-effect of my hard work. There I was beaming about my accomplishment and it was inconsequential compared to how i looked.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I have to work extra hard to make sure I keep my mind focused on what's important so I don't slip into a bad place- But that now that task feels impossible since it seems that everyone only cares about weight. It feels like I could run a marathon and they'd tell me how amazing I Look.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm disheartened. I haven't even lost that much weight (posting numbers is against the rules, but believe me, it hasn't been much and it's been over the course of months) and EVERYONE comments on it. I don't have a single person in my life who hasn't brought it up. It makes me sick and honestly? It makes me want to quit doing anything just so people stop talking about my body and my weight.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm terrified the more I get praised and complimented for my weight loss- the louder Ana gets. The validation of people liking me and liking my appearance more is equal parts saddening and tempting. I haven't slipped up yet: I'm still eating well and I'm not over exerting myself but I am thinking about my weight and my body more. I'm finding myself longing for more weight loss- and this wasn't the case before people started commenting.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed that off my chest, but I'm also looking for advice. It's a struggle quieting my own mind against ED... but the struggle of standing up to others and quieting their voices in my mentalscape was a challenge I wasn't prepared for.

407,407,EatingDisorders," 

I've been underweight my whole life. I seem unable to gain weight even if I try. I don't really fear gaining weight- maybe a little afraid, but not much just because it seems unlikely that I ever would due to my eating habits.

I also love food. I'm passionate about cooking, baking, etc. Sometimes I have an issue with binging on desserts, and I do so privately so my partner doesn't judge me.

But most of the time, I under eat. I can't tell if I do it on purpose or not. I just take small portions and get anxious if I think about eating more. Sometimes I don't realize it's a small portion until after I take a picture of my food or something and then look at it again. I'll have a couple olives and feel guilty about it. I think the guilt is partially tied into financial reasoning and memories from a child where I was afraid about my parents being poor. If I have a binge eating session, the rest of the day or the next day I'll under eat to make up for the cost of the food I binged on. It's not like I'm in financial trouble now but I starve myself a bit anyway as a punishment or way of making up the lost money. When I'm stressed and having negative thoughts about my self, I'll also avoid eating too punish myself for being stupid or whatever it was that I was thinking negativity about.

I tried a version of a keto diet previously (not for weight loss) and became very obsessive over counting carbs and calories, and weighed everything I ate (including herbs) and tracked it. I think that opened my eyes to my general issue with food restrictions.

So, I want to ask if this sounds like an eating disorder. I'm a bit unsure because I really don't think about my weight much and I don't know if that's makes it not an eating disorder.",,Request: Is this an eating disorder?,2,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,offpwc,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/offpwc/request_is_this_an_eating_disorder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/offpwc/request_is_this_an_eating_disorder/,1625651360,334,0,0,0,-1,1,"Under eating, binging on desserts, feeling guilty about eating, financial concerns, negative self-talk",harmful,"Takes small portions and feels anxious about eating more, Feels guilty about eating even small portions, Under eats after a binge eating session as a form of punishment, Avoids eating when stressed and having negative thoughts about self, Developed obsessive behavior around food while on a keto diet","Under eating, binge eating, guilt after eating, financial anxiety, negative self-talk, obsession with food restrictions",harmful,"Under eating and binge eating are causing physical and emotional harm to the writer, Guilt and negative self-talk are reinforcing restrictive eating patterns, Obsession with food restrictions is causing additional stress and anxiety","Under eating, issue with binging on desserts, feeling guilty about eating small portions, associating under eating with punishment",harmful,"Experiences guilt and anxiety around food, including feeling guilty about eating small portions and binging on desserts in private, Associates under eating with punishment and financial reasoning, Developed an obsessive mindset around food after trying a keto diet"
408,408,EatingDisorders,"\\(Sorry I know this question has been asked many times) I’m 19 and I’ve had problems with eating since I was about 13 I think - I’ve always felt excessively guilty after eating meals and hate the sensation of being full because of the shame, physical discomfort and general panic it causes me. There have been a handful of occasions where this feeling has gotten so bad that I’ve made myself purge, but I mostly find it difficult so I try to purge after I eat somewhat frequently but most of the time I can’t get anything up. I then tend to resort to excessive exercise in the gym, and also when I don’t meet my step goal I feel exceptionally guilty and pace around my room until I get my target. 

I also count calories religiously and get very distressed when other people touch my food or cook for me because I don’t know how accurately I can estimate the calories. I know I have a bad relationship with food and I do talk to a therapist about it but I don’t know if I can call it a full-blown eating disorder because I’m technically overweight by bmi standards (mostly because of the amount of muscle I have as I lift weights 5x a week) and I don’t know if I’d call my weight loss “drastic” I’ve lost xx kg in a few months but then gained it back so I don’t know if I even meet the DSM criteria for Atypical AN. And I don’t know if I purge enough to be considered bulimic. I’m reluctant to self diagnose but I do want to have some sort of label because I always feel so invalid in the ED community.

I've had ideas of skipping meals but i never seem to go through with it, I've even thought about forcing myself to vomit.

I have this overwhelming need for control and order, and I need to stick to such rigid rules that don’t even matter, but with all my other diagnoses, it’s hard to… I hold it against myself, dissociate, and avoid eating because everything needs to be perfect and if it’s not, I can’t eat until it is… and it never will be, and so I hardly ever eat. It’s taken a toll on my body dysmorphia, making it the worst it’s ever been. I feel ugly the way I am, and I feel ugly if I gain any weight, and I just feel like I’ll always be ugly, so what’s the point in trying to recover? On top of that, I’m terrified of looking “womanly”. I’m nonbinary and I am constantly dysphoric about my body and appearance. I’m very fem presenting, but I’m terrified of looking any more womanly than I already do, and to constantly be perceived as a woman. Not eating somehow makes me feel more easy to pass as masc when I want to, but I’m equally as terrified as being seen as masculine as I am to be seen as feminine. I feel trapped in my body all the time because it will never look like how I want it to. It literally does not help that I relate my gender-fluidity more to cisness than transness—I always tell myself that I’m not trans enough and I get so hung up on trying to be female when I just genuinely don’t feel like that, and it’s a never-ending cycle that feeds into my eating disorder. And to make things worse, now I’m stuck in a depressive episode feeling both underwhelmed and overwhelmed with life, and I just wish I didn’t exist. I wish I could just return my life.

It’s like little Spongebobs running around my brain, throwing files everywhere, starting a fire. My emotions are off the walls, but I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and numbness more often than not. It’s the complete opposite of my usual positive mindset.

Hi. I need some help, but where i'm from there isn't that kind of help available. So i thought why not ask reddit. Like what's there to loose.

Im 165 cm, xx kg (a little more than normal range of BMI). I am currently on a keto diet (kind of). You see, my problem with diets are always the same. I start restricting myself and then I developed an unhealthy relationship with everything im not allowing myself to eat until i reach a breaking point and buy what im not supposed to eat. Eat it, and then purge. Just a few days ago. I was so hungry. I left work, bought stirfry noodles with peanut sauce ate the whole thing then made myself purge..

I am not happy, I am never happy on a diet. I must go on a diet, because I can't limit myself and end up gaining too much weight to the point where I dont feel comfortable and am on the verge of getting diabetes (which a lot of my family members have they also have high blood pressure).

I have tried to get help. But to no avail.. I feel like this is going to be a struggle for ever and I don't know if I can live like this.

I dont know if this is the right place for this post, im kind of hoping it is. Has anyone had the same struggles, and later on over come them?

She recently had issues with an irregular period as well, but they couldn't find any abnormalities in her physiological functioning as a cause. It is suspected to be a lack of nutrition, which leads me to believe that this issue may have been going on for longer than I thought it did.

I was a bit harsh, and might have overstepped because I was worried- I first tried to make her eat by asking her constantly about breakfast, lunch and dinner to make sure she didn't forget. I did not realise that this could be an eating disorder at first. I assumed she simply wasn't prioritising food enough and wanted her to take care of herself.

Later I realised that it was a lot more serious than that, and although I had tried not to, I was concerned that I was guilttripping her, which could do more harm than good. I apologised, and I don't ask aggressively about her food intake anymore- however, I feel like any efforts that she might have made when I did, have completely dropped now. She's been experiencing a cold feeling and dizziness at random times now. I'm quite worried.

My friend and I don't live in the same area anymore, so I feel a little less helpful than I could be, although we talk almost everyday. She's been in therapy for anxiety before, but her parents withdrew her a year or so ago. We don't know if they would be open to reconsideration since they're having issues with medical insurance right now. She recently started going on the pill for period correction, but it had a negative effect so they stopped her.

I know I shouldn't use Google as a diagnosis tool, but her symptoms seem to closely match that of Avoidant Food Intake Disorder. She complains that eating food makes her want to puke, and the thought of eating scares her abnormally. She's worried that eating food will make her feel sick, and she avoids eating because ""she's worried there'll be leftovers that she'll have to eat later"". Whenever she does eat, it seems to be tiny portions of random snacks that have no nutritional value- which probably increases the sick feeling.

Can someone give me tips on how to help her get into eating better and help her hold out until she can get therapy? Although she hasn't expressed much annoyance, I don't want to be overbearing- but her parents have given up on her eating breakfast and aren't aware that she isn't eating much else for the rest of the day.

I'm trying my best to emotionally support her, telling her that how she feels towards food isn't ridiculous in any way, and that her struggle is valid. I try to encourage her to eat in less aggressive ways, bringing up my lunch and trying to describe it in an appetizing way, etc etc. I might be doing it wrong though, so I'd really appreciate some pointers on how I can support her.

I’ve been doing so well… I went to a treatment program two years ago and I felt “cured”. I felt like nothing could ever make me restrict or use any ED behaviors again. I thought I was free.

A few months ago I started birth control pills, to prevent pregnancy. For many reasons I am not comfortable with other methods of birth control, like the non hormonal iud for example. The pill is pretty commonly reported to cause weight gain. I went into it telling myself that it would be ok, I could handle any changes that happened, it was worth not getting pregnant, etc. I learned that the hormones really just make you hungrier, they don’t magically make you gain weight.

However, learning this fact has made me so untrusting of my hunger cues ever since I started. I’m not consciously restricting but it’s like every time I’m hungry outside of a meal I just ignore it because I blame it on the pill and not my actual hunger. I don’t measure food anymore but I feel I have been eating less, but telling myself it’s not ED related. “Oh it’s just stress” “oh it’s the nausea from the pill” etc.

I don’t really body check anymore but I do own a mirror, and I wear clothes (lol). I don’t want to mention anything specific but now I’m noticing that little body checks I would have done a few years ago would make me very pleased, if I were to engage in them today. I don’t own a scale but it seems I’m losing weight pretty quickly again. I know I need to just force myself to eat despite the nausea, despite the stress, despite the fear of the birth control making me “too hungry”… but something in me is scared. I’m so angry at myself for being scared. I did it before. Why is weight gain still so scary to me?

I'll start by saying I'm already in contact with a therapist's office and waiting for them to get back to me once my insurance is processed. It's been two days now, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, because I think this might be the beginning of something I need to catch early.

I've always had body-image issues. I grew up with a father that made comments on my weight very often, even though I was never overweight as a child. I'm in my early twenties now, and overweight, and every time I come home, he comments in some way. Usually it's a comment on when/how much I'm eating. A few years ago, when I was a teenager, I started restricting under the recommended minimum. I stopped because I was recovering from an alcohol addiction and wanted to be honest about every aspect of my life. I've tried to lose weight more times than I count, and every time it ends in me giving up on the calorie counting and binging, sometimes for long periods, which has contributed to my weight gain. I'm told by my friends and men that ""it suits me"" and that they don't think I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop equating ""skinny"" with ""pretty."" But, more than that, now that I think about it. Worthy.

So, it started with that cycle again, just me deciding to count calories, but within the recommended range. And then I saw a pro-ED Tiktok, and then I sought out that kind of content, and started restricting far too much again. I've had physical symptoms now and it's scaring me. The thing that's scaring me the most is that I have tried to stop, and I can't. Now, the thought of food honestly fills me with dread. It truly feels easier to just be hungry than eat. I have done well these past two days, meeting the recommended minimum. I have a friend that's been checking in with me. The weird thing that's helped with it is intermittent fasting. It's like if I tell myself, ""Okay, you have to eat, and you have to eat enough, but only in this 8 hour period,"" it's doable, at least for now. But I'm terrified of what I might lower myself to tomorrow.

So I finally called a therapist. The thing is, I'm really afraid to be honest with her. I'm graduating college in a year, and it's been rough ride for me. I've been hospitalized for depression several times, and although I'm grateful that those inpatient stays saved my life, they did disrupt my life, especially my academic life. I can't bear the thought of losing what I've worked so hard for (to clarify, I'm taking classes right now to graduate on time). If I tell her how low I've been restricting (I'm trying not to use numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting too specific with what I have said), I'm afraid that she'll IVC me. I'm not underweight, again, I'm actually a good bit overweight, and I can't see any emergent symptoms right now - I also am not having any suicidal ideations.

I'm sorry, because I think I'm partially coming here for validation. I feel like I can't have an eating disorder because I'm overweight. I know if I were to tell my family, they would tell me that I'm ruining everything I've almost lost before, and the thing that kills me is I KNOW I am. I know why I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm still doing it. I ate enough today and yesterday, but I'm still spending so much time on those sites. And I still feel pretty when I'm hungry while I'm fasting. This is something, much like alcohol (which I haven't consumed in three years), I just don't think I know how to fix on my own. If I'm told that she probably will commit me, honestly, that's fine. I'll go and I'll be honest anyway, because I have to be alive to graduate. I just would like to know what to expect. It's also good motivation, in a macabre way, to eat enough in the days leading up to meeting with her. Any suggestions people have that have worked for them to get themselves to eat are more than welcome. I want to eat, I do, I'm just afraid of it. I'm thinking of calling my best friend and asking if I could send her my calorie counts at the end of each day for accountability, but I don't know if that's crossing boundaries too much - I don't want to make someone else feel responsible for my safety. She's a sweetheart and I know she'd say yes but I don't want to be codependent with her. I'm just trying to think of ways to stay safe until I can get some help, and I don't know that fasting is the right way to do it. That could spiral, too.

Sorry, this has gone on forever.

TL;DR - I'm going to a therapist about restricting my intake too low and I'm afraid she'll IVC me. I'm asking for experience on getting yourself to eat when you're afraid to do so, and also wondering if fasting could put me in more danger even though it's helping right now.",,Request: I'm afraid to see a therapist because I'm afraid I'll be committed,39,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,oc6tq1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,1625219329,886,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments on weight from father, history of body image issues, exposure to pro-ED content",harmful,"Restricting food intake to the point of physical symptoms, Fear of being honest with therapist and potential hospitalization, Feeling like cannot have an eating disorder because of being overweight, Using intermittent fasting as a way to control food intake and feeling pretty when hungry","Negative comments on weight from father, history of body image issues, exposure to pro-ED content on Tiktok",harmful,"Restricting food intake to dangerously low levels, Feeling scared of food and equating ""skinny"" with ""worthy"", Physical symptoms and fear of lowering food intake further","Body-image issues from childhood, father making comments on weight, exposure to pro-ED content, fear of being honest with therapist, fear of being hospitalized",harmful,"Restricting food intake to dangerous levels, Experiencing physical symptoms related to malnutrition, Feeling afraid of food and equating ""skinny"" with ""worthy"", Feeling like they cannot stop restricting despite physical symptoms, Considering using intermittent fasting for accountability, Feeling like they cannot have an eating disorder because they are overweight, Feeling like they are ruining their academic progress"

Hello. I’ll be honest, 4 months into recovery, and I still can’t accept how my body has changed. I’m having daily panic attacks over my shape during trips to the bathroom. I’m also distressing knowing that all of this anxiety hasn’t gotten me to stop eating like I want. It feels like every waking hour of my life is spent dealing with nagging thoughts about eating and hunger. I’m insatiable, and I’m now the biggest that I have ever been.

Nonetheless, I saw to my ED specialist today, and she wasn’t concerned about my weight or my eating. She specifically quashed my fear that I might be bingeing, so now I’m not sure how to deal with my appetite and changing body. All I want to do is go on a diet to lose weight, but everyone—from my doctor to my therapist to my girlfriend to my own inner voice—is telling me I shouldn’t do that.

Is this an eating disorder? I'm sorry in advance if this triggers you So, in the past few months there’s been a ton of shit happening in my life. Family issues, friend issues, my ex tried to commit suicide, it’s just been a lot.

I’ve been struggling with this for a while and my love ones have noticed, and I’ve asked them for help but I’m not sure if it’s just body dysmorphia?

I feel super panicked to eat certain foods, Let me give an example,

The other day, my best friend and my family and I went out to dinner. I had a swim meet and the only thing I had to eat before that was coffee, and one of those low calorie fiber one bars. I did go to work and I ran to target and I purchased 4 Alani nu energy drinks and two boxes of the fiber one bars, and some other non related food things but it was a lot of money I had spent on food.

My best friend came over before we went to dinner and she made a pop tart in my toaster. I told her she was crazy for eating one of those because they are full of sugar and I read this thing that someone literally died from eating one of those. Those things are just cookies basically. And she knows about my eating habits because its gotten better but then I would fall back into the bad path again. She asked me why I was freaking out about those damn pop tarts and I just said they are so bad for you. And she was like well yeah, but you gotta live a little sometimes dude. I said, yes I know.

When we got to dinner, the only thing I ordered was a side salad, which was xxx calories which was perfect for me. She ordered a thing of chicken wings and fries. She tried to put a couple fries on my plate and I quickly told her no. It was a different type of fear that I had felt. She was like, “ok dude.”

I was over at her house last night and her mom made dinner. I was a bit anxious to eat because I went to the gym after swim practice yesterday and I really didn’t want to waste all the calories I had just burned. I just decided to eat a little, because I knew she would flip shit if I didn’t eat, and so would her parents. I put 2 tiny pieces of the little chicken breast and maybe a tablespoon of the salad. Her mom noticed, she says “you eat like bird! Is that enough for you?” My friend says,”She used to eat more.” And then proceeded to give me a really hard look. I told her I’m fine and she doesn’t need to worry. I finished my dinner, and I was helping her do dishes and she was talking about how a milkshake would sound so good. And I told her “ew no” she said,”you used to love those, why doesn’t anything sound good to you anymore?” I said “I don’t know.” And I told her again not to worry and that I was fine and she worries way too much, which she does sometimes😂

We went to the grocery store and I was helping her shop and we were in the ice cream isle and I was so anxious. She’s my best friend, so sometimes we do stupid stuff, this time, I was sitting inside the cart. I was very tired and I was zoning out, that’s why I didn’t want to walk. She was talking about dessert, and I made a face. And she goes,”are you a sugarphobic now?” I feel like I am lol. And I said idk, and then I brushed it off again.

A few hours later My stomach was hurting a lot, so I was laying on her bedroom floor. She asked me if I was ok and I said yes. She told me that I could go home if I wanted to, and I told her I was fine. We were talking and my brain kept wandering and I kept forgetting what I was talking about. She went to the kitchen and got an ice cream bar, I said,”how can you eat one of those things” and she was like because they are good, and you should have one too. And I said,”no I’m tired and I’m going home” so I got up and then I said, are you going to walk me out? Bc she always does! And she said no. I mean it was fine.

Hi there, F34, first time here on reddit. I have recently come to the conclusion that I have an eating disorder, I'd say it's some sort of anorexia, but I only ever find resources about anorexia nervosa, which I think is not my issue. My problematic relationship with food is rather a consequence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and ADHD. I've had episodes of complete loss of appetite since I was a teenager, sometimes it would last days, sometimes weeks, but it would always be linked to some sort of preoccupation that led to anxiety (important exam, new job, heart break and such). I've had only one episode of some sort of bulimia, where I would feel hungry all of the time, which lasted about a month. In the end I never worried too much about it, because it would last a limited amount of time, and then things would go back to normal. But this year has been different. It's obviously been a tough year, psychologically speaking. But I first noticed a weight loss upon getting a serious parasitic infection, which makes sense. The problem is I never quite recovered appetite, cause depression and anxiety piled up, and then I started medication that also tends to lower appetite. Work has been really tough (I'm doing a PhD overseas), and the work load and stress is just too much for me to actually care to think about food. All in all, I lost xxkg in less than a year (I'm 1m64 tall, and went from yykg to xxkg, which makes it 20%). In the past months I've also been exercising quite a bit, for I took dance classes that helped me cope with stress. Right now I'm trying to get into healthier habits, chill a bit, dedicate more time to my crafting hobbies, etc. I'v gotten more appetite, but when I do eat complete meals I end up feeling stomach sick, I guess because my body's not used to it anymore. So I guess what I need help with is, how to go back to a healthy diet, given that I've spent months eating very little, and that I have little free time and the whole ""planning for meals, going to the super, cooking, doing the dishes etc"" seems pretty overwhelming to me? What easy/quick/healthy food could I get? Any other recommendation or resource welcome.

Hi all,

My boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.

After those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.

It's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.

Hi, long story. I was always big, over the course of a year or so i lost a massive amount of weight, made bad choices in the way i lost it etc. I've maintained my love for fitness and not just for looks but also performance. I occasionally binged, once a month to maybe once a week etc etc. Now I'm lucky if i can go 2 days without binging. I've tried everything - stopped and started calorie counting countless times, read and tried to utilise books, researched online etc. I've lost hope. I haven't regained all the weight, only about a quarter of it so far. But it's killing me seeing myself undo the one good thing i was proud of.

459,459,EatingDisorders,"Hello, if you do post this, could it be anonymous? My post is as follows: 

I have always struggled with my relationship with food. At the age I became aware of my body and the concept of an “attractive” and an “unattractive” body (i.e 12 y o), I started either eating in extremes as a reward or I would eat scantily for months as a suffering to look a certain way. 

I’m 30 now and but this habit seems to stay. There is a lot of emotional eating and withholding involved. Because of it, I have had to face a myriad of health issues. I got pancreatitis and it gets flared with high fatty food. So either I don’t eat at all, or I eat a lot of high fat content food that has triggered many pancreatitis episodes. Similarly with exercise…either I over-exert myself or I don’t exercise for months altogether. 

Food is not a means to survive for me but a means of enjoyment or punishment. I’m in therapy and this is the realization I have reached. But nothing has come out of it. Unfortunately, there has been throughout my life, a lot of fat shaming from near and dear ones. But I feel like I made space in my life for the comments, I engaged with them so I am part of the problem here.

461,461,EatingDisorders,"I know this community has put up a post on how to help a loved one in treatment but my sister seems to be on the path of developing an ED. I want to know how to help her, I hope this is the right sub. Apologies if it isn't, please do guide me to one that can help if possible. 
Since the pandemic started, my sister began to restrict her meals (she still takes three meals a day but she admits that it's only because of how strict my parents are about making sure we don't skip meals). She started to exercise regularly, which seemed fine. Over the course of last year, she lost a bunch of weight visibly and my (very South Asian, not too sensitive) family made sure they told her how much they've noticed it. When she went back to school, her friends and teachers commented on it too (which made her feel worse, as she told me, ""Does this mean I was really that fat?"")
I had been feeling strange about it and so have my parents, because she used to snack earlier and give in to cravings and now she completely stopped any of that. There were multiple fights over it. Now, she has confessed to me that she's acknowledging that her relationship with food is strained. She has been counting calories on an app for months and even when she deletes the app, she often remembers by now what dish is worth how many calories. She cried to me and said that she thinks she's going to get worse. She also explained that she sometimes spits her food out in the bathroom (no throwing up) because she feels guilty with every spoon that she takes in. On the days she does not exercise, she feels guilty about eating anything at ALL. Basically, it is something that has been bothering her, disrupting her everyday functioning, and actively visible in the way she continues to reduce her eating.
I haven't experienced anything like this in this magnitude. I really want to help her (and she also does want to help herself), just don't know how. I told her that the next time she wants to spit her food out, she should come to me and we will swallow a bite together. And when she is craving chocolate but is stopping herself, to take a small piece and swallow it with me.

462,462,EatingDisorders,"Hello, 

I have struggled in the past on and off with disordered eating (most closely resembling BN, but never sought diagnosis, just recovery). My most recent and most severe lapse was last year during quarantine, wasn't fun. 

With the help of my therapist and husband I managed to stop all behaviors, as I knew I wanted to start a family and my body needed to be able to support a baby. I gained a lot of weight obviously, reaching an overweight BMI, and felt very uncomfortable in my body. Then I got pregnant. 

My morning sickness was bad, and I ended up genuinely unintentionally losing a lot of weight in my first trimester. This I think is what triggered me, the weight loss felt fantastic. I was miserable of course I felt like I had the flu for nearly 2 months straight, but I was weighing myself every week to track how much I'd lost. Sometimes if I had a good day and could eat a lot of food, instead of being happy for the calories I managed to get in to fuel me and baby, I would agonize on whether to resort to old behaviors to compensate. I never did, thankfully. I've been able to put me and baby ahead of ED, but...it was harder than I'd like to admit to make that decision sometimes.

Now my nausea is gone and I feel great, and I know I'm going to start gaining soon, which is GOOD because you need to gain a certain amount in pregnancy for a healthy baby, even if you have an overweight BMI like I do. But even at a lower weight now than when I got pregnant...I'm starting to show, my belly is bigger. But I honestly just look...fatter than before. It doesn't look like im pregnant yet properly. I just have a big tum.

And im just suddenly so disgusted by my body again. I hate it. Not even just my belly, everything I can hate thr size of and want smaller, I do. I've always heard how pregnancy really makes you appreciate your body and see it in a  new way because its creating life...but I feel fat and ugly and I just want to keep losing weight. I'm avoiding scales because I'm scared at how upset I will be. But when I have to weigh myself at the doctor every time that number is seared into my brain.

I guess I just wanted to get out there how im feeling, and see if anyone has been in the same boat, and has any words of wisdom or advice for me because I feel like one heckin failure right now for having these thoughts even though I love my little baby in there and want him to be healthy and happy. I want to do, and eat whatever it takes, but im scared of my own thoughts and scared that even though so far I've been able to push through and do what I gotta do...that one day ill fuck up. 

I wanted to feel in love with my body, not be thrown back into destructive ED thoughts.

467,467,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I (15f) have been struggling with a restrictive ED for over a year now. This led me to becoming extremely underweight and in a life-threatening condition. I had numerous deficiencies, amenorrhea, hypotension, bradycardia, and was at risk of heart failure. If I’d continued like I was, I knew I would probably die, but I had trouble caring. It was only seeing how devastated my parents were when my family doctor had me admitted to the hospital that I decided to comply with recovery. I chose it for them, not me. Stress got my heart rate up enough for me to leave inpatient quickly, though, and return home. About a month and a half later, this is still the case. I’ve more than doubled my caloric intake, but my parents and paediatrician want me to consume over a thousand more than I am now for rapid weight gain.

I can’t bring myself to do it, but my parents are counting calories and serving me food to ensure that I eat as much as they want. I’ve been lying and I feel absolutely awful for what I’m doing, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I’ve turned to either pouring drinks down the sink, flushing it down the toilet, or feeding it to my dogs (when safe for them) to avoid eating food. Has anyone else experienced this compulsion? I’m desperate to stop. I’m literally flushing money down the drain, and soon enough some doctor is gonna catch on that I’m not gaining as much as I should be.

Note that I am still eating enough to gain weight. I think I’m just scared of surrendering control and eating this much and not being able to stop once I’m at a healthy weight— I’m scared of spiralling out of control.

472,472,EatingDisorders,"Hi, would you please post the text below? I really need some advice. Thank you!

I should preface this by saying that I’ve been in recovery for 3 years now (following 6 years of my ED) but still have body dysmorphia and low-level restriction compulsions; I try not to look at my body or shop for clothes, as this is a trigger for me. 
Several months ago, my mom and I looked at wedding dresses. Sharing that moment with my mom was special and shifted the experience from negative to slightly positive. As we didn’t find anything, we agreed to shop again in July (we live in different States). For whatever reason, I have been struggling with relapse the past few weeks and currently am very anxious (borderline dreading) trying on dresses. I have postponed making any bridal appointments. I can’t postpone or change the date to cope with these issues, as we already purchased airline tickets and my family is flying in from a different state to shop with us. Though my partner has been incredibly supportive and encouraging, I have lost some weight (to him, it’s “noticeable”). I know my mom will notice it too. I am planning on talking with her this week, but am at a loss what to say (she thinks that my ED is “done with” and I worry how she will receive this. I really, really want this to be a positive experience, but I HATE my body right now).

I’ve never posted here before and haven’t been able to find anything in the sub about the specific issue I am going through. So both my friend and I have eating disorders. Her disorder is more severe than mine so I have always made it a priority to not engage in behaviors/talk about things that may be triggering to her. However, recently I don’t think she is doing the same for me. I’ve recently noticed that in Snapchat she is clearly sending me photos where she is body checking and showing off the weight she lost (also including numbers) specifically choosing angles that show the size of her waist etc. I love having a friend who gets what I’m going through and understands having issues with food but I can’t help but wonder if it’s doing more harm than good. Is anyone else dealing with something similar?

475,475,EatingDisorders,"I have had a control-related ED since I was a child. It helps me soothe myself and at this point is mostly a habit I can’t stop. I’m 30. 
I can tell my body is suffering. I’m sick a lot, exhausted a lot and very likely have a vitamin or electrolyte deficiency. 

I want to get help but I don’t want to disclose to my doctor in specific terms what behaviour I’ve been engaged in. I have an appointment to see him tomorrow and I’m hoping I can get a blood test, even though I’m scared that if I do have (as I suspect) a severe electrolyte or deficiency, I’ll be interrogated and I’ll have to confess. 

On one hand, I’m scared to get found out because I feel deeply guilty and ashamed for damaging my body. That’s the central thing. I’m caught up in self-blame and I’m ashamed that I’ve been hurting myself. I know it’s a psychological problem of mental health, but I feel like I should be able to just stop and I feel guilty for not taking care of myself and of the reality that I’ve done actual irreversible damage . On the other hand, I can tell that I need medical attention and that I can’t go on like this. The childhood-esque fear of getting in trouble for doing a bad thing to my body is so strong that I have avoided getting medical help all these years. I’m scared that ultimately, shame will prevent me from getting help. I ignore my body’s symptoms often because I can’t handle the guilt and shame and I want to pretend it’s not happening. But it is 😔

The only person I have told is my previous therapist, who moved away and I can’t see anymore. Due to the shame, I could tell her that the problem existed but we never worked through it. I was too afraid and overwhelmed to actually discuss it.

I have a new therapist who I haven’t told. I’m seeing her on Thursday.  Since things are pretty bad mentally, I’m thinking of disclosing (in the same vague terms as I used with my old therapist) to her. I’m worried that telling her (or even getting blood tests done) will overwhelm me.

Much bloating, lots of skin breakout, dizzyness, bad performance during workouts, and I also haven’t got my period this month which I think could be linked to the diet. (I have lost my period a couple more times in the past during my ED and in early recovery.)
I didn’t start this diet to lose much weight, since I’m already on a healthy weight and I haven’t weighted myself in years in order not to trigger my old ED. I only wanted to shred off some excess fat around my belly for summer.
But during this diet I have found it to be much much harder to get full after a meal and I usually eat a second plate or I come back to the kitchen for snacks very quickly.

481,481,EatingDisorders," Hi all, I’m really really desperate and hoping for some help. I’ve lost a chunk of my weight in the last few months and my therapist and psychiatrist especially are worried, my medical doctors are somewhat worried but my labs are fine so they’re convinced if I drop more weight it’s anorexia. I’ve struggled with food my whole life but mostly just being picky, that being said as a kid I was NEVER underweight once I was about 10. My therapist and psychiatrist see some sort of eating issue but it isn’t anorexia, it looks closer to something like AFRID? Basically, I love cooking but will only eat a few bites of a meal. My brain will decide there is only one thing that is appetizing all the rest is disgusting but then I get that one food and either I’m repulsed by it for some reason and then there is literally nothing I want to eat or I’ll just eat a few bites and still lose interest. I’ve always been picky, I’m less picky now than ever but for some reason my eating has gotten a lot worse and I have to super force myself to eat or think about it, I do eat some but I just don’t have a ton of interest. I do still love finding new recipes and I’ll cook dinner for my guy and i when I have time time, the actual eating I guess just doesn’t interest me or something? I really don’t know, the medical doctors are being kinda rude about some of it and I’m just really not sure what to do, I know I need to get better but it honestly doesn’t sound like anything?

this has made me so so stressed, the recent weight loss has made my hair fall more frequently and i deal with a mood instability that makes me mentally drained all the time (idk what this, if it's a mental illness or not because i've never seen a therapist) and overall it just makes everything harder, but since i've never experienced bulimia or have been diagnosed as anorexic i can't really tell if i'm being a fraud or if i should actually try to work my mental set to go get some professional help, but like i said this has been frequent since my early teen days and i learned early about some eating disorder terms and habits thanks to tumblr, but the only thing I have tried has been fasting and drinking only water for as long as i possibly can.

I didn’t realize then but realized later that I was restricting myself way too much and justifying it by saying “if you want results, you gotta work for it”. And I would binge a lot on cheat days. I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that’s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn’t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college.

Hi beautiful people! I'm a 21F looking for advice in a world that seems to have no answers. A little bit of background: I have struggled with disordered eating for a big chunk of my life but I have been committed to recovery for over 3 years now. I love the peace that recovery has brought, and I'm very scared of losing it. Nevertheless, I'm at my highest weight ever and while it doesn't necessarily bother me, all I can think of when I look in the mirror is of how my fat phobic friends and family perceive me. They make comments about how much better I looked before, and I feel the urge to go back to those behaviors just to be more visually pleasing. It might be all in my head, but I feel unsafe in this bigger body in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Attempting ""healthy"" weight loss has never gone well for me, so intentional weightless is not an option, but I feel desperate to feel fully accepted in my community.

505,505,EatingDisorders,"I’ve (F27) had a pattern of what I think would be considered ED behavior since I was in high school, and I’ve been horribly aware of my weight and body shape since elementary school. I’ve always thought I was fat, even though logically I know I am not. I first started barely eating around my sophomore year because I felt like I had lost control of my surroundings, my dad was extremely strict and religious and violated my trust and privacy boundaries a lot (ex: we had a family meeting where he took my diary and read out of it and lectured me on being “impure” for wanting to make out with a boy), and stupidly, was upset about said boy. 

Ever since then I have fallen into the pattern of severely reducing my food intake whenever I am experiencing rejection in my romantic relationships, which has always been in the form of them being unfaithful or lying or both (I am now married and this is happening, I feel trapped). Occasionally other forms of stress will trigger it too, if it’s intense enough. When I see my body start to slim down, or my tummy flatten it only fuels me, because I attach my worth to how I appear, because if I’m pretty enough maybe I’ll be good enough to be the only person my significant other wants. 

At this point I don’t know how to stop, it feels like something I can’t control, my body does not crave food and when I try to eat I feel extremely physically ill and can’t eat normal portions, everything disgusts me except certain comfort junk foods. Sometimes I use thc to boost my appetite which helps but I do not enjoy being dependent on a substance just to eat. I don’t want to take antidepressants to boost my appetite either. 

I am fully aware of all of the horrors with health that comes with this kind of behavior. I am fully aware of WHY I am doing this. But it almost feels like I just don’t care, I just cannot stop, like I deserve it, like I’m not worthy of food or love because everyone I’ve ever loved has shown me that. It also feels like I have a sick sense of kinship with this behavior, like this is all I have to make things better, like it’s the oldest and closest friend I have. I acknowledged openly with people that I didn’t eat in high school but I can’t seem to label myself as having an eating disorder now, because I don’t know if I actually do or ever did, if that makes sense?

 Hi, I'm a 21 year old male who has been struggling with quite severe  anorexia and bulimia for at least 4-5 years now. I've recently gotten a  LOT better in recovery and just kind of now noticing the strange ways in  which my body has kind of stayed in the adolescent stage (if that makes  any sense). I got my hormones checked out and they are all normal, my  testosterone was even above average as I've been working towards a  normal weight, eating better and lifting. Almost normal weight but still  kind of small and almost boy-ish looking. 

But my main concern is that my beard development is at the same stage  it was before I got my ED around age 15. That is, my beard hasn't been  growing since and it has been hitting my confidence quite hard. My male  relatives on both sides can all grow more or less some sort of beard and  I just wonder if this damage is reversible?

512,512,EatingDisorders,"Im a 22 year old woman. I’m a healthy weight currently, but I haven’t eaten more than a (small) meal a day in the past month. I’m not scared to eat, it’s just that the thought of eating food makes me so nauseous that I can’t do it. I only eat at dinner time when I’m so hungry that I can actually eat without nausea. 

Right around quarantine I gained weight like never before and got stretch marks from the weight gain. I’ve been more concerned with my weight this year then ever before, I constantly feel fat and I was swinging in and out of diets and exercising routines from July2020 to March2021. The nausea issue is new, I just... can’t eat. I can’t even sleep now because I’m not eating. I can only sleep after I’ve been awake for ~36 hours.

The part that is freaking me out the most is that I weigh myself several times a day since the nausea issue and I often find myself happy with the weight it caused me to lose. Sometimes if it makes me feel really good about myself I’ll skimp on the one meal a day that I can actually stomach. 

About 3 months ago, I was on my most restrictive diet with calorie counting. I knew it was on the low side, but I thought I couldn’t meet my weight goal unless I did it. Sometimes I found myself wishing I had the willpower to suffer through an Ed for a couple months to lose the weight. I stopped the dieting and exercising in since the end of March because I was worried it was becoming obsessive. But I know I did not will myself into the nausea issue, it just started happening and it hasn’t gone away.

I genuinely hope this isn’t insensitive, I just want to be honest about my feelings towards this issue in hopes of getting good advice.

I've struggled with disordered eating my entire life, as a result of my parents who shamed my sister for gaining weight in college and her expressing disordered thoughts to me--when I got to high school I also got comments that I was gaining weight from my parents, and it really started to spiral in me (I'd skip meals, look at myself and identify the areas of myself I didn't like). Flash forward to 4 months ago, my first college semester on-campus and I would skip some meals, overeat others, and constantly feel bad about my body. The guy I dated briefly then did make a lot of comments to me when I would bring up my weight insecurities: ""you know, the only way to be skinny is to eat less"" ""come work out with me"" ""what do you expect when you're eating all that junk at the dining hall""...yeah that combined with ""you're so fat you've gained so much weight"" when my parents visited me mid-semester kind of put the nail in the coffin. 

I'm an average weight, on the lower side. But I can't help thinking I need to lose weight. I need to. Even if I don't think fat is a bad thing. Even if I see fat people as just as worth life and food as skinny people. And because it's only been a few months of actual restriction/binge cycles, my brain tells me I don't need help since I'm not actually diagnosed and not deathly skinny to the point where I need hospitalization. But at the same time, I'm miserable, I can't not calorie count, I eat half of the minimum calorie intake people should have most of the time, I'm obsessed with body-checking, weighing myself, and crying in the mirror. I don't know what to do, but I'm scared to eat, I'm scared to gain the weight that I've already lost. I simultaneously want to like food but I also need to get worse. 

I'm so afraid that it's too late, I can't just start eating again. I don't even know if it's an actual ED since it hasn't been that long. I'm losing faith in food so, so quickly and today my mother weighed herself on the scale, said her weight (lower than mine), and then proceeded to call herself fat. I had just eaten more than I usually do, and I almost had a breakdown over it. My mom saying that just made me spiral, and I'm thinking of going to extremes tomorrow to lose the weight I gained.

I'm a male, turning 25, in Australia. (If that info helps.)

Hey guys and girls, never thought I'd be in a place like this.

I started my behaviours around 2 years ago, but they became really extreme around last year, limiting calories by a substantial amount, then to purging when I felt I went a little (what I deem ""suitable""/safe, ""safe"" as in not to rupture or damage my throat) over that amount, I have purged large amounts, but I have to do it in secret and the longer I'm gone from my usual places the more questions are asked. So I only purge when I'm a little over my lowly calorie limit, when I binge a lot of food, I just leave it and become very agitated and filled with guilt. 

So last year I began purging, at first it was once or twice a week, then at one stage it was once a day for a fortnight. Then it ""died"" down to once or twice a month from then on. I thought I could keep it around that number. Until last month... I started doing it almost every day again, I did it everyday for a fortnight then it's ""died"" down to 4-5 times a week now. 

I want to tell the professionals I see, to see if they can help, but I don't want them to tell my family, I live with my family and I'm turning 25 this year. I'm just asking here if anyone has input in whether they'll tell my family, or just general advice? It's gotten quite extreme, the purging and the calorie limit (I admit, the calorie limit has improved very slightly, I let myself eat like 20% more calories now compared to last month.) 

I honestly thought I could control this, but it's getting more uncontrollable than I could imagine. I'm slightly overweight, so they might not treat it as serious, that's what I'm thinking any ways. 

The purging made me feel like a living being, but then quickly dulled in that sensation, I'm ""on-paper"" diagnosed  with schizophrenia, which isn't doing very well for me, mostly long term negative symptoms are kicking my ass. I've been in mental health treatment for about 5 years, and I don't want to be that client/patient that keeps going downhill, but I can't help it.",,Request: Can you guys post this? looking for advice on how to reduce/curb feeding behaviours,2,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,npq8a1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/npq8a1/request_can_you_guys_post_this_looking_for_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/npq8a1/request_can_you_guys_post_this_looking_for_advice/,1622540849,390,0,0,0,-1,1,Purging and limiting calories,harmful,"Purging has become more frequent and extreme, now happening 4-5 times a week, Worried about seeking professional help because they do not want family to know, Feeling out of control and unable to manage their eating disorder","Extreme calorie restriction and purging behaviors, fear of professionals telling family",harmful,"Behaviors have become more uncontrollable over time, Living with family and fear of them finding out, Diagnosed with schizophrenia and experiencing long-term negative symptoms",Extreme calorie restriction and purging behaviors,harmful,"Behaviors started around 2 years ago and became more extreme last year, Purging has become more frequent, occurring almost every day for a period of time, The writer is struggling to control their behaviors and is seeking advice on how to get help without involving their family, The writer has a pre-existing diagnosis of schizophrenia that is impacting their mental health"
518,518,EatingDisorders,"Before anyone has a go at me I feel SO STUPID. If anything this is embarrassing for me, I just feel like crying. For the last 8 months or so I've been struggling with an eating disorder. It started out as bulimia, but futher into the new year things only got worse and I eventually ended up losing A LOT of weight in a very short period of time.
Eventually my mum started to get on my ass about it. As well aware of my isssues I am, I continue to live in constant denial. I don't know why- I just can't bring myself to admit to anyone that maybe I'm not doing to great. I always end up dismissing it, or getting irritated.
Anyhow- my mum, obviously caring about me booked me in for a check-up with my GP. This is were things get a bit messy. I don't know what possessed me to make such a dumb decision but it happened nonetheless. Without going into how I actually did this- prior to my appointment I managed to attached x kgs worth of weights to myself. Looking back on it now I'm kicking myself... but it gets worse. Upon weighing me with the weights, it showed that I was on the smaller side or whatever but nothing of concern- I was thinking great I got away with it blah blah blah.
Jokes on me I had a follow-up appointment just a month later. I couldn't just show up having lost x kgs, so once again I repeated that horrendous idea with the weights plus an extra kilo just in case... jokes on me I had still managed to go down on the scale... HOW EVEN? 
At this point I'm being referred to plenty of places and I am happy that I might perhaps get the help I need- however none of these people know I'm significantly lighter than my records have. How can I go about telling my doctor this?
Will he have to tell my mum for 1? Because if anything the only reason I lied to begin with is because my mum stresses me out. If she finds out what I'd done- forget it I'm good as DEAD.

520,520,EatingDisorders,"I don’t know what kind of advice to ask for here, but I need to know I’m not alone. I’ve dealt with some disordered eating habits for a few years now, specifically food avoidance and starvation related stuff. I typically have a good grip on these issues any given day as long as I don’t have to face potential triggers. Welp, about seven months ago I got Covid and lost my sense of smell and taste. That was fine for the most part; I had to battle a lack of appetite (it’s a lot easier to not eat when eating isn’t enjoyable), but after maybe three weeks I fully recovered and my taste came back (smell was still gone, rip.) all fine and dandy, cool, whatever. That is, until about three/four months ago, when my smell came back sour and my taste suddenly turned completely rotten, which leads me to today.

My smell and taste have hit a total road block in recovery. It’s just not happening. For the past four months I’ve had to avoid meat and other forms of protein, along with all of my quick breakfast and lunch foods. Snacking and sweets don’t exist for me anymore, I started having to skip out on dinner and find my own meals, which is a very limited pool for me to choose from, so a lot of times I just don’t try and I make myself go hungry. Even on days where I can stomach whatever is being cooked, walking into the kitchen is like walking into a wall of the smell of rotten meat and it just totally ruins my appetite and mood. I literally have to force feed myself most days. Sometimes I’ll cook something that was perfectly safe for me to eat the day before, only to take a bite and have to spit it out because it tastes so bad. It’s gotten to the point where the second I feel hungry, I get super anxious. 

I’ve basically gotten used to it. A few weeks ago I would have emotional breakdowns over it, but I’ve since learned some foods that I can rely on to be safe consistently. Thing is, it’s so few of them, and I’ve had a really hard time keeping variety in my diet because of it. I’m so sick of eating the same things every day, and I’ve found it a lot easier to convince myself to skip meals because of it. I just want my taste and smell back to normal, like I’m seriously so desperate. I saw one of my grandmothers for the first time in 8 years the other week and she made a chocolate cake that I couldn’t eat because chocolate tastes like vodka. I haven’t had a cup of coffee in months because it tastes like what I imagine literal poop tastes like. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches are one of my favorite foods but I haven’t had one in months because peanut butter tastes like dog shit smells. I’ve been surviving on blueberry oatmeal and chamomile tea for the past month. Do you know how much oatmeal you can eat in a week????? I have so much oatmeal and I’m sick of it and I just wanna WANT TO eat again :(",,Request: ED difficulties due to long-term Covid symptoms,30,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,no7lve,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/no7lve/request_ed_difficulties_due_to_longterm_covid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/no7lve/request_ed_difficulties_due_to_longterm_covid/,1622367102,546,0,0,0,-1,1,Losing sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Avoiding certain foods due to their taste and smell, leading to a limited diet and difficulty finding variety, Feeling anxious and having to force-feed oneself due to lack of appetite, Emotional breakdowns and skipping meals due to the difficulty of finding safe foods, Feeling desperate to regain normal sense of taste and smell",Loss of sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Severe reduction in appetite due to the unpleasant taste and smell of most foods, Limited food options and difficulty finding safe foods to eat, Anxiety and emotional distress around feeling hungry, Difficulty maintaining variety in diet and skipping meals",Loss of sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Difficulty eating protein and other foods due to unpleasant taste and smell, Limited food choices causing lack of variety in diet, Anxiety and emotional distress related to feeling hungry, Forced to eat the same foods every day, leading to skipping meals"

Hello, Everyone!

I've never been diagnosed with an ED, but I'm curious if I have one developing, and I was wondering if you guy's could possibly give me some insight on the matter.

I've never been skinny, always on the ""chunky"" side. I was never bullied for my weight, but it's something I have always been very insecure about. A year ago I realized i gained alot, and was at my heaviest. I started intermittent fasting, lost some weight, and was feeling better, and it was never an issue. So Quarantine happened, and I gained some back. Well fast forward, I started intermittent fasting again, and I'm down to I would say an slightly above average weight? Idk, cuz I personally CAN NOT see a change in myself. i see the same person as before... blubber for days, but others have noticed, and keep giving me compliments. Saying ""you're looking so good!"" So i didn't before? ""What are you doing?! Omg, teach me your ways"" which in a sense makes me feel like they're envious of my weight loss (which i know sounds TERRIBLE, but that lowkey makes me feel good about myself), or people will make remarks about wanting to ""be my size"" which I'm not even that ""small"" when i look at myself?!

So to get to the point of this post, my intermittent fasting has turned into me just not eating some days, or if i do eat, i feel SO FUCKING GROSS and TERRIBLE that i just want to make myself throw up and cry. When i even think of eating lately, it makes me sad and disappointed in myself. I just want to be skinny. My boyfriend doesn't want me to lose anymore weight either, which sort of makes me mad. I'm not sure if i am going down an ED path, or if I'm just being too insecure about myself? I also don't want to tell my bf, friends, or family about this because i don't want them to try and make me eat more lol because i lowkey WANT this so i can be skinny, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE &amp; DOESN'T SEEM HEALTHY?!

Since young i have been fatshamed by a family member, even though i was at healthy weight. I became obsessed with my weight (however the weighing scale is now broken..) Its been a few years and i only eat one meal with a cup of milk on weekends (at home), however i am able to eat 3 meals at school (but no snacks) If given the choice, i would eat much lesser because i feel guilty eating, but my parents are strict and always forces me to eat full meals. Im not sure if i am just faking it because i think i am ok outside with friends etc, however there are instances where the sight of food made me cry and go into distress. Lately i keep having thoughts on purging too and im definitely not eating enough calories, sorry for messy post.. just in doubt of myself.. 
If it helps: i feel more stress at home than outside due to childhood issues, which may have contributed to it, but the thought of eating a snack to stop my hunger makes me sick and guilty.

526,526,EatingDisorders,"[ I've never posted in a Reddit community before, hopefully I do this correctly. Apologies in advance for the long vent post] CW - discussion of unhealthy eating habits, past abuse (mentioned briefly without detail)

Around 2018/2019 I was at an extremely high-point of stress in my life, and was eating very little. This negatively affected my health to the point where, when I finally did take a trip to my college's dining hall, I passed out in the middle of my food being prepared right in front of me. I can feel myself slowly regressing back to that point, isolating myself and feeling justified in treating myself badly, and I hate how closely I'm inching back towards that mindset. 

Currently I [20M] am taking a break from school and am unemployed (I have a job offer lined up that I'm really hoping works out for me, as I haven't been employed since August 2020 when I was forced to stop working while escaping my abusive household, and I've spent my time since recovering and seeking therapy). The issue surrounding food avoidance resurfaced for me a few months after settling into my new life, away from my abuse situation and in a shared apartment with roommates I care deeply for. I struggle with diagnosed anxiety, ADHD, major depressive disorder, and OCD, and these issues combined make it very difficult to motivate myself to eat, even when I know it's affecting my physical and mental health. My paranoia and anxiety has been at an all-time high again more recently for a multitude of reasons, and stress affects my appetite horribly. I also constantly battle with finding safe foods that I feel I can eat because of my ADHD, and in the past several months I've found myself unable to hyperfixate on any sort of food, which makes me feel completely unmotivated to attempt feeding myself at all. If it involves any sort of preperation I just won't eat, regardless of when I intend to eat said prepared meal. It feels like work that isn't worth it. I don't look forward to eating anything. The concept of just snacking makes me feel extremely guilty, like I'm doing something wrong and unhealthy when I graze, assuming I've actually gotten myself to snack on something without letting it go stale or moldy upon either no longer caring for said food or forgetting it exists entirely until it's too late. The only thing I actually enjoy consuming is coffee, which worsens my anxiety if it's the only thing I've had during the day, and it usually is. I feel guilty even adding more than a couple  drops of flavored creamer into my mug in the morning, as ingesting products with large amounts of sugar contribute hugely to my guilt surrounding food. 

At this point I can barely manage a meal a day, and if I have more than that it's usually a result of my roommates offering to buy me something, which only weighs heavier upon my ever-growing sense of guilt, especially when they often refuse to accept money to pay for my share of whatever dinner they've gotten delivered. I know their finances are only a little better than my own. It feels like I'm taking advantage of their kindness, or manipulating them into feeling bad and spending their hard-earned money on someone like me. I feel like I'm trapped in a horrible cycle. I'm always in a terrible mood and feel unbearable to be around. I've started isolating myself again. I'm sure my eating habits are a major factor in my negative mindset, but just being vaguely self-aware doesn't magically warp my eternal bad attitude out of existence, though I sure wish it did. I feel trapped in my own brain. I feel unlovable, like maybe being completely and doubtlessly valued is just genuinely something that's meant for some lucky people and not me. Like this is just how I'm fated to be as a person, and whatever greater purpose I want to think is out there doesn't even exist. I feel hopeless. I feel selfish for wanting more. I know my struggles with food are valid, but even assigning it the title of ""eating disorder"" feels like I'm taking something away from people with real problems. I feel lazy and childish and overdramatic for having so much difficulty with something that could be solved by simply eating something, anything, but if it doesn't sound at least semi-decent I can't force myself to do anything about it. At least addressing my food avoidance is somewhere to start, even if writing out this whole post so far has felt grossly theatrical, albeit extremely accurate to how I'm feeling. Addressing and my true feelings and revealing them to others is one of the most difficult tasks for me. I hate feeling vulnerable, or like my issues are a burden on others. I guess it feels good to identify my own emotions in a decently-worded manner. Writing this out was very difficult for me, so thank you for taking the time to read through my huge blocks of text, I do genuinely appreciate it. 

I'm looking for any advice this community can provide in regards to my post (neurodivergent-friendly food suggestions, similar experiences you've had to my own and how you've dealt with it, or anything else you think would helpful for me to read). Worth noting in case you have suggestions, I don't have any food allergies. I don't care for most sweet/dessert-y foods, but I find that I usually prefer salty and/or meat-centric meals. I don't dislike cooking generally, but the more time/effort something requires of me the more it significantly diminishes my general food-making motivation.

I’m 17. My whole life I’ve been underweight. I would skip breakfast and lunch because I had no time to prepare food and I’d only eat supper and wake up at 1am and eat my whole fridge. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and for that I had to eat 3 meals a day and establish a routine. I also got on depo provera that time. I quickly gained and am now overweight.. I stopped gaining weight once I stopped depo provera and now whenever I eat I feel nauseous?? Like yesterday it took me an hour to eat a bagel. Even when I’m hungry I have a hard time eating or I feel like my body is blocking me from taking in any food.. Like I’m repulsed by it.

Just last year I’d eat so much and all I could think about was food. I was in a bad relationship and the only thing I ever did was sleep and eat and if I ate something that didn’t satisfy me I’d get upset..

I’m 21 F, and I’m not sure if this is the place to post. I don’t count calories excessively, I don’t vomit, but a year ago I was a healthy weight with the goal of wanting to lose some. And I’ve had a really stressful time at uni this year and it’s made me just stop eating. I knew I have lost lots of weight (I think it still be in the healthy weight category just about) and I feel great in my body, but my house mate commented the other day on how I don’t seem to eat anything and I decided to add up everything I’ve eaten in the past few days and it’s barely anything. Not sure if I am allowed to put numbers of calories in here.

I am hungry a lot of the time but I honestly just don’t notice it. It’s something I’ve recognised before but I decided it made me feel better because I don’t have any bloating from food and I feel like I’m accomplishing something. I’ve just started seeing someone and I don’t want to be conscious of my belly around her when she sees me, and I just feel better in myself in general so I just forget about being hungry. I had some fitness goals but I haven’t exercised in a long time because I’ve been so busy with uni work. So I don’t feel weak or tired from the not eating, but I don’t feel strong anymore (I had some muscle from when I did Muay Thai for 5 years but now I feel physically weak muscle wise) and I want to change that.

Basically, I read this story about someone who was in a calorie deficit for a long time and when they tried to gain muscle they found they had to gain weight because they had “ruined” their metabolism, and it made me so scared because I’d never thought about it before but clearly I’ve been in a massive calorie deficit for so long I feel like if I start eating “normal” I’m going to gain weight and I really don’t want to. I feel good about my body for the first time but I also feel so unhealthy. Am I encouraging an unhealthy relationship with food in myself? How do I fix it without gaining back all the weight I’ve lost?

I follow lots of fitspo accounts in the hopes I’ll be motivated to be fit and they all say that you should eat well, but ALSO you have to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. But I feel like I’ve taken that to the extreme, especially since I don’t have any time to work out (exam season).

534,534,EatingDisorders,"I’m 3 years recovered from my ED, and while I have a relatively okay relationship with food now, I still find food description words extremely uncomfortable to say or hear. I feel physically sick when I hear people use words like ‘delicious’ or ‘tasty’. Even typing them makes me feel uncomfortable, and I haven’t said them verbally in probably 10 years. On top of that, I also have an extreme fear of saying the names of certain foods, as well as hearing other people use them. This hasn’t been a huge problem in the past, but now that I’ve voiced to my friends and family what my trigger words are in an attempt to make them understand that they still have to be mindful even though I’m recovered, they feel the need to say them over and over ‘as a joke’ because i end up getting sick and having to excuse myself. I guess it’s just funny to them. I am fully aware that my triggers aren’t anyone else’s problem, but there’s a difference between them being able to speak freely about food around me, and saying trigger words over and over to make me uncomfortable. However, with that being said, I’d much rather get over the triggers than have to argue with my friends and family over respecting the fact that doing this is uncomfortable for me. Uncomfortable is also an understatement but I don’t know what other word use to describe the feeling. 

So, is this a problem that anyone else has ? And if it is, how do you get over/cope with it ?

I’ve been trying to induce vomiting for the past 2 hours and I’m losing my shit and I don’t know what to fucking do. 

I broke down crying when I realized that and I just don’t know what to do I told myself that it’d be fine because I did it once or twice months ago that it wouldn’t be an issue

I saw a my reflection which made me do this. I felt I ate too much this morning

I DONT EVEN KNOW MY FUCKING WEIGHT that’s the asinine nature of it all too

Because I’m in a motor chair and can’t stand I need a special device to be weighed and good luck finding one in state with this shit infrastructure and healthcare (USA)

I can’t tell my partner bc she makes dumb fucking comments about me being hot in response to this. Or that I simply shouldn’t entrain those thoughts

I need to not tell her or my only friend because I just need to have my shit together and I simply don’t

My other friend has an ED and I don’t want to bother him because I wasn’t the best support for him. I know that now all too late. I realized today that a year ago how he brought it up once and I made a “ you need to aim for a healthy weight “ comment. I know I meant well I just.....I wish I could apologize He’s never brought it up since

For context. He said he was happy he reached —lbs (which was very underweight . )He said he knew he shouldn’t have been but wanted to share

He’s not proana. I just wish I said something better. That wouldn’t trigger or enable but show support

I can check the search to see how best to apologize to him

I wonder If bringing up the situation to apologize for would end up triggering him...

Reading one advice post regarding the holidays bothered me “Focus on your heart not hips” and my friend probably felt just as patronized when I said to focus on healthy stuff

Reading that line just made me want to self harm my hips lol

I don’t know if I have an ED or not I really don’t want one

I don’t know if I’m pretending it’s okay or if I’m just on some dicey line and there’s time to get out

I know though. I know I have something wrong and I don’t know how to fix it. 5 years ago I self harmed over drinking too much soda and 2 years ago I went a week eating nothing but sunflower seeds and freaking out over their calorie count

I did ask my friend a year ago because I noticed I had issue with eating . And he recommended to force eat something you really really like. And I tried that a number of times with no luck

Because of the anxiety I have around eating I just try to avoid thinking about or I lose appetite. I’ve tried exercising and did it to the point of using it as a method of self harm

I’ve tried dieting and did it to the point of eating nothing but seeds until I passed out

I can’t even ignore it because now I’m going to have to avoid every thought about my body or I’m going to lose my shit because I’m that fucking incompetent

I hardly eat. And when I do it’s sugar and carbs and I’m stressed it’s sugar and carbs and I’m always fucking stressed

I’m 22 btw. I asked my PCP for referrals to dietitian a month ago and was told the dietitian would call me back. Twice....no call

We are both 14 and she's been trying not to eat since she was 11. some random guy called her fat and she says that this started all. since 2021 started her mom has been making comments on her when she eats like ""you are eating too much"", ""you are gaining weight"", etc. when she's around with other people she has to eat so she does it but when shes alone sometimes tries to avoid it. she drinks water and smoke to calm hunger and a few times tried to vomit but she couldn't. she told her mom that her comments were hurting her and that she has been struggling to eat but her mom just got mad. she also self harms and wanted to kill herself a few times but luckily she never tried it. her parents don't believe in therapy. after a lot of months of pushing they finally sent her with a therapist but after a month they stopped because ""it won't fix anything"" and ""it's a waste of money and time"". we've been together for a few months and I've been trying to be the most supportive I can for her. yesterday she told me about her eating problems.

553,553,EatingDisorders,"Hi.
I (53F) have struggled with various eating disorders from the time I was about eight years old. It's mostly been BED, with periods of severe restriction especially in my 20s and 30s. I finally sought help at the end of 2019 and spent four months in an intensive outpatient program at a highly-regarded eating disorders clinic. It helped tremendously, especially with ""fat acceptance"". Some of the best lessons I learned were that food is just fuel, there are no ""bad"" foods, and ""fat"" is just an adjective. When I left the program, I had tools under my belt and a new outlook.
And then the pandemic hit. Along with the isolation and the toxic positivity that is thrown at essential workers (I am one) and some severe mental health struggles my kid was having that were leading to rages and abuse, the binges came back -- not quite full-bore, but close.
I have been excusing my binges by comparing them to worse binges I've had in the past. I keep hanging on to ""fat acceptance"" and the fact that I am the fat girl who baffles doctors with her perfect blood pressure and perfect cholesterol and perfect A1C. Thing is, it's gotten to the point where my weight is affecting my health now. I am at the highest weight I have ever been in my life. My feet and lower back hurt all. the. time. My stomach is starting to get in the way of sex. I took my dog out for a walk yesterday and it took 20 minutes to walk less than half a mile. Five years ago, I was walking 20-30 miles a week.
I spent so many years hating my body. Treatment got me to love my body again. Now I am having a hard time reconciling the fact that I need to take action to be kind to my body against the old tapes that are telling me that any sort of modification, tracking, or restriction of food intake means that I hate my body.

Like physically i’ve recovered i never dropped to a dangerous weight even though i lost a lot of weight. i didn’t gain the weight back but i don’t think i will unless my eating gets completely out of control again. and that’s the thing my eating doesn’t feel out of control it is relatively normal but it still feels like i have an ed. previously i would starve myself so i could feel hungry i wouldn’t eat unless it was a certain time all while i was exercising a ton. now i’m not doing those things anymore i’m eating what i want to and i don’t track calories anymore because what i want to eat isn’t always unhealthy but i still feel like i have an ed like my mindset is still there. idk if this makes sense but like i still think about restricting and how i don’t exercise as much and how im probably eating more than i was when i was exercising a ton and how much i miss being hungry. im worried that feeling like this will cause a relapse or a binge and i didn’t think i wanted that to happen cause i wanted to recover but the thoughts make me think i kinda do and it scares me.

556,556,eating_disorders,"hey, i just wanted to say that this is in no way meant to be a harmful post, i just really want to reach out and ask you if anyone else feels that way:

i was overweight as a child, i ate my feelings because my parents weren‘t there for me for some time (i was 10 i think, my mum had a miscarriage). my mum was depressed, which is understandable, but i was not really feeling the same. i always loved my mum and needed time with her, but when she was not always there for me, i would just cry and / or eat.

i gained a lot if weight really quickly and my body couldn‘t take it, so i got a bunch of stretch marks, which im still rly insecure about.

when i was about to turn 13, i was really depressed (i have had these phases of rly bad depressed feelings since i was 10), so i decided to loose a lot of weight. i started to count my calories and wouldn’t eat more than like more than 400 a day. i lost over 50 lbs in 3-4 months and was pretty skinny. 
ppl were worried because i looked sick, i just lost too much way too fast. my hair fell out, i was pale and didn‘t have energy at all. 
it got so bad that on my 13th birthday i cried because of the cake, i thought it had way too many calories and i would gain the weight that i had lost at that point back.

so this was some time ago, im about to turn 15 now. my disordered eating got better after a few months, before i was 14, i was already kind of okay again. i didn‘t gain weight back after loosing it in such an unhealthy way, but this year i had to change schools because i am now in highschool. i hated the school a lot at first, and i got back into the habit of eating my feelings. i gained 18 lbs since school started this year and in november i decided to loose weight and be skinny again.

in december i started to starve myself again because i wanted to be skinny again as fast as possible. i don‘t have patience at all, so if i want to loose weight, it has to be as fast as possible. i lost 12 lbs again until now and i want to loose a bit more still. i am pretty good at not eating during the day, which of course helps me loose weight, but not in a healthy way at all. i have lots of willpower when it comes to starving, and i don‘t think i look way to fat anymore. 

but i have had this „problem“ lately:
i feel like fat ppl anger me.
i can‘t understand this feeling at all but i am feeling this way since december. 
they make me feel bad for them, knowing they can‘t really feel good about their body.
when i was fat i would cry a lot about it and my self esteem was non-existent. 
now when i see fat ppl, i get physically angry and i have to calm down. 
they make me feel fat too. i hated the mentality i had when i was fat and i feel like these fat people remind me of myself and how much i hated my body.
i have a rly overweight girl in my class and sometimes when i see her in the morning, i want to just simply punch her in the face because i get so frustrated and annoyed at all the fat on her body and face.
this is such a weird thing to feel and i can‘t control it. 

i am also a person who cries a lot to let out their anger. so sometimes at school i just have to go to the bathroom and lock myself in there because i feel like i might start crying infront of everyone and need to just calm down.
i hate looking at fat people, but i can‘t understand why. i was fat myself for a few years, so i feel like its something else than a person who has always been thin saying this.
i understand how you feel about being fat yourself, abd i was bodyshamed and knew what orher people were thinking about the way i looked.

but now, i have this hatred for rly fat people too. i hate myself for feeling this way, but i feel so helpless about it. i don‘t know if i hate looking at them because i know how much i hated being overweight, because i‘m afraid i will gain the weight back (literally my biggest fear), or beacuse i just turned into a bad person and i can‘t stop projecting my insecurities onto them.
i am not overweight right now, so why do i starve myself right now to loose weight, but they won‘t?? they are the ones who shouldn‘t eat, thats what i think, i get so angry about my brain hating my body so much that i just wont eat. but they always do and they have these flaps of fat on their ugly bodies and faces.

i know i shouldn‘t feel this way, but why do i then? 
btw my parents aren‘t thin either, but i don‘t feel this hatred for them, just for people i don‘t know personally, i really love my mum and dad:)
overweight teenagers are the fat people i hate the most, especially fat girls. 
i feel like i have to throw up sometimes when i see them.
i feel so bad saying this, because i was once fat myself, love some overweight people dearly, and am really afraid i might gain weight back again.
does anyone else have this feeling in them? it just gets worse when i am starving myself and see a fat person, i just have so much anger in me being constantly hungry, i am frustrated and i even scream at my friends sometimes over the smallest things they said.

I have been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now with on and off recovery which never lasts long.

In 2020 when covid hit i gained a bit of weight and became depressed then developed and ED, I have told my bsf about it and tbh she was not very understanding of it, she is one of those people who think its my chice and i could just eat. I obv can't change someone's thoughts and believes so i never really bothered. later that year i decided to start recovery and i mentioned it to her, while all my family were supportive of this decision, one time i was showing her my breakfast ( we used to send each other daily vlogs and stuff) and mentioning how I'm starting to be healthier and bla bla bla, she them replied back with ""OH MY GOD! You eat sooo much food wow, that's probably as much as my brother, wow."" This was the most triggering thing someone ever commented on my food. the thing is my ""big"" breakfast was too hard boiled eggs, 2 low carb crackers and a bunch of veggies...

i felt sooooo guilty and i believed that it is too much and always been afraid to eat like that in fear of being perceived like so. Anyways, needless to say that it made me relapse immediately and honestly thinking of recovering is never serious as it was back then.

The thing here is , she knows I've relapsed and i never really talked about my ed with her ever since. However, she still to this day says the most triggering things ever. Like ''Oh, i haven't eaten since yesterday."" ""I haven't eaten for 24hrs"" ""I only had tea for breakfast"" and so more of these, the thing is she does not have an ed... she just likes to brag like some of those people, and she knows that i have an ed and she still brags to me.

she sometimes checks on me if i ate or not and all that but it doesn't really differ when i know that she believes I'm pathetic and ""its all my choice""

We have food but it’s only ingredients. I hate cooking because I wasn’t really taught how to cook.

She just buys fast food or we eat out then she gets angry on how much money we’re spending to eat out. Why should I (the child) have to be cooking for us? She has pointed out my weight gain. I went from thin to overweight and she doesn’t understand that I used to be so skinny because my relationship with food is bad and I debate doing it again because it will make me skinny because it worked last time. I tried cutting sodas but it tastes so good and she gave me these quotes to put on my wall that say &gt;!don’t wish for it, work for it!&lt; And &gt;!once you see results, it becomes an addiction!&lt; And she basically enables me. She gets angry that I’m so picky. I debate just counting calories and “fasting” at this point to lose weight and cut sodas out. She won’t cook and when she does she won’t clean the dishes and will just leave them there. I’m a parentified child. I listen to her vents and I I give her advice and I listen to her problems all the time. I’ve made her meals before and when she gets sick I’ll bring her medicine and make sure she gets rest. I make sure the house is cleaned but it’s so hard to stay on top of it when I have destructive dogs and a mother to clean up after. Then I have my own room and school work to stay on top of or else she will be angry my grades are so bad. I have to take all the “blows” when she’s angry or sad or mad at someone else or grumpy. She blames me for so much. She doesn’t understand how hard it is and I told her I was starving myself and she didn’t seem too bothered at all. She uses stuff from the past against me and brushes everything off. I just want to starve all this weight off. I guess I just have to wait till I can move out to be happy.

I might have possible mixed up the word petite and skinny as I said it in a non native tongue. I have also on several occasions told her that she's the perfect size. She recently asked me if I liked the hip/stomach gap and I said yes - it was a few days after this she told me that it was risky being with me because of my preferences. She's never corrected me or told me that something was triggering her or making her feel bad. I was so shocked!  


I love my girlfriend like no one I've ever met, she is amazing. I'd date her no matter what she looked like, and have told her as much. But she is exactly what I look for in a girl. It feels like she's mad at me for being attracted to her. Sure I do like petite girls, but she is and has always been pretty much this size.  Other than the comments above we never had a discussion about what I like, we never talked about what my exes  look like, what actresses I like, that there is limit, that someone can be too skinny - shes just come to some conclusion about what I like without really involving me. We've never talked about that I have plenty of things I'm physically attracted to about her.  That the ""underwear gap"", thing is like 1 of 20 things that I find sexy in women. It looks like my relationship is starting to fall apart because of this, she's eating less and less and pushing me away. She's also had a horrible year with all sorts of family problems, death, job issues etc. So I don't know how much of this is me and how much is everything else.

571,571,eating_disorders,"I repeat: TW for numbers, cals, weight, anything on the book. I am STRUGGLING.

IDK if this is the right place but here it goes. okay so basically to get straight to it, i’m pretty sure I’ve developed an eating disorder and I’m not quite sure what to do about it. I think i’ve always struggled with disordered eating habits (mostly from my teen years), but since i’ve never really been uw and have mostly been overweight for most of my life no one’s really bat an eye about my weight habits. my yearly cycles mostly consisted of restricting a couple of months and then binging the next couple, if that makes sense. 

That was basically my life up until two or three years ago, when my mom kicked me out of my house and my eating habits went all over the place. i had just graduated high school and had also started smoking weed like 24/7 (and at the time i didn’t think it was anything cus yk i was ignorant and caught up in my emotional problems) which i honestly believe triggered some kind of BED in me. Like, at first, it was just having the “munchies”, but soon after i spiraled out of control and even if i wasn’t high, i’d eat so uncomfortably much that i’d just feel sick by the end of it. I would hide food so no one would eat it in random spots, I’d make sure no one saw any trash that could be related to my binging sessions and it was honestly a whole mess. I decided to blame it all on COVID and being stuck home all day and my depression which was out of control as well. But never an ED.

So, when my mom kicked me out, i moved out across the country basically to live with my grandparents, and DID try to get on a healthy diet, but it just wasn’t working for me and i fell back into my restricting/binging cycle from years before again. It was like this for 1 year. I put on an extreme amount of weight (i’ve never in my life gotten to that point and it was making me desperate) and something inside me just kind of clicked and that’s when i think i’ve been engaging in full ED behavior. 

For this past year, i’ve been punishing myself basically by restricting as much as possible. I’d only break this habit whenever i’d get drunk, which was another problem for me because i think i was giving myself a drinking problem, because when i drink, i DRINK, ok. It was bad. But i’d start to use my drunkenness as a mean to binge, but then purge soon after with the excuse that my stomach just became upset from drinking. Even I believed it in the beginning. All of this, however, was occasional, so I never cared either and it wasnt affecting my weight at all, tbh. I was still gaining weight.

Then comes my 20th birthday. I became so sick of myself, of this person i was now. Of my body. Of how people treat me because of my weight. I couldn’t go a single day without someone reminding me of my weight and of how i looked (mostly family members). I am fed up. I started comparing myself (CONSTANTLY) to my friends, my sister, cousins, and everyone who i deemed prettier than me because they were all beautiful and skinny and set my mind on losing weight for this upcoming year. I’m not going to continue being so insecure about my weight. I'm going to change this about myself. i want to be someone who people will show off and feel proud about. 

So, around december, i went full crazy on this thing. I started purging every meal i ate, i’ve become obsessed with my calorie intake, and i just cant stop weight checking myself or body checking anymore. I told myself that after a week or so, i’d stop, but i’ve become so happy with the outcome of this that i can’t seem to actually stop. Everyone praises me for my weight loss. I’ve managed to lose a big amount of weight already in a month. And everyone is so proud of me for this, so it really doesn’t help me at all to try to stop. Christmas was horrible and new Years eve as well. I only broke my diet on Christmas, but i’d never purged so much in a single day, and i just felt so sick of myself. 

It’s gotten so far up my ass that i can’t think about anything other than losing weight. When i went full-time, it started out with at least eating twice a day, so long as i didn’t go over my calorie limit, yk. But after like 2 weeks, i started enjoying the hunger. There’s days where i’ll eat maybe a rice cake, or only a supplement protein shake and call it a day. Eating disgusts me. All i can think about when i see food is how quickly I’m going to have to purge it when i’m done eating it. I cant eat with people around, because i feel like they can see me gag down my food, because the disgust and nausea becomes overwhelming now most times. If i feel full off a meal, it’s game over; there’s no way i won’t throw it up. I’m always feeling lightheaded and dizzy, even though i make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day. Being hungry is not really a discomfort anymore, it’s become comforting. I’m starting to become obsessed with how many calories i burn in a day (i have an apple watch that is helping feed into this 😹) or how many steps i take, but i am rather lazy so i’m not sure if i’ll put up with it for too long. I’ve been obsessing over that stupid BMI chart too, and i can’t stop checking when i will reach my healthy weight (currently 162 lbs but i’m barely 5’0 so you know 😭) on the chart and it’s driving me up a wall. I went to a doctor the other day because i’ve been getting sick with weird shit that i’ve never caught before (I blame it on my immune system being ass bc well YA KNO but ive started taking vitamins) and saw that i was considered obese (I know this sounds rough, but being considered that for me is like horrible, I've always been bullied for my weight so please bare with me) and almost had a stroke in the waiting room. And this was when I was already losing crazy weight because i was like 169 lbs for that, and i started my weight loss at almost 190 😭. It was a nightmare knowing where i stand on the BMI chart. 

there’s probably so much more i could add to this, but i don’t want to make this too long LOL. I do wanna apologize i don’t want to offend anyone because i know that the way i speak about myself can be harsh or triggering to others, but this is genuinely how i feel and i need to rip this bandaid off ASAP because i feel out of control and don’t know where to go. I know i’m kinda fat phobic, but this is genuinely just to myself because i honestly don’t give two shits about how other people look. i only care about how i look and want to look, if that makes sense, so again sorry if it comes off wrong, i don’t mean it for others, just towards myself. 

i’ve been doing my share of research on the topic, but i honestly don’t know what to do with any of the information except just sit there, like, ok i think i have an ED, so what now? yk what i mean 😹 I don't really know why I'm writing this. I guess I'm just looking for comfort in knowing that there's others like me that have been thru this or going thru it. I've reached out to friends and they all understand (but I don't want to be a trigger for them because they've also fallen pretty deep into this in the past) and I've talked with my sister but I just feel alone all the time because no one seems to really understand like the obsession that I have over losing weight and feeling beautiful again.",,ok this is a long rant//kind of cry for help but TW on almost everything pls,1,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,10djfai,1,jelicadelacruz,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/10djfai/ok_this_is_a_long_rantkind_of_cry_for_help_but_tw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/10djfai/ok_this_is_a_long_rantkind_of_cry_for_help_but_tw/,1673887718,1419,0,0,0,-1,1,"Restricting calorie intake, purging after meals, obsession with weight loss, negative body image and self-talk, becoming obsessed with calorie intake and BMI chart, feeling lightheaded and dizzy, discomfort with eating, and becoming comfortable with hunger",harmful,"Experiencing physical symptoms such as lightheadedness and dizziness, discomfort with eating, and feeling constantly hungry and obsessed with calorie intake and BMI chart, Experiencing negative self-talk and a negative body image, Feeling alone and misunderstood by others, Becoming increasingly isolated from others due to discomfort with eating and fear of being seen eating, Feeling a sense of comfort from hunger","Restricting calorie intake, purging after every meal, obsessing over calorie intake, BMI, and weight loss, feeling disgusted by food, becoming obsessed with hunger and calorie-burning, developing a fear of eating around others",harmful,"Experiencing physical discomfort such as lightheadedness and dizziness, feeling alone and misunderstood, becoming increasingly fat-phobic, Receiving praise and validation for weight loss is reinforcing the behavior, Feeling out of control and unsure of what to do","History of disordered eating habits, smoking weed, BED, drinking problem, weight gain, negative comments on weight, body checking, calorie counting, purging after meals, obsession with weight loss, BMI chart",harmful,"Feelings of disgust and nausea when eating, unable to eat with others, comfort in hunger, lightheadedness and dizziness, obsession with calorie intake and weight loss, negative body image, being considered obese on the BMI chart causing distress"

**Sorry rant.**

Note: my ED is due to limited diet due to medical problems. Inability to eat and GI issues. 

I use to be very obese due to a few medical issues. Got them treated. Even prior to that I was slowly working on losing weight. 

When I got near my goal which was the top portion of normal for my BMI I dropped that weight very fast in about 4 months. Not intentionally. I was working out a lot. Strength training with marathon length walks and severely limiting my calories (1200- short person). For my height it wasn't that low but my doctor did get concerned. 

At my lowest/goal I was considered normal for my BMI but I had a very low body fat percentage I'm assuming because I was very boney. Cheeks, collar bones, hips, ribs above and below all stuck out. Strangers started calling me mean names. This was the top portion of normal BMI for my height but I did look severe. My periods were scarce. Blood work was good. 

I have health problems that make it hard to eat, digest, taste, and smell. I don't like a lot of foods and have a very restricted diet. I was eating and very healthy. 

I wasn't necessarily interventioned but my family would cry, beg me to eat, and show me pictures of people with anorexia. My partner at the time would say things like ""I use to anorexic"" and also show me pics. Random people and family would try to feed me. I was eating but it was difficult, unpleasant, and sometimes painful. 

I gained a good 10lbs back. That I needed. I had previously gotten injured trying to lift a 40lb bag. I took on a job that required me to routinely lift half my weight and I need to put on some mass. 

I gained a good healthy 20-30lbs of mostly muscle. I then frequently received negative comments about how I'm ""gaining weight"" ""filling out"" ""need to lay off the snacks"" amongst other rude comments. However- when I was at my ""normal"" I was so weak I wouldn't have been able to perform my job. I was reasonably fit and extremely muscular. My doctor was perfectly okay with where I was at so long as labs are good and I feel good. 

Turns out- my medical condition was flaring up and I needed a medication adjustment- it's been a year we are still working on it. I'm now over weight again. But also lost most of my strength due to my condition. 

One of my not so well meaning family members is into the whole ""keto"" thing. I cannot do keto. My doctor said NO. My medication bottle says no I will get sick. I've explained that with my condition I need a specific diet for my medicine to work properly. 

High protein, high calorie, high simple carbs, low fat, low fiber. 

Despite me explaining this and sharing resources, and me kindly saying I'm glad that works for you please don't comment on my diet. 

It did not cease and it then became- bro you also have an ED you should talk to your doc about it, if you want to improve your appearance go workout, stop picking at my diet, you're underweight for your height and leave me the F- alone. They don't make these comments to other family members. They were not present when I was bone thin. 

I know the way I called them out wasn't appropriate but I'm not tolerating it. Comments like ""you need to lay off the sugar"" ""that's bad for you"" ""glad you're finally quitting the sugar"" ""try this product (that's definitely not safe for me)""

 I occasionally get low blood sugar and have had severe falls. No- I'm going to stay alive thanks! With my GI issues it became so hard to eat if it wasn't ultra processed or pure sugar everything hurt and I'd spend hours laying down in pain. It's getting better. 

I am working on getting down to a healthy weight- in a healthy manner this time. I've been very ill for about 4 months. I cannot afford to lose my strength or muscle mass. 

But it's extremely irritating. The negative comments no matter what weight I'm at. When people pick at what I eat and how I got treated when I was at a healthy weight but also a ""normal"" weight. 

I can't eat or cook around people and I'm very defensive about my food. I don't enjoy eating out or any function involving food especially with my restrictions. 

Its one thing when people give me food but partners have tried to hand mouth feed me and others have kept (my) food from me. My food!

575,575,eating_disorders,"(TW: throwing up, choking, rapid weight loss, exact number mentioned)

  
I have ARFID. I have trouble eating and I often forget to eat at all. I usually only eat dinner cuz it’s routine and everyone else eats dinner so I do too. I’ve only been diagnosed for a few months, but I’ve had the disorder for years, at least since 6th grade, and I’m in 11th. I used to throw up food after I ate it, but not because I wanted to. I would choke and it would come back up.

I don’t remember to eat 90% of the time, when I’m reminded a majority of the time I *don’t* want to. Sometimes the thought of trying to eat makes me gag. The idea of choking down food and forcing it down my throat terrifies me. I’m seeing an Occupational Therapist, and she asked me why I wanted to change.  


The answer is, I don’t. My friends and family are getting really concerned with how thin I’m getting. I’m rapidly losing weight. I went in for a doctor’s appointment on October 12th, and I weighed 125 pounds. We went back in on November 15th and I weighed 119 pounds. That’s 6 pounds in just as many weeks. I don’t even want to know how much I weigh now. I’ll look through my camera roll and see images of myself from a month or so ago and do a double take.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t want to change though, I don’t care. I like myself the way I am and it’s not hurting me. My friends keep telling me I’m going to end up in the hospital, my mom is getting increasingly worried and I just don’t care anymore.

Whilst I was eating she kept looking at my plate, then when I finished she said ""you've eaten all that"".

All them comments made me feel guilty and that I ate too much even though everybody else portions were bigger than mine. I guess the elderly don't understand/think that those types of comments can really affect someone that struggles with food.

So I've been skinny my whole life and I used to hate being called thin or ""skin and bones"" but as I got older i realized that most of my identity to others comes from being thin. But i still hate being called skinny. Not because I don't want to be skinny, but because I don't feel like I'm being praised for something I've earned. I'm petite because that's my body type, not because I exercise or use self-discipline. And don't get me wrong, I wish my thighs were narrower and my stomach is definitely flat, and people DO perceive me as underweight, even though I'm not quite there yet. But when people call me skinny I can only think ""They do not realize this isn't even close. I am skinny to them (because I was born this way).

603,603,eating_disorders,"Hello.  
I can't make an appointment at my docs to speak to them about my binge eating dissorder, it's been getting worse and worse but for half a year I can't book an appointment with a GP. Could really go with some advice if anyone has any.   


I was raised on junkfood and have always been a binge eater; stress is a trigger, but I will binge eat to some degree without any trigger. I can have food cravings that will be on the front of my mind the entire day, and distractions do not help.  
I can't seem to stop myself binge eating and I will very easily eat double my reccomended calory intake every single day and I am unable to stop myself. It's easy for me to access it becuase I have a shop next to my house and my family member will buy me junk food even though I ask them not to....  


It's gotten really bad the last few years. I have a medical condition that makes me gain weight a bit faster than most people and that is really making this harder. I have an active job; on my feet 8+ hours a day, but I can eat 800 calories and still gain weight.   


My binges are usually me just continuouly inhaling all types of unhealthy foods for hours and in large quanitities.   
I have REALLY been needing to get some help becuase recently I have been making myself throw up on an almost daily basis, or everytime I eat junk food or a lot of calories. I used to fast for hours/days but I am no-longer able to keep myself doing that, plus I will feint if I go without food for too long.   


I have been trying to fight my binging by:  
\- Allowing myself to binge : I don't ever stop....for months I don't get bored of these foods.   
\- Drinking more water.  
\- Eating ice.   
\- HUGE meals : I just binge anyway.   
\- Varied diet or strict diet   
\- More protein or fiber or content.   
\- Only filling my bowl : I just refill the bowl.   
\- Distractions/keeping busy  
\- Sugar-free   
\- Protein shakes and soups  


I REALLY want to get help and honestly not being able to reach my doctor has made this way worse. I feel so much more depressed and helpless everyday now. My doc will only take appointments at 8am and EVERYONE in town calls at 8am, I am working at that time and now allowed my phone or allowed to take an hour to wait on hold. They say "" try out online appointments we put up at midnight"" ; but after over a month of setting alarms to wake up at midnight, I NEVER saw an appointment.   
I feel so helpless. I called mind and a few other helplines a few times but all they can offer me is a chat and infomation on mindfullness and medication...Which don't work for me on unrealted reasons.",,Does anyone have any tips for tackeling an almost impossible to stop binger?,1,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,zmvkh1,1,Shinigami_Sadies,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/zmvkh1/does_anyone_have_any_tips_for_tackeling_an_almost/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/zmvkh1/does_anyone_have_any_tips_for_tackeling_an_almost/,1671137103,501,0,0,0,-1,1,Difficulty in accessing medical help for binge eating disorder,harmful,"Feeling helpless and depressed due to inability to access medical help, Making myself throw up on an almost daily basis, Trying various techniques to fight binging but not finding success","Difficulty accessing medical care, raised on junk food, stress is a trigger for binge eating, having food cravings, easy access to junk food, family member buying junk food despite being asked not to, medical condition that makes weight gain easier",harmful,"Binge eating has been getting worse and worse, unable to stop binge eating and easily exceeds recommended calorie intake, Recent development of purging behavior, Attempts to fight binge eating by allowing themselves to binge, trying different diets, and seeking help through helplines have not been successful",Difficulty accessing medical care for binge eating disorder,harmful,"Unable to receive medical help for worsening binge eating disorder, Feeling depressed and helpless due to inability to access care"
604,604,eating_disorders,"Hi. I'm 18 F, almost 19.

So I'm kind of nervous about the next month. I'm moving back home from college fir winter break and I've had my eating patterns set and I've been in a sort of routine that I will change for a day, I've done that about 3 times in the last 4 months that I've lived at college, and I am scared about how they will be affected when I go back home. 

I have been aware of my eating disorder since I was 14 and I've been dealing with it for the past 4 almost 5 years. I know I have ednos. I have pica when I was a child for about 7 years. 

I'm mainly afraid of what I'm going to do when I go back home because my mother and older sister kind if just do what they want which I don't care about, but that also means that I will either come home to a pantry full of foods that are very unhealthy or super high in sodium and sugar, or I'll go home a a completely empty pantry and fridge. 

Since I am going gone for winter break, that means we will have a Christmas dinner at my own home then go to my grandparents house for dinner with them and I can never really get over my nerves when there because my grandfather has always made comments on my body and my sisters body since I was about 12 and her 16. I know my sister doesn't pay much mind to it, but I am so scares of him commenting on my body.

I looked at my mom for support but she just looked at me and gave me a ""you know he's right"" look. My dad backed me up and told my brother to not talk to me like that and that'd I'd be fine.

I also stood my ground and ordered the cake anyway. It was supposed to be such a happy thing but it feels like a lump in my stomach now. I'm holding in tears on the way home, all I can think about is how my family thinks I'm fat too.

622,622,eating_disorders,"I have always been insecure about my weight. The first time I can remember being self conscious about my body was when I was probably 8 or 9 years old. My friend and I were about to go swimming and her stepdad poked my stomach and told me I had “fat rolls”.

All throughout high school I was quite thin. I played sports, but still obsessed over my eating and struggled with bulimia. Once I got to college, I gained about 50 pounds over a 4 year span. I was completely out of control. My weight absolutely consumed my life and I felt so low. It was all I could think about, but I just kept gaining weight. Finally, I had enough. In July I started a diet and really stuck to it. I was losing weight really fast and became obsessed with it. To the point where I was barely eating and losing half a pound to a pound a day. I wasn’t having my period, losing my hair, irritable, etc. I ended up losing about 40 pounds in 3 months. I was getting a lot of “you look skinny” “you look like you’ve lost weight” “you look really good!” Which just fueled the fire, I became obsessed with people noticing I was losing weight. I was supposed to lose 20 more pounds to reach my weight loss goal, but I lost the self discipline. The last 2 months I have maybe lost 7 pounds. The thought of losing more weight has consumed my life. It has never been this bad. It’s all I can think about. If I don’t eat for a day, I look in the mirror and think about how skinny I look. If I eat a meal and feel like it was too much, I look in the mirror and I think I look overweight again. I know it’s my mind playing tricks, but I hate how my mind effects what I see in the mirror. It is effecting my relationship with my boyfriend my family. I hate this relationship I have with food and how it’s all I can think about.

624,624,eating_disorders,"Welp I guess were here now. I just realized a lot of things. For context, my girlfriend suffers from bulimia and it got worse recently. We have talked a lot about it, as much as she allowed to. We talked about what we can do together to minimize her binging and part of that was not to buy snacks when we meet up, which we did a lot. We bought so many snacks and sugary food and we both ate a lot. 
Heads up: I don't understand everything and I'm trying to understand bulimia, but I'm not there yet. I'm not dealing with this in a healthy way, which I'm gonna have therapy for.
The thought that wanders my mind constantly is: just stop purging. Stupid, right? Why am I thinking that. Why does it seem so easy to me? Bc I don't purge. Huh. Wait...I was binging together with her. Huh. I guess I was happy about it bc I didn't feel alone. Damn, I was eating so fucking much when I was younger, up until in my twenties. It only stopped for now bc my medicine kills my appetite. Damn, I check all the boxes for binge eating when I am stuck and I defend my actions, I'm really mad when someone talks about my eating. And stopping binging with her makes me sad? Wtf. Welp, I think I got to the bottom of a lot of things today. 
The thing is, for someone who gave up on loosing weight and just who just stopped caring, it's hard to hear how my girlfriend and her best friend (also bulimic) talks about gaining weight. They're terrified. And there I am, an overweight person with the body fat they are terrified of. I know it's selfish, they told me it's just about themselves and not others. I think it triggered that sad little girl who was bullied for her weight and constantly shamed for gainig weight. Suddenly I'm terrified too. Here's the thing tho which terrifies me: I stopped eating. Due to stress I suffer from extreme nausea which prevents me from eating. But, I stopped getting hungry, and not eating doesn't make me feel more ill. I keep trying out how long I can go without eating. Why is this happening. I want to nourish my body but it doesn't work. I'm working against it. I'm honestly terrified. I guess I didn't overcome my own disordered eating, yet my girlfriend has it worse and I want to help her.

626,626,eating_disorders,"I hate eating disorders. I hate subs and pages and people that encourage it. I’ve dealt with an eating disorder since i was 12 and it has never left. I can never get rid of it. It’s like a body eating and mind eating parasite that infects. I hate how eating disorders are seen as dumb and stupid and only for teenage girls and it’s not that serious. 

I dropped a lot of weight over covid, down to my lowest I’ve ever been (110). Wanted to recover got up to 120, gained 5 pounds. I’m miserable at this weight. I feel fat and disgusting and a slob. I feel such embarrassment and shame everytime I eat. I’ve destroyed my digestive system. It’s completely ruined. 

People have commented on my weight since i was young. one of my friends that I thought i would trust with the information that I’ve struggled with my weight, since they struggle with theirs, will make off handed comments towards my eating. Or even me mentioning food. 

I’ve never been big big, maybe a little chubby but that’s it. I don’t judge others for the weight they gain, or how they eat, what they eat. I think having more meat on your bones is attractive, just not on me. I don’t like when others shame  people for their weight, I think it’s rude and disgusting and not for others t decide.

All I do is body check, all I do is think about my ed lately. I have a mix of other mental things wrong but this one’s been all I can think about .

I don’t have many people i ccan talk to. I just needed to rant. I can’t afford to gain weight for the sake of my mental state. I can’t afford to be weak and brail and barely stand for 10 minutes. 

I can’t feel pretty any other way. I’m not conveniently attractive, me having weight on makes me uglier. I hate the feeling of fat on my body. 

People like to romanticize this disorder a lot and I understand it’s a privilege to withhold food from yourself (1st world problems) but it’s awful. It’s one of the many hells I’ve created for myself. 

I get it eat well, work out you won’t have to worry about weight gain.

I went ""vegan"" plant based so I would have an excuse to not eat my parents cooking, etc. They try to cook vegan food for me now and I refuse to eat it. I hate myself because I know it makes them  sad but eating it gives me panic attacks. I used to weigh 20 pounds more. The other day me and my mom were looking at old pictures of me when I was only 14 pounds heavier (the picture was only of my face, not my body), and I went ""I can't believe you think I look pretty when I look like this"" and she said ""well you were fat there"" thinking I was much heavier then than I was. Weight loss in the face is barely visible after only 14 pounds. I don't care about my body I just wish i was prettier but I don't know what else to do. I can't accept that I have to look like this. My little sister and my mom are both extremely beautiful and get told it all the time. It feels awful knowing that both my siblings (brother and sister) have had relationships and had people crush on them when they're both younger than me and no one has ever found me attractive. Next week I turn 17 and I've had two breakdowns anticipating the food. My mom wants to get me a vegan cake but I told her not to because I don't know how many calories are in it. I've struggled with binging so I can't control myself around food if I'm not tracking it. and my grandma is coming so we all have to go to a restaurant and there's no restaurant that has vegan options and calories that my parents would agree to go to. Even if I didn't eat all day just for that meal, it would still be way over my limit and I wouldn't be able to stop myself. Either way my family always cuts cake and has treats in the morning so I don't know how to avoid it . I don't want to do anything for my birthday but they are making me.  I went to the doctor yesterday  and he told me that I shouldn't lose anymore weight (I'm not underweight, I'm in the 30th percentile for my height and age) but how can I not when I still look like this? I eat 1300 calories a day and am extremely sedentary, I had to eat that many because I don't want my hair to fall out and hate myself even more.

630,630,eating_disorders,"Some context, I’m a Bodybuilder that tracks calories and usually eats extremely clean while eating out but I don’t lack foods like ice cream, cake, etc, I actually have them a lot but homemade 99% of the time so I know what goes into it, and I can log my macros in accordance with my goals.

So here’s the weird thing I’ve been bulking for about three months now, to the extent food is pretty much sickening, I track calories, all that jazz and never give much thought to wanting a desert or anything; and if I do I just make it at home so I can track accurately. 

Two nights ago my friend psychoanalyzed me while I went out to eat with her and another buddy, we got American sushi and I actually had a large plate(6~ rolls) and hit my calories there for the day, and frankly anymore food sounded terrible. She insisted that we get ice cream shortly after, so we drive over to a shop but I didn’t want any, and she was not having it whatsoever. Insisting that I even get a kids size, I was full beyond imagination and didn’t want to turn my lean bulk too dirty, given I was just out of town for a few days prior and I had an early thanksgiving tomorrow(she was not aware of the early thanksgiving). 

Fast forward next day, I’m celebrating thanksgiving with my family early since most of us will be out of town, and I have never once over thought food so much in my life, the night before she was saying how much I miss out in life by not enjoying myself, despite me having all the foods anyone would typically crave like ice cream, cake, etc, already having macro friendly version(not volume just lower cal/no shitty ingredients and pro) and I had what I suppose is a binge, probably close to 10,000 calories with tons of pie, and the day after nearly the same. So I’ve probably put on 2lbs+ of fat as a result, and need to mini cut for 40~ days, and I’m hoping I can just do it for 20 with fasted cardio, but I just feel like this is the start to a terrible disorder. I don’t want to blame her but everything she said wouldn’t stop fucking echoing in my mind two days ago, I know she cares about me and is just looking out for me, but I just want to distance myself entirely, I just want to stick in line with my goals. Why can’t those around you sometimes understand that? Friends and family knows how much bodybuilding and everything it entails matters to me, but why did she(and I suppose others in the past) have to label what I do as such a bad practice I have no problem with?

Am I just hiding and coping an eating disorder yet I felt completely normal till two days ago with that barrage of conversation?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 months now (we know eachother for 1,5 year) and I am very happy with him. We both have meme accounts and that’s how we met lol.

He loves me a lot and he continues to show me that. However, I am a very insecure girl who’s had anorexia and a binge eating disorder. We had multiple fights about his instagram following cause he used to follow a lot of girls with insane bodies, a lot of celebirties that were either insanely skinny or had a BBL etc. It made me so so insecure, He ended up unfollowing them (he didn’t want to the first time cause he thought I was controlling) but I genuinely didn’t wanna eat for days if I just realised I didn’t look like any of those girls.

His ex is also very beautiful and very skinny, that also makes me super insecure, I compare myself to her all the time (thought this was worth mentioning) but I have to say it’s getting less and less by day.

Now we watched squid game together and he has been posting memes about the attractive actress in it which just gave me raging thoughts, how does he even know her name? It means he looked her up I suppose, now I’m just on the tip of about to cry in my room cause I just think i’ll never be good enough for him and that I also need to lose weight. Me and my eating disorder are so mad at him at the moment, it makes me wanna break up with him. Maybe I’m just not ready for a boyfriend

652,652,eating_disorders,"i posted this and then realized the title was absolutely Not Helpful to what the content contained at all, so i'm reposting it (even with the updated title i'm sure it's not helpful at all, sorry :( )

i'm not really sure how to start this off, so i'll just dump a few things. i'm 16f, 5'4 and a half, and recently weighed myself and saw i was 99 lbs. my mom said that i needed to eat more, and for awhile, made meals for me so i could try and regain the weight. i've always been a bit of a picky eater, but the meals she was cooking for me were ones i liked/was okay with. however, i was still unable to finish them. i do take vyvanse, which apparently lowers your appetite, so that probably has something to do with it. however, when my mom made fewer and fewer meals, i started to fail to see the reason as to why i should gain weight.

i began liking the numbers on the scale, and now i look forward to seeing if the numbers have dropped. i've never really had any hobbies or talents or anything to brag about, which has always made me feel bad, but now i feel like i finally have something to say about myself.

my friends tell me to tell my mom about how i may have an eating disorder (unsure as to whether or not this is true, i feel bad saying that i do even though all signs point to one because i'm aware self diagnosing is bad) and i know that this is a really bad situation and i should tell her so i can try and get help, but it's like i'm addicted to the feeling of knowing i finally have something to say about myself. every morning i'm almost *excited* to go weigh myself, anticipating whether the numbers have dropped even further. as of right now, my weight has stayed the same (\~99 lbs) which i'm not sure how is possible because i haven't eaten in 2 days, and as of tomorrow, it'll be 3 days. the hunger pangs are rare, but when they do come, they're intense. but, when i stand up to go drink water so i can trick myself into feeling full, the hunger disappears completely. this has been happening even before i realized i weighed 99 lbs, probably even for years.

it's confusing - sometimes when i look in the mirror i get scared. i don't look severely underweight at first glance, but my ribs stand out when i inhale and you can slightly see the ridges in my sternum on my chest. my back is a lot worse, though. my scapulas and ribs are a lot more prominent. my hipbones also jut out a lot, but then again they always have so i can't tell a difference in how they looked before and how they look now.

for some reason, while i know i should tell my mom, i just... can't. i do have diagnosed anxiety and adhd, but i'm not sure if that's what's holding me back, or if it's just shame or embarrassment. it's hard to describe this accurately, but it almost feels like i'm a drug addict confessing to my parents about how i think i need help.

the problem? my dad is *really* stingy with money. it's not as if we're poor, we could afford treatment if i needed it, but he's obsessed with saving money. he constantly keeps watch over our credit card payments and is always asking who bought what (i have two older brothers). he also always thinks i'm exaggerating. not sure how to word it, but an example would be how keys were falling off of my laptop. i asked if i could go to the apple store to get it fixed, and he refused, asking if my mom and i had ""even bothered to try to do it ourselves first."" we had, but he always assumes the worst of everyone. and he's constantly saying i don't need my glasses and that i was just making things up for attention. even then, he hasn't spoken a word to me since september 2nd, so there's that.

my mom is also influenced by him, whether she realizes it or not. she's definitely a lot more lenient, and i love her, but she's really controlling. you can tell she likes being a mother, that she likes having her children rely on her. and i get the brunt her care, now that both of my brothers are in college while i'm still in high school. she wants the best for me, but she's easily swayed by my dad's opinion. i feel like she's a shell of who she used to be, who she was before she got married to my dad.

i bring up the topic of my parents because i'm not sure they'll let me get treatment. as i said, my dad's obsessed with saving money and fixing things himself, so i'm sure that if i tell my mom, she'll tell him, he'll think i'm exaggerating, and if i keep up the ""act"" my mom will just make more meals for me which i can't even eat because i'm constantly nauseous.

i'm not really sure what i want this post to be. i guess it's more of a vent than anything, but advice would be appreciated considering i'm dying and there's literally no solution to this

660,660,eating_disorders,"I’ve [25F] struggled with eating disorders all my life. When I was a teen I didn’t eat until I was a certain weight. When I gained weight I would throw up. I was never “too thin” though always on the last number for a healthy weight for my height. Depression from breakups or the death of my grandfather who raised me and in my eyes was my father were the only two instances where I “naturally” became underweight. The depression was awful of course, and both circumstances I struggled with alcohol abuse and self-harm….but boy was I skinny. The doctors notes telling me I was underweight, the comments from people in my life, a mixture of I look great and I look too thin we’re almost orgasmic. The depression was crippling but the being so skinny was addicting? I’ve always managed to keep my life together due to childhood trauma and fear of not succeeding and being poor. I have a masters degree and make 114k a year at 25 years old because I never stopped working so hard, through the losses, the alcohol, the anorexia, and self-harm. I never stopped working. I’m a high functioning piece of shit. 

Fast forward and I live the “dream life” I’m engaged to be married in two weeks to the love of my life. He’s so wonderful. We bought a 5,100 square foot beautiful home in the suburbs and want to start a family. I am healthy 95% of the time besides constantly worrying and obsessing over my weight. 130 pounds 5’4. I’m so disgusted every single day. I don’t drink much anymore but when I do after a long day there is something so incredibly comforting about the MESS! I’ll sit in my car and drink tequila and convince myself to stop eating. Listen to my favorite sad music, sometimes even go to the bathroom, throw up and cut myself in discreet places my fiancé won’t notice. Fantasize about my bones sticking out again and being so thin I look sick. It’s so incredibly comforting and I feel like I’m home and this is right and where I belong. I l love myself and have hope.

Then it’s the next day. I know I have to work, not drink, eat, and be healthy and it sucks. I hate myself and I’m fat and ugly.

661,661,eating_disorders,"i’ve struggled with a concoction of eating disorders from age 12-present. i’ve been diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia and ednos because i literally take any and every route possible, depending on the day. 
i’ve always been a bit bigger because of my body shape and bone structure- i also have a hormonal condition that causes weight to stick pretty hard. unfortunately i’m one of those cases where unless you physically see my relationship with food you wouldn’t know i have an eating disorder. even my mom still doesn’t believe i do, even though i restrict heavily, starve myself, purge, abuse laxatives/hydroxycut, and over exercise. i’ve been to treatment, fainted in the gym more times than i can count. it’s had a hold on me since was so young. 
the thing is once i got to age 20 i was able to get a hold on my eating disorder because it was destroying my life, and through therapy and a nutritionist was able to start eating in a way that works for me. the thing is though, i gained about 30 pounds and now weigh 160… so last year my mom suggested i get a gastric bypass (she’s very fatphobic, and was 110 lbs most of her life and won’t accept that i’ve destroyed my body with eating disorders). my ED brain took it seriously so i made a consultation to get a gastric bypass where they laughed at me and immediately told me that I don’t qualify in the slightest and that if I want to lose weight I can exercise and eat right. it really broke my heart because my mom somehow had me totally convinced i actually needed the procedure. my body dysmorphia makes it to where i can’t gauge my appearance so i thought i may be valid. that was triggering- i relapsed, went back to therapy, back to square 1. was able to manage my weight for about a year, until recently when my sister told me my mother was constantly talking about how i’m going to die young because i’m morbidly obese, so i relapsed again 3 weeks ago. as of right now it’s only been purging and some restricting; but i just ordered a 6 month supply of hydroxycut as well as those garbage diet teas, and i plan on stocking back up on laxatives and over exercising again… i’d rather be seen as a valid human being even if it means i get really sick again…. i need help. i don’t know where to turn. i can’t turn to my parents because they never saw my eating disorder as valid because i never got lighter than 120 lbs. my mom supposedly tells my family i faked it all, despite having gone to treatment twice and having official diagnoses. 
i don’t know if i’m just ranting or what i think i’m going to gain. i think i just need to discuss this with people who understand. i just want to recover but i’m scared i never will

663,663,eating_disorders,"I suffer from quite a restrictive ed, and i was hungry so i thought baking would make me feel better &amp; i could be around food too- win win. 

I adore autumn &amp; cooking So part of me wanted to actually eat the autumn things i was baking- but ofc my head is screaming at me not too. 

My head was telling me i was strong enough to resist  the food, all what it usually would say; demonising the food. And i was ok with that- happy, because it means i was 'strong'.

Id offered one to everyone and then they were sat there for an hour.
 i had been debating wether i wanted to have one myself &amp; if it was worth all the pain i knew would follow, but in the moment it seemed manageable and alright and like i should just eat it and enjoy it like i would have years ago. 

So I had one. AND. made the dinner id planned for myself. I couldnt finish it but I kept myself distracted until i was completely done eating because i knew the thoughts would become loud enough soon and honestly just Could Not Be bothereeed!!! to deal w them. 

I ate that cupcake and a bit of a brownie id been thinking about all day and it wasnt even worth it. 
i could only enjoy it for about 10 seconds in the moment and what followed certainly was not worth it. 

I just proceeded to compulsivley excersize until 1am and sobbed about it until i got too tired to be awake. And did *everything* i could think of to counter act. 

The thoughts of worthlessness &amp; that id made my entire ed up, that i was a fake and this is why all my friends hated or would leave me. I felt like id binged and was disgraceful. (i know its not binging though)

That i didn't deserve to be alive or to waste anyones time because id lied to them and caused so much drama for no reason &amp; that i was a disgusting manipulative person and all these horrible things just would. not. stop. 

I feel like its not even worth maybe in the future trying to recover if i decide too. i feel like i'm stuck this way. 

Id been having a pretty tough week w my ed and MANY big life changes in general.
And in the past (pre ed), food would b a big comfort. - Not to the point where it was a problem, id always been lucky to be v skinny so it never felt an issue.
But yrs later its turned into the enemy completely. i feel like ill never enjoy food again. 

And even worse im still convinced i faked my ed and that someone who was really ill would never have ate what i did. 

But then part of me still rationalises it &amp; thinks that maybe im not lying because they wouldn't behave so strongly and have so much mental pain after eating it. it would be normal. 

Its such a trap. I dont even know what i think or feel anymore i just regret it enormously. 

Does anyone else ever feel like there faking or made it all up if they do something like that. 
Have I made my entire ed up??? or am i like just too deep in to even realise. i don't even know anymore. This is so so lonely.

I end up eating a lot of street food, there was a time when days used to pass by without me eating home-cooked healthy food.

Whenever I eat anything unhealthy or meat after I am done eating I am stuck by this huge wave of guilt, then I promise myself I won't do it again and I end up relapsing the next day. Gradually my health started taking toll .I developed h pylori bacteria and was diagnosed with dyspepsia as well as haemorrhoids. I have tried to improve my eating habits and have come to a point where I eat street food once every 2-3 days. I am on medical but still can't stop myself from eating shit. My health is degrading, I don't do any excercise and because of all this everything else in my life is getting affected . I have tried a lot to eat healthy whenever I try to put a vegetable or a fruit other than apple and watermelon I end up almost vomiting but I can drink fruit and vegetable smoothies but then they are not fulfilling and I get hungry after an hour or so.

i have a 30 yo uncle who has been through some rough time recently. he used to be very ""healthy"" and to ""look good"". he gained some weight and kind of stayed that way for a few months (i would say around 15/20 pounds)

he recently decided that he wanted to lose weight, which is ok.
but i started noticing he wasn’t eating that much and i asked him about his new diet.

turns out he eats 1100 kcal a day.
he is a 5’11 30yo man.

i tried talking to him so many times, explaining the medical reasons and why this is so unhealthy. he agrees with my statement but doesn’t want to change a thing.

i tried sending him some stuff from the internet explaining how this is wrong and what he should do if he wants to lose weight in a healthy way

nothing works. i’m a 16yo girl and i feel so sad watching this happening. i told the rest of the family about this, they don’t seem to be concerned. 

what should i do? i feel like i’m watching him dying in front of me?

The thing is, I’ve had food problems for 6 years now. The difference between now and then is that I was 120 pounds when I was really struggling. They thought I was just looking for attention, that I didn’t have a problem. That I wanted to go to therapy because it was what all my friends were doing. They thought that this was something I would just get over. I was not noticeably skinny so they thought I was fine.

I was also chewing and spitting at this time. I would lock myself in my room and chew and spit for hours. Spending $200 every few days on more food to spit. When I came home from college I weighed 115. I couldn’t believe I let myself get that high again. I tried exercise and reducing my calorie intake to lower my weight. I was still 116. I stopped weighing myself. I don’t weigh myself much anymore. In mid-June I was finally down to 112.

I’ve had dramatic weight gains and loss because of it and it’s effecting my life. I see other girls going about saying that they forget to eat all the time or they just go by their day eating a small snack and not caring about eating food as much. 
And then there’s me, I always think about what I’m going to eat or what food I want to eat everyday (part of the reason why I’m actually obsessed with cooking.)
I snack whenever I’m not hungry all the time and even when I’m full I always feel like I need to finish my meal.  
Food gives me satisfaction, it makes me feel a certain way of comfort emotionally. It gives me pleasure when I don’t get any from my daily life and it’s such a big part of my life that I feel like because it is, it’s a problem. 

I don’t want to think about food this much, I struggle with my weight for so long and been on multiple diets to control it. Currently I’m trying to fast which controls how much I eat and it helps a lot, but I’m not really loosing weight from it because I’m still eating high caloric foods.

700,700,eating_disorders,"I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not even sure If I’m posting this is the right place but ultimately I’m just looking for answers or ideas to why I barely eat. 

I feel like this all started about 4 years ago when I had gotten food poisoning. It left me sick and bedridden for about a month. That entire month I was eating nothing almost everyday. Maybe saltines here n there but I was mostly sleep for that entire month. I remember when I finally felt better and got to eat an actual meal it was hard. My teeth hadn’t been used or exercised in about a month so using them to chew things might’ve been the most painful feeling ever. I felt as though my teeth were getting ripped out of my gums, root and all. A very intense sore feeling. 

I found it hard to finish the plates my mom would make for me but my mom just told me that my stomach had probably shrunken and I just need to keep eating snd it’ll grow and I’ll be back to normal or whatever. 

I don’t know when it began after getting food poisoning but I kind of stopped eating all together, but not on purpose. I just won’t have an appetite for that day or I’ll literally be too lazy to make something or pick something up. Shit, I was too lazy to even order food on the phone I always had in my hand. It was just easier to not eat. Other days I would totally be hungry and hop in the kitchen and start to get down. But as soon as I sit down with that plate of food I just made, all my appetite would disappear and I would give it away or throw it away. Other days I’ll be in the middle of eating something and a wave of a feeling I can’t quite describe would stop me in my tracks and I’ll just be like “ehhh idk why but I don’t wanna eat anymore” it’s not like I’m disgusted by it or tired of what I’m eating I just don’t want to be eating anymore. 

For me this is really messing with my mental and my physical being. I hate knowing how hungry I am and wanting to eat but never eating, even when the food will be right in front of me. I just can’t ever hold an appetite for longer than 5 minutes. So if I don’t eat when I’m completely hungry and have the appetite for it, I won’t eat for a couple of days. 

I got a boyfriend 3 years ago (still dating) and I thought one of the perks of having a boyfriend was the healthy relationship weight you pack on (which was perfect bc I was trying to gain weight already) but if anything I’m losing weight. I avoid telling my boyfriend when I don’t eat, especially when it turns into days, bc he always just yells at me about how much I need to eat and how he doesn’t wanna have to worry about it bc he’s got a lot of other things to worry about. 

Again, I don’t even know if I’m in the right place for this but I’d love to know if what I’m dealing with is serious, or if I’m just being dramatic and reading too deep into it.",,Barely eating,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,p8jhmh,1,[deleted],,/r/eating_disorders/comments/p8jhmh/barely_eating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p8jhmh/barely_eating/,1629513847,571,0,0,0,-1,1,"Food poisoning and subsequent difficulty eating, lack of appetite, laziness, and physical discomfort while eating",harmful,"Experiences physical discomfort while eating due to past food poisoning, Lack of appetite and difficulty finishing meals, Avoidance of food and not eating for days at a time, Negative impact on mental and physical well-being, including weight loss",Food poisoning and lack of appetite,harmful,"Experiences physical pain and discomfort when eating due to prolonged lack of food intake, Lack of appetite and motivation to eat leads to not eating for days at a time, Negative response from boyfriend when expressing struggle with eating, Mental and physical health being affected",Experiencing loss of appetite and difficulty eating after a severe case of food poisoning,harmful,"Struggles with finishing meals or even starting them, Feelings of laziness and not wanting to eat, Difficulty holding an appetite for longer than 5 minutes, Avoiding telling loved ones about not eating due to negative reactions"
701,701,eating_disorders,"Hey. 

So I am 21/F, at age 13 I had bulimia and from there it went on for about a 1 and 1/2. At the time I was suffering with severe depression without knowing and I had never seeked any medical help up until I was 20. 

I thought in the past I was strong enough to overcome anything and back then people used to look at depression as something you could just get over and so I had the same mentality with my ED, I did well to stop myself from continuing to live that life but it caught up with me in ways I hadn't expected. 

Getting and drunk or being hungover and being sick, felt good but I knew it was bad to like it and it didn't kick in for a long while that I was enjoying it because it was the feeling of what it was like when I was bulimic. 

I decided 5 years ago that in diet change I wanted to go vegan, it was for the right reasons and I wasn't expecting it but I lost weight like it was nothing. I had bones showing out of skin and I hadn't ever seen them before and I was ecstatic about it. In 3 months I had lost 4 stone. Time went on however and now more and more vegan things are coming out which has meant more and more that things that where vegan have eventually become unhealthy again.

I went on birth control, I was eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and It caught up with me and I was piling on the pounds. Safe to say I am still in that rut where I am at a weight I no longer desire again. I'll be honest and say I am still binging. It gets worse and worse to the point Im not sure if I'm even vegan anymore. 

My mum makes all my meals and I'll sit there and wait till she goes on her late shift to then order myself some food, sometimes I get things with cheese on it. I cant tell you how many bags I have hiding in my room where it is all takeaways I'm trying to hide from my mum as I know she checks the bins to make sure I eat. 

My mum not that long ago found out that I had a past ED, she doesn't know I'm currently in a different one. I don't think she fully understands it and I don't think she understands the toll it has on someone especially with depression playing into it. My brain doesn't work in ways that she can understand.

Thats why the other day, to me it was a big deal but to her it was nothing. My mum put me on a diet. I was there on sunday laying in bed wondering why I was still so hungry, naturally I waited for her to go on shift and ordered myself so much food and binged. 

I then had a shift at work and my mum told me she had made my food for the day, ""this is your 500 day"" she said. We had previously discussed about doing the 5:2 diet which essentially is on 2 days of the week you eat only 500 calories in the day, the rest of the week you can eat whatever you want. However, even though I said I'd be down to try it again (failed in the past) I didn't know it was going to be right away. 

So when I was told that the day was my 500 day, i sarcastically (but also meant it) replied that it was nice of her to let me know I was starting my diet that day. Little did I know she then went on to tell me it wasn't my first day as she had put me on it on the sunday... hence why I was hungry and ordered food. 

It was weird because anyone else I've spoken to about think my mum was just trying to be kind. But i know in my head that they also just don't get it. My head was in loops when I found out. I already didn't like myself from binging on the sunday and then to find out that should have been my 500 day made me more disgusted with myself because although it shouldn't be what I think, the first thought that came to my head was that I should have been starving myself that day. 

Not sure this is the best diet for me to be going on right now. Don't know if anyone else has had something like this happened to them but let me know how everything got on. I'm not doing well in general and I really want to stop binging but the moment I do I feel like I'm starving myself and I get aggy.",,I've been put on a diet without knowing.,5,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,p726h0,1,KB_Levi,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/p726h0/ive_been_put_on_a_diet_without_knowing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p726h0/ive_been_put_on_a_diet_without_knowing/,1629326809,823,0,0,0,-1,1,Being put on a restrictive diet by mother,harmful,"Feeling triggered and disgusted with oneself after being put on the diet, Feeling like they should be starving themselves instead of eating, Struggling with binging despite wanting to stop",Being put on a diet by their mum without warning,harmful,"Feeling triggered and disgusted with themselves after finding out, Struggling with binging and feeling like they are either starving themselves or overeating",Being put on a diet by her mother,harmful,"Feeling disgusted with herself for not knowing that she was on a diet, Feeling like she should be starving herself when she finds out about the diet, Struggling with binging and feeling agitated when not binging"

710,710,eating_disorders,"in the beginning of my eating disorder she talked about how my aunt has anorexia and compared me to her saying “she looked sick. much sicker than you” and made these big eyes. i begged her and begged her to do research on eating disorders the 6 and a half months i was sick. later, when i started recovery i asked who looked sicker and she said my aunt. 

i couldn’t stop thinking about it. i’ve started my 5th month of recovery now and i’ve never missed my eating disorder more in my life. i literally cried into the warm flannel shirt i wore during my eating disorder. then came out and asked her who looked sicker she said my aunt as if it was the easiest thing she’s ever answered. i screamed in emotions pain. i asked again. she answered my aunt easily. i explained why it’s wrong and how people with eds want to feel sick before they recover. she said “you’re sick” then i asked again and she said “ur aunt what can i say everyone looks sick in their own way” idk what that means. i called a suicide hotline and when i told the girl she gasped. 

later, i explained how what she said hurt me. i also explained how the girl on the hotline gasped. all of the sudden she switched the story and said “you never asked who’s sicker you asked ‘when i asked you that night who looked sicker what did you answer” why would i even ask that. i feel like i’m going crazy. i screamed into my pillow for half an hour straight from emotional pain to the point my throat is sore. my jaw is hurting, my neck hurts and i have a pounding headache. i’ve never felt this much emotional pain in my life.

713,713,eating_disorders,"Hey guys... 

So I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, bulimia and ED my whole life. Some parts of me hate to be like this. Some parts of me kind of are too attached to it to let it go. Anyways. Recently I got helped with a holistic dietitian, we had a few appointments, she seemed extremely nice and good vibes, and I felt that she really got me. She told me that I could count on her and that she would be there with me on my weight loss journey. 

So after a few appointments there was one day I felt really sick and had a few episodes 🤢 on the day of our appointment. So I wrote her a message asking if instead of a regular face to face appointment, if she could use that booked time to read an email that I wrote opening up to her about my ED and telling my most deep secrets that not even my partner knows about, such as bulimia habits, how I hate myself, how depressed I am... 

I told her because I really needed help. I told her because I really did not wanted to give up on my self, I wrote to her that it was my last call for help. 

I felt comfortable (or naive) enough to after 4 appointments believe that we had a true connection. That she was kind to me because she really wanted to help me no matter what. 

Two days after this email she replied that she received my email and she was going to reply it soon. 

This was two weeks ago and Friday I decided to give another try, so I sent her a voice message asking her if she saw my email, that I understand that it was quite important to me, and if she do not would like to continue as my dietitian to let me know. I sent this last one crying. Apologising for being too much but thing were really hard for me. Still no reply. 

Even though I told her how bad I was, I desperate for help I was. 
I was calling for help. 
I thought I could ask for help. But no. 

The worst part is that I can’t stop to overthink it, check my phone to see if she replied, check my email, check her social media, I’m becoming a stalker or something, the fact that she rejected help really messed with my mind, I think I’m getting crazy sometimes.

So I simply stopped eating diner throughout it the day and I would wait until I would get home (at 5:30) to eat anything. 

Do I have a fear of food? Or am I just mixing not eating with anxiety? 

Today, I didn’t eat anything because I knew I would go to a party and I didn’t want anxiety. Now, when I got home I’m drunk and I don’t have the energy to even eat. 

I think my brain gives my stomach signals to feel sick when I eat anything out of my home since as soon as I take a bite of food I instantly feel sick and need to go to the washroom. I’m tired of fearing my own stomach and I envy my friends who can literally eat whenever and whatever they want.

Those are the two main areas I fixate on and shame myself for.

They’ve told me in panicky voices that they should’ve “saw the signs earlier” and that I look like a Holocaust survivor but I think they’re over exaggerating.
Anyway, I eat small portions and exercise as much as possible. And I’ll continue to do so until I achieve a body I’m happy with. Even if I don’t want to...
I’ve come so accustomed to this ‘striving for unreachable perfection’ lifestyle that I won’t be able to get out of it any time soon. And it doesn’t help that my mom said I just naturally have a “big face on a skinny body”.

I was around 120 pounds at this time and gradually gained weight again until i was overweight. my highest weight was 200 pounds.

so anyway, fast forward to now i’m 23 and haven’t starved myself for years. i smoked weed regularly and loves cooking and baking sooo much. also alcohol lol. but now i am dealing w health issues (GERD and LPR) that feel like they r reverting me back to my eating disorder days. i cry whenever i cook partially bc everything makes me feel like shit and also i don’t feel like i deserve to eat bc eating is kind of what put me in this situation in the first place? and ik logic to fight that idea but i just don’t believe it.

i’ve been starving myself the past week in the name of “health” bc some of my issues may be solved if i’m thinner. i’m lying to my loved ones about eating but even they aren’t worried bc i’m still technically overweight. sometimes it’s like they r proud of me and my discipline and it makes me so fucking sad. i hate food now and i hate eating and i am going down the same road i did before. i’m happy bc i’m losing weight but sad bc i can’t even fight the negativity since i’m in physical pain. idk, i just needed somewhere to talk about it :/ idk what to do",,idk how to get myself out of this AGAIN,3,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,oxrza2,1,kandall44,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/oxrza2/idk_how_to_get_myself_out_of_this_again/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oxrza2/idk_how_to_get_myself_out_of_this_again/,1628081361,290,0,0,1,-1,1,Health issues (GERD and LPR) and the idea that being thinner will solve them,harmful,"Feeling like they don't deserve to eat and crying when cooking, Lying to loved ones about eating and feeling sad when they are proud of them for losing weight, Hating food and going down the same road as before",Health issues (GERD and LPR),harmful,"Experiencing negative emotions surrounding food and eating due to health issues, Feeling like they don't deserve to eat because of their past eating disorder, Lying to loved ones about eating and feeling sad when they are proud of their discipline, Starving themselves in the name of ""health"" and losing weight","Health issues (GERD and LPR), lying to loved ones about eating, and being praised for losing weight",harmful,"Health issues are triggering the writer to revert back to their eating disorder, Lying to loved ones about eating, Feeling like they don't deserve to eat and hating food, Going down the same road as before"

I started to have an ED when I started my master degree after gaining weight from going out and eating a lot. I am now a bit overweight and really not happy with how I look like. 

To lose weight I tried everything, OMAD, water fasting, keto and it only makes it worse!

I feel now a bit depressed and want to recover. I am trying to eat normally (no more restrictive eating for my metabolism to get normal again) but I am bloating so much and my stomach hurts. With my stomach bloating, I feel even worse. I don’t want to go out or to meet friends again because I don’t feel confident. I have a hard time to concentrate at work as well. Now I cry so easily as well. I decided to take a personal trainer twice per week to lose weight in a healthy way and help with my stress.

I'm trying to incorporate more into my diet (old safe foods) and, above all else, believe that I am not some hideous waste of space. Yet I'm constantly anxious and have no appetite at all, and seem to feel guilty eating anything half the time. 

I was under CAHMS for EDNOS (kind of orthorexia?) about two years ago... unfortunately they didn't really help and I'd heard worse of adult services so decided to swerve them, giving my therapist the impression I'd carry on 'doing well'. This wasn't the case. Other factors: Covid, university, etc. have made maintaining a reasonable virtually impossible and from early 2021 I entered into a downward spiral of weight loss and misery. It's a bit grotty.

I feel stupid - I have enough wrong with me without an ED - and unable to move. I just don't know what to do with myself. I have a psychotherapist... but he doesn't really seem to understand how bad this all is and I just can't tell him because he seems to be the only friend I've got. My Mum, my biggest support, is trying to help me too... though I can't overrely on her. She was my biggest support and biggest help last time but everything just feels so impossible now. I look hideous, need to gain weight - yet feel disgusting and need some form of motivation to do so because I lack it in every capacity. I used to love cooking, baking and feeling well on a semi-vegan (occasional egg) diet - but now I find that I'm not all in it at all. I'm seemingly just getting worse: my face has swollen (no idea why) - eyes and relatively evenly below the corners of my mouth; I'm constantly needing to pee; mottled legs and always cold (rollnecks in summer, you name it). It's very bad and I hate to worry everyone so much - as much as I try to hide all this.

this whole thing started about 2-3 years ago when i became very self concious about my body. i started skipping meals, avoiding food and i even purged a few times. my self harm struggle was at a peak at the time so i went to a councilor and i told them about it which lead to me talking about the way i felt about food and my body. counseling didn't really help they barely even talked to me or acknowledge my relationship with food. when my counselling sessions finished i slowly started going back to self harming and also skipping meals. as of right now, im counting calories every day, weighing myself a lot more, avoiding food and skipping meals (i usually eat 800 cals to 1200 cals per day). i havent lost any significant weight and i dont think i look much thinner than i did before but this whole thing still affects my daily life so so much and im not even sure what to think about it. i cant currently visit a professional. however, acknowledging that this could potentially be a problem is so scary and i just dont wanna believe it overall but it's also hard for me to not know what to think of it. i also know that asking people on the internet and self diagnosing (which im not trying to do) is just not the way to go but its my only option as of right now",,is this an ed??,3,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,opyyyg,1,angeline_23,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/opyyyg/is_this_an_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/opyyyg/is_this_an_ed/,1627033081,252,0,0,1,-1,1,"Self-consciousness about body, skipping meals, purging, self-harm, counseling",harmful,"Counseling did not address the writer’s relationship with food and their eating disorder worsened after the sessions, Currently counting calories, weighing themselves, avoiding food, and skipping meals, Eating 800-1200 calories per day","Struggling with self-harm and body image issues, skipping meals, avoiding food, purging, counseling that did not address the relationship with food",harmful,"Continuing to struggle with counting calories, weighing oneself frequently, avoiding food, and skipping meals, Feeling scared and unsure about acknowledging this as a problem, Unable to visit a professional for help","Self-consciousness about body, skipping meals, purging, counseling",harmful,"Counseling did not help with relationship with food, Continued self-harm and disordered eating behaviors, including counting calories, weighing oneself frequently, avoiding food, and skipping meals"

748,748,eating_disorders,"Brain dump (so apologies if there is a lack of continuity): I am thin but normal. I used to be 8kg lighter. I recovered physically but the hilarious part is that I  barely changed my diet and exercise routine. I've always eaten a wholesome pescatrian diet that consist of breakfast, lunch and dinner with a small 'desert' after lunch and dinner. My portions are generous for every meal. I love sports, I'm athletic and exercise 4 times/week. From the outside, I look like someone who's got their life together; my own company, a stable relationship, a loving family and a good group of friends. However, I miss my old body so much that it makes me severely depressed and nothing in life makes me happy. I used to be the thinnest out of everyone I knew. Now, I have friends who lost weight and are thinner than me. I constantly look at my old pictures, compare myself to every single person around me and on Instagram. I don't understand how people can skip meals, fast, eat small portions, serve themselves only once, forget to eat, exercise every day etc. If I did that, the empty pit in my stomach would distract me and all I would do is think about my next meal. I would suffer. I can lose 2-3 hours a day taking pictures and videos and analysing every square inch of my body. My mind is poisoned. However, with an eating disorder plaguing my every thought, I still perform really well. But imagine my mind free of it. My potential is huge. But in all honesty, my body makes me so angry and depressed that nothing matters and all I want is to lose a bit of weight. Never go down to the level I was because I would destroy my company, my relationship and everything around me, but maybe 3-4kg. However, no matter how much I try, I cannot seem to change the way I eat or exercise. I can't stop eating that small desert after lunch or my 5 squares of dark choc after dinner. I can't just cut a little bit out of my meal, just a little. I can't do any of that. I can't up my exercise to 5 times instead of 4. For some reason, it feels like I'm on autopilot and can't change my lifestyle to lose that extra bit of weight. And that makes me even more obsessed and more depressed and ANGRY. That is my struggle.

757,757,eating_disorders,"so i’ve been putting a lot of thought into this and i think the main reason i have an eating disorder is my mother.

for one, i’ve always been a picky eater and the entire time i was growing up she hated that. she would force me to eat foods i hated and i have vivid memories of her forcing me to eat mashed potatoes even tho the consistency and texture made me gag every time and she knew that. i would be sitting at the table crying about to throw up just so that she could make sure i ate my vegetables instead of her giving me literally anything else that wasn’t torture for me to eat. 

she would always say that it was my fault there wasn’t any food i liked around the house and that if i asked for stuff she would get it but whenever i asked for anything i was ignored. one time i asked for sliced apples and my father said it wasn’t a valid request so i didn’t get any. i have braces and can’t bite into apples but i don’t always have it in me to cut an apple up so i literally just wanted apple slices but i didn’t get those.

eventually my mom got tired of forcing me to eat food that i didn’t like so she just stopped giving me food at all. she continued making food for my brothers and just told me i was old enough to handle it myself. so then i was left having a horrible relationship with food because of my mother, and no one to make sure i was eating. 

eventually i found foods i liked and it turned into even more of a problem because then instead of just not eating much it turned into a cycle of me eating way too much that i felt sick and then me starving myself because of how terrible i felt. and throughout all of this my mother would make comments about my body.

i felt so insecure because of her that i would wear clothes that covered literally everything. when i finally got my eating under control and was comfortable with my body, i started dressing like normal teenagers do and that was clearly unacceptable because according to my mom wearing a tank top in 90 degree weather isn’t allowed.

i had also gone to my doctor at one point and she was concerned that i was underweight and told me to go see her again after three months so of course after we left the appointment my mom got mad at me for not eating. when we went back three months later the doctor was happy that i hadn’t lost anymore weight (because i put in the effort to try and get better) and my mom told her that i don’t actually have a problem i’m just a picky eater and find it fun to be difficult about meals.

so anyway i refuse to reread that so hopefully it makes sense but yeah i’m fairly certain if it weren’t for my mom i would be able to actually eat normally and typing all that made me feel a lot better. i always feel bad talking to my friends about this stuff because the people that don’t get it just make me feel so much worse but i don’t want to hurt the people that do get it by reminding them of how hard it can be.",,i blame my mother for most of my problems,15,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,offlme,1,arson-is-hot,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/offlme/i_blame_my_mother_for_most_of_my_problems/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/offlme/i_blame_my_mother_for_most_of_my_problems/,1625650736,583,0,0,0,-1,1,"Forced to eat foods she hated, ignored when requesting foods she liked, mother made negative comments about her body",harmful,"Developed a difficult relationship with food, leading to cycles of overeating and starving, Feeling insecure about her body and covering up with clothing, Mother denied the existence of her eating disorder and claimed she was just a picky eater","Negative comments and forceful feeding from mother, lack of support and attention from family",harmful,"Developed a picky eating habit and a negative relationship with food, Cycle of binge eating and starving, Insecurity and negative body image, Feeling unsupported and invalidated by family, Mother dismissed and denied daughter’s eating disorder","Negative and abusive behavior from the mother, including forcing the writer to eat foods they hated, withholding food, making comments about their body, and dismissing their eating disorder as being a picky eater",harmful,"Developed an unhealthy relationship with food, including bingeing and restriction, Feeling insecure and covering up their body due to comments from their mother, Feeling unsupported by friends who don't understand their struggles"

So I searched on internet and found that it might be an eating disorder seeing the symptoms and my situation.

761,761,eating_disorders,"I’ll start with some context. I joined Color Guard my sophomore year (I will be a senior this fall) of high school and had a full, regular season until the end of Winter Guard when the pandemic began. We had a “season” in the fall of 2020 with no competitions and an exhibition performance, however I was diagnosed with Anorexia near the end of the season and had to quit as it was no longer safe for me to continue. After quitting and not having to do a season of Winter Guard, I felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. For one I was too weak to do very well at all, which made me embarrassed and quite stressed. I also realized how big of a commitment Color Guard was, not only time wise but emotionally, mentally and physically it consumed me. However, I also felt a sense of guilt not having finished out the season and returning for Winter Guard. I missed the activities my guard traditionally does together, the performing, competition days, and just the activity in general. So when this year rolled around and my recovery only got better and better, I told myself that this season would be my opportunity to push myself and have the best season yet with my newfound confidence and awareness of my health. I have improved a lot and am not as worried about performing poorly like I was my sophomore year. However, my school is a big school with a band that consistently competes at the state and national level. Because of this, we are highly competitive, and have intense and lengthy rehearsals. Lately I have felt myself slipping and I have restricted more than I thought I was. I exercise on a regular basis and I can feel myself losing my stamina, and I did weigh myself this morning and I have lost a substantial amount of weight in a short time. I know this isn’t sustainable for Color Guard, and if I continue down this road it will end my season like last year.

He has a very large underweight, he is constantly feeling bad because of it, sometimes he can't get out of bed, freezes, feels himself very weak

He is very worried about his appearance, considers himself ugly, doesn’t wear anything but baggy  sportswear, can’t go out in a t-shirt, only in a hoodie. Can't go to the pool/beach/gym. He hates eating in front of someone else, also he is afraid to weigh himself

He considers himself too thin, tries to gain weight, work out (if girls usually lose weight, guys most likely try to gain weight and work out, I think?), but he says that he simply can't eat, even when he is hungry, and that every bite is accompanied by pain. He eats only a limited set of foods that don’t make him disgusted and that he can always eat

He has a constant stomach ache from hunger, and he says that he likes this feeling, and he intentionally doesn’t eat to feel the pain. He also sometimes says that he wants to lose even more weight, because then he  will hate himself even more and this is something like a punishment.

780,780,eating_disorders,"To start off, I don't really know if I even have an ED, even though my behaviors are similar. It started when I was around 11, more of an social anxiety thing at the time. I would avoid ordering food at restaurants because the words would feel like they get stuck in my throat and I couldn't order, so I would just not eat anything, or at the very least order a salad. 

It was like that for a few years, until I was 13, I had a few friends who were obsessed with skincare, and would get angry If I accidentally touched their face because they didn't want to get acne because of me. They would frequently talk during lunch about how they weren't going to eat certain things to avoid getting bad skin. My skin was not terrible, but being a young and impressionable teenager, I naturally became extremely self conscious. This is where it really got bad. I would spend time reading and analyzing every ingredient to make sure it wouldn't make my skin bad. I would spend hours online researching diets to make me healthier for better skin. This just spiraled into diets for weight and longevity, which no 13 year old should have to worry about. 

I wouldn't eat sugar, of almost any kind, no dairy, no processed foods, no foods that seemed overly fried or oily. And if no food in my specific ""diet"" were available, then I just wouldn't eat anything.  My school lunches became dreadful, and my biggest ""enemy"" was sugar. At the time I was also fucking up my skin with my mass amounts of products I was using, but that's not really relevant.  I also started to develop a paranoid idea that any food that I didn't make was poisoned. I remember at my sister's 21st birthday vacation, I wanted to seem grateful and eat the cake there, but I never really got to enjoy that day, because I was in the bathroom emptying my stomach to get rid of the cake. 

When I went to highschool, if my family hadn't gone to the store in a while and none of my ""safe"" lunch foods were not at home, I just wouldn't eat lunch. My friends knew I wouldn't eat at times but they just thought I was picky, but I wanted to eat what they ate, I just never allowed myself to. I was so unhappy at the time. 

It wasn't until the past couple of years that things got a little better. A little. I started online school (not bc of the virus, I started online on my own choice in 2019) and was able to eat at my own times, and became a little less paranoid, maybe because I stopped hanging out with friends that made me feel bad, maybe because certain ""healthy"" foods are typically more expensive, or maybe because of a less anxiety inducing environment. 

But its still very difficult. I still have things I won't eat, but its more of preferences rather than feeling like the foods are unsafe. No one around me seems to understand though. My brother mocks me when he sees me eat something I typically wouldn't, but I'm used to his comments and usually brush it off. It is mainly my sister or mother, when I eat a burger or something, they loudly exclaim and question me or raise an eyebrow. I don't know why but it makes me extremely paranoid and awful, I feel like I am 13 again, crying at night because I was too hungry to fall asleep. When they say these things I usually but the food back when their backs are turned or just decide not to eat. 

Now I WANT to eat, but I just can't bring myself to do it properly. I get very hungry, but the act of actually eating something just seems tiring so I skip out. I just want to be able to eat normally again.",,I hate when anyone mentions my past eating habits (sometimes current) and I just feel like shit.,21,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,o7vcuo,1,0905Tomato,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/o7vcuo/i_hate_when_anyone_mentions_my_past_eating_habits/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/o7vcuo/i_hate_when_anyone_mentions_my_past_eating_habits/,1624651406,666,0,0,0,-1,1,"Social anxiety, negative influence from friends, paranoia, family members mocking or questioning food choices",harmful,"Developed restrictive eating habits and avoidance of certain foods due to anxiety and fear of negative consequences on skin, Paranoia led to belief that any food not made by the writer was poisoned, Difficulty eating in social situations and family gatherings, Still struggling to eat properly despite wanting to","Social anxiety, friends obsessed with skincare, fear of certain foods, paranoia about food being poisoned, family members mocking/questioning food choices",harmful,"Avoiding ordering food at restaurants and not eating if unable to order ""safe"" foods, Developing a restrictive diet based on fear of certain foods and for better skin, Skipping meals if ""safe"" foods are not available, Feeling extremely paranoid about food and avoiding eating in front of family members, Difficulty eating normally and feeling tired when trying to eat","Social anxiety, friends obsessed with skincare, paranoia about food being poisoned, family members commenting on food choices",harmful,"Developed restrictive eating habits and avoidance of certain foods, Paranoia about food safety and quality, Emotional distress and anxiety related to food and eating, Difficulty eating properly due to exhaustion and lack of motivation"

783,783,eating_disorders," I feel so stupid posting this long pointless story, but I feel like I can't tell anyone else. I haven't even approached it with my husband yet, but I know that's coming. I just need to share my thoughts and see if anyone can relate to my particular situation.

I've been pretty privately struggling with disordered eating habits for a while. In the past few years, I lost a lot of weight through healthy means. I still felt I wasn't thin enough, and I restricted probably a bit too much on most days, but I was more or less in maintenance mode with some weeks that would include more weight loss. But generally, I stopped checking the scale and was mostly focused on healthy living. For a good, long time. 

Then, a few months ago, I was prescribed medication that impacted my appetite. I would have to set reminders to eat because I don't get hungry as often as I used to. This was fine for a while. Then, as an additional factor, my schedule at work picked up to the point where I have barely any breaks in my day. I work 6 days a week at crazy hours, and unfortunately my job isn't a job that I am able to eat during, unless I am in between clients. 

So, I started reminding myself to eat between clients, and this was...okay-ish. The problem is I got into the habit of saying, ""You're not that hungry right now. Why don't you hold off until the next break?"" Then, I would get busy, and I would be distracted when I DID start to feel hunger, and I would push through that feeling because I figured...eating less is better.

I honestly don't know why this happened--where ""less"" became ""right.”  But I gradually slipped into these patterns of behavior that reflect the idea that the less I'm eating, the better. The confusing part of this is: I DO NOT THINK I'M FAT. I LIKE THE WAY I LOOK. I DO NOT FEEL I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT. And I want to make that clear. Everyone is constantly telling me I've lost weight. Sometimes they say it as a compliment and ask how I'm doing it. Sometimes they express concern about whether I'm eating enough.

At this point, I think I've basically become addicted to the number dropping. When I eat fewer calories, I feel powerful. When I lose more pounds, I feel a sick sense of satisfaction. And I literally do not understand why because I like the way I look. So, now I'm in the underweight category, (if you believe in the BMI) which has literally never happened before to my knowledge, and I am \*still\* continuing in restriction mode. I know this can't be going anywhere good, and yet I'm not stopping it. I feel like such a gross person admitting this. I know my husband would be heartbroken if he heard these words.

Ok, so I am very skinny &amp; very tall....I've done modeling in the past. I've never starved myself in my life, but I do in fact have a small appetite. I've had a friend for the past 4 years who always talks about how she has bullimia. She never seems to get any help though. She in turn takes it out on me &amp; nobody else. She tells me I look anorexic in public &amp; says it's a compliment, asks how much I starve myself between meals, and gets mad at me if I don't finish my meals. Like really mad, and tries to convince me that I'm the one with the ED. If I say anything she blames her ED.

As an example:
I was joking with another friend about how ""I wish I was pregnant, so I could eat more"" because we were having like a friendsgiving. And then the friend I'm talking about turns out to be right behind me and says ""Oh my god, you're trying to make fun of me...you're shaming my body!"" And I was like ""no, I didn't even know you were behind me"" which I didn't. And in the end everyone blames me because she's the one with the ED.

2nd Example:
We're eating korean food, and it's really spicy. She gets mad at me and says I'm starving myself because I couldn't swallow all the soup fast enough. I was so infuriated that I took the whole bowl and chugged it and felt sick the whole night.

I purposefully hide in the bathrooms at lunch so I don't have to sit there while she tries to feed me &amp; tell me off about how I don't eat anything. I always feel insecure eating in front of people now and I feel as though I have to explain myself when I don't finish my food. Like I have nearly cried before because I was with a group of people who didn't even comment about my eating. Like I could actually sit there and not think about enjoying my meal.

802,802,eating_disorders,"I have had at least one ED since 2018, and while I was doing really good for a while, lately I can feel myself slipping back into those habits. 

Last month, my family moved across the US, and I had to go with(unwillingly). I had to leave all of my friends, not that I had many to start with. I also had to leave the one thing that was helping me eat regularly, weed. I moved from a state where I had my medical marijuana card to a state where it was completely illegal. But that’s not the point. 

I was fortunate enough to have been able to start three relationships with people I care deeply for, but two of them are back home.

The stress from this move and not having a house yet(even though we’ve been here for a month already) have been making whatever fucking disorders I have act up. Like, EVERYTHING. I’ve been more depressed, anxious, suicidal, I’ve self-harmed more often, and my relationship with food has gone down the drain. I’m trying to stay strong for my partners, but it’s getting hard to do that. 

When I have thought about food, it makes me sick to my stomach. I’ll binge eat, and then feel guilty and purge, but then I’ll feel guilty about wasting all that food so I’ll self harm and start a timer to track how long I go without food.

804,804,eating_disorders,"Hi, I’ve never posted here but I feel like I need to talk about this and I’m gonna rant. 
I used to struggle with hardcore anorexia and later binge/ starve habits. I recovered pretty well when I was 16, but I also stopped taking anti depressants around that time and my body has continuously changed over the last two and a half years. I was doing so well, I was comfortable with myself and wore whatever I wanted and ate and found a passion for cooking. 
Recently I put a lot of weight on though, and I can’t look at myself in the mirror without wanting to cry. Some days I wake up and I think I look fine, but as soon as I eat just a bite of something or even take a sip of water I feel like the shape of my body has changed entirely. I feel like I’m pouring out of my clothing and like I’m taking up so much space. I’ve gotten into a habit of not eating breakfast or lunch, so that by the time I go to work or go out with friends or anything I still look good in my clothes, but usually I’ll still eat dinner. I’ve started a habit of dinner out of a specific small bowl to limit my portion, and thinking about eating out of any other bowl makes me incredibly nervous. 
6 days a week I work from around 3-9, and I’ve started a habit of not making dinner and using the time I get out as my reason. 
After a few days of this habit, which gets worse on the weekends when I know I’m gonna go out, I start to think I look good and will eat a normal portion or eat lunch before work and then it starts over again. 
It’s also a struggle because my boyfriend and I love in the same house, and spend every day together. He’s very skinny naturally and fit, and eats a lot of junk food. He likes to bring home snacks and go out for ice cream and things like that and he gets sad and worried when I don’t want to have any and it makes me steel bad about myself. And I have intimate moments with my partner that I ruin because I start feeling like I look gigantic and saggy and repulsive and I need to hide myself right away and he gets confused by my sudden mood changes. 
I also struggle with substance problems, and this is not helpful with everything. When I’m going out, I’m usually drinking a LOT and doing a lot of drugs. But I avoid eating for a day or two before I go out to look okay, and it has resulted in shit lately. An overdose, embarrassment, blacking out. I’m just sad because I want to look good, but I feel like even though I hardly eat even everyday recently I look larger every day. AND I have a limited diet! Im vegan and am a very poor independent 19 y/o and hardly afford groceries lol. 
I don’t think my ED is really back cause some nights I eat a good dinner and some days I eat chips or gross snacks like that but these feelings have been controlling my life.

807,807,eating_disorders,"So I’m a 17-year-old male, 5’6, 105lbs(usually) heading into my senior year of high school. I just got out of my first relationship ever and it’s kind of left me heartbroken. The issue is with the heartbreak my body’s number one response is to either cry and have anxiety attacks or what happens most of the time is I have this feeling that makes me sick to my stomach. I get this anxious feeling and my stomach is just doing flips. I’ll maybe eat one meal a day and even then I don’t really finish it. This is really upsetting to me because before the relationship and when I was in the relationship I was finally getting myself to eat a whole three meals a day while also snaking at night too. I was also actually intaking enough calories that my weight was kind of going up by like a pound or two, which I haven’t ever really been able to do in my life when I was trying to. 
I don’t know if this is an ED or if it’s more of just anxiety causing it. It could also just be all in my head and I’m just over exaggerating. But I’ve been underweight my entire life and me losing weight while I’m in the least amount of weight of my age group isn’t something I can afford to do. Especially since I’m running my first cross country season this year. So the combination of never wanting to eat and burning 500 calories or more a day isn’t good for me.

808,808,eating_disorders,"How do I know whether or not I have an eating disorder or need to recover? My weird eating habits started in, 2016 when I was 16. I remember coming across a video about the vegan diet and all of it's health benefits. Because of this I became motivated to try it.

I went into the diet blindly and didn't know anything about protein, carbs, fat, or even calories. I remember eating scraps...junk food. Cakes, chips, and candy...never ate anything nutritious. As long as I didn't consume meat, I thought I was practicing healthy eating.

I ate like this for 2 years...probably eating no more than 1200-1500 calories per day. Was definitely very famished and starved. And some times even fasted for multiple days. I was 6'0 160 pounds...I never lost a significant amount of weight. Only like 5-10 pounds, but I was also smaller and way weaker than my peers. I looked extremely ill. 

From 2016-2018, I had a ton of weird health issues come up. Lack of concentration, apathy, eye floaters, insomnia, hypothyroidism, and I can go on and on. I added meat back into my diet thinking that would improve my health. As if not eating meat was the cause of all my health issues. I didn't get any better. In fact, as time went on, I kept getting worse. I started losing hair, tinnitus out of no where, skin became gray, dry and dull. And more...

Things just kept getting worse. Fast forward 2020, I decided to eat 4000 calories/day. I had come across the Minnesota Starvation Experiment in December of 2019 and I remember starting a day after, Kobe passed on January 27th. My first go at it only lasted 3 days. I wouldn't try again until late april. Were pretty heavy in the pandemic during this time and my brother and sisters school would come by in a bus to our apartment complex and drop off cafeteria food. I would eat that and whatever we had at the house as long as it equated to 4000 calories at the end of the day.

This round of recovery lasted from late April to the end of May....and when I tell you I was extremely exhausted every day, I mean it...I also gained a bunch of weight. I went from like 165 to 190lbs. From May to sometime in 2021, I would eat 3000-4000 calories on and off...never consistently. Like I would eat 3500 calories on day and then for 2 weeks eat 1500. From January 2020 to sometime in 2021, I know it may sound crazy, but I went from 160 to 290 pounds.

This is very confusing to me, because even after gaining all this weight, all the health issues I had when I started restricting in 2016 to 2018 are still present...I literally only gained weight. My hair still falls out, my skin still looks 30 years aged...now I'm just overweight and and still very ill and dead inside

811,811,eating_disorders,"I'm not sure if this is an eating disorder or not, it's just me

I think it started early spring 2019. End of 7th grade. Throughout 5-6 grade I was kinda chubby. Overall not bad. 7th grade was no exception. For some reason when I grew past Mom it really hit and stung. I grew out of all my pants and was complaining about not having pants to wear so mom took me to the store. I had to get 8s. Standing in the dressing room I grabbed my belly and showed mom my muffin top. She said ""man we really need to get you exercising."" That's when it hit me, This is the solution to my problem! I didn't say anything for a few days though. When I finally did, it was in several tearful confessions, in the car where she couldn't escape. Eventually we got me started exercising in the morning and tracking calories. I might be remembering wrong though because I have clear memories of morning exercising in 6th grade. Anyways, I weighed in the realm of 145 pounds. I was too ashamed and told mom 140. That's what we put in MyFitnessPal, after confirming I was over 18. That should have been the first red flag. I started to restrict calories and when I saw results, I starting restricting even more. By July or August of 2019, I was 135 pounds. I was pretty proud but at this point the loss plateaued. Putting me less than halfway towards my goal of 120 (red flag number two). It's also important to note that I was consistently eating only 800 calories per day (red flag 3). One can imagine why I was frustrated. Even if you didn't notice the first red flag, certainly you'd see this one. 800 calories per day isn't enough for a growing 13 year old. I also did a couple hardcore juice cleanses. My sister was recommended a liquid diet until her poop was clear (for medical reasons). I decided to do that too because why not. I got to the point where my poop was 100% liquid. My stomach hurt so bad and even just looking at gatorade made me sick. Body checking became a regular habit. I knew my BMI as well as what it would be if I was an inch shorter/taller or a pound less/more. Mom was fully aware of all this stuff and even still I was routinely congratulated on my ""self discipline"" by both her and dad. In August? was when dad and I went on a cruise. I went from 135 to 138 during that week. On the cruise I met a girl who was certainly shorter than me but she only weighed 116. I remember because we had to get weighed to go on the two person water slides. She also couldn't go on the tall water slide or else she'd get stuck, she was so small. A couple different times she complained that ""every time she looks she weighs less!"" I was kind of annoyed and more than a little jealous. After getting home my weight stayed at 134-140. I was fully on a new at this point and even just eating a tortilla made me sick. I maintained a steady 140ish until January 2020 when we went to Disneyland. I decided to go off the diet for the trip but then go back on once it was over. It'd be hard to do that in California anyways. So I go and eat whatever I want. After getting home, I couldn't go back on the diet - my food cravings were too intense. So I didn't. And so my weight suddenly jumped to 150 where it chilled awhile. Flash to quarantine (Marchish 2020). I have nothing to do all day except eat, so my weight climbed to 161. That was the stopping point for me. I looked in the mirror and hated what I saw. I looked up all sorts of crap online during this depressive state - how to lose weight quick, keto, juice cleanses, etc. I knew everything. I wanted to slim down again and I knew what helped last time. I figured I might as well bring that back. So I did. I managed to get to 150. I wasn't as religious with it however and soon totally abandoned it. That was fall 2020. It's always difficult to do this kind of thing during school. The social pressures and not to mention laziness make it almost not worth it. Somehow surprisingly, I maintained 150. It's now March and I'm tired of this. I hate riding on the border between regular and overweight. Lately I've been really bad at impulse control. I eat enough for a small kingdom. And I think if I continue this way I will start uncontrollably gaining weight again. I used to tell myself, yeah, I'm 5'7"", 150 is normal! But I measured myself against the wall and it turns out that 5'5"" is being generous. And yes, 150 is overweight for 5'5"". I bought new jeans today and while trying them on, I found that a pair of 9s was too small! Disgusting. I am disgusted with myself. This week has been really hard on my mental health and body image. Fickle friends and social failures. I really don't want it to turn back to anorexia's 800 calories but that's what worked last time?

I went to the dentist and she told me to stop drinking soda because the acidity destroyed my teeth. Although I have a sweet tooth, I don’t consume sugary foods. My parents raised with healthy food and I like it. 


My biggest problem now is that even though I’m taking pills for my stomach to flatten it out, it still destroys my body image. Additionally, I’m put on this non acidic diet that triggers me even more. My parents don’t know about this.

So title says it all really - I have a close friend who means a lot to me and I dont want to lose her as a friend and I want to support her with her ED. She has said she has an ED, but refuses to get help from the doctors. I understand it will take time so want to stand by her side throughout, however now we have started seeing each other again post-lockdown Ive realised how much more I monitor my food and feel dissatisfied with my own appearance after seeing her. 

I struggled with my eating in the past (from about the age of 13 along with unhealthy alcohol habits) but never got professional treatment I just got better after meeting my bf. I was at my slimmest when I met my boyfriend over 2 years ago. I have put some weight on since, but have a healthy BMI, and am much better with my food (I actually enjoy eating now!) but since seeing her I want to loose so much weight and get a slimmer waist etc. And it is definitely only after seeing her - Usually i run 3 times a week and am happy with my health and weight.

Im not sure what the best thing to do is. Im also not sure, upon reflection if I might also be fuelling her ED if this is how I feel about myself? I try hard to be supportive at the time but all she talks about is her weight and other peoples weights - I will change the topic and she’ll bring it back round.

824,824,eating_disorders,"Hi, I'm a first time poster here but I've read your off and on for a long time. I've struggled with anorexia/EDNOS for about 10 years, I'm 22 now. I've recovered once and over the past year or two have just fallen back into it. I've had lots of life changes in the meantime and am going through another big one now. 

As you know EDs come with a bunch of other mental health issues one of which is isolating yourself and alienating the people around you. Even when you feel fine and ""happy"" you lash out and just act like a bitch and only realize what you're doing a little bit later, with or without feeling guilty about it. Mostly what I do is I just ghost people unintentionally until I have the energy to reply. Of course everyone has the right and reason not to be there when I finally respond to their message or whatever but it just hurts when they aren't. 

I keep doing this and it's so hard to make friends and lately as I'm more obsessed with how much I weigh and what I eat it's getting harder to keep them. I just don't have the energy to care about anything else, especially since I have so much other shit going on in my life

Because, I struggle with my body image, I would starve myself, which was pretty easy considering that I didn’t even like eating. I was around 12 when the self starvation began, it was on-and-off behaviour since sometimes I felt pretty good but sometimes I would eat as little as 200 calories per day. 

My sister is really thin. She’s underweight due to her inability to gain weight. I see her wrists, her collarbones, her spine, and I want that. I want to be thin, I want to have thin arms and legs. She is gaining weight and I’m glad to see it, she also struggles with her body image since she wishes she were at a healthy weight. 

My dad would always say I looked ‘full’. I think about it a lot. I remember trying to become fit, in a healthy manner and he said that, and I gave up. He’s been saying it since I was little and I didn’t pay much attention to it because I didn’t care, until I did. 

I’ve never talked to anyone besides two people about my eating issues. I never told my psychiatrist nor my therapist, and I want to, I really do, but I just can’t bring myself to. I know they’ll tell my parents and they’ll make me eat; they’ll pressure me into eating. That is terrifying. The idea of someone watching me eat while making me do it is just not great. I also don’t want to tell them because I don’t want to stress my parents out about me having another mental-health-related issue. I don’t want them to be tired of me and get mad at me.

I got surgery two weeks ago and haven’t eaten much since. I’m always nauseous and I want to throw up. The most calories I’ve had since would probably be 500. I weight myself when I get the chance.

It’s my fault I got to this point. I should’ve stopped starving myself but I just couldn’t and now I barely know who hunger is. I’m not hungry anymore, all I am is dizzy and nauseous. If I eat properly I want to vomit, I’m just too full. 

I can hardly bring myself to finishing a meal. My mum made chicken with rice today and I ate two bites. I just couldn’t. Ive been in bed the past two weeks and I just can’t think.

Anyway I still have to go weighing every week and last time I lost X kg. Not intentionally I was in the hospital a appendicitis so it wasn't really my fault but everyone in the clinic, where I go for my weighing treated it as such. Like seriously I got shamed for it. I also get in trouble if I just loose a couple gramms. I eat everything on my damn meal plan sometimes even a bit more and still its always my fault. Like I can controll everything. I am 17 sometimes the meal plan is not enough and I don't notice until I get weighed.

 I think the part that annoys me the most is getting shamed for every second of sport I do. 

Even after I lost the weight because of the appendicitis I was still in a healthy bmi range, not comfortably and I do have new meal plan to get the weight back on. I have no problem with that. 

By the way I have a therapist outside of the clinic and she wants me to get tested for ADHD because after the last 6 months and some talks to my parents she seems to suspect something. 

I am just getting a bit ""therapy tired"" (Thats not a good way to translate the word I mean but it is one) with my psychiatrist and the clinic in general.

I’m 25 now and still deal with the fear of food, trying new food is so difficult and mentally draining. I can do it but it’s hard to get past how scared I feel. It’s gotten better since I turned vegetarian, I always always hated meat &amp; only ate white meat anyways (beige lol).

I got into a physically and emotionally abusive relationship when I was 14, and it ended 9 months later when I was 15, and my weight had dropped from 53kg to 41kg in those nine months. I got it back up to 44kg (it’s been 10 months since we broke up) and I can’t seem to move it. I’m stuck in this cycle of wanting to gain weight and eating lots of carbs and proteins, and then i start feeling sick after every meal and I go back to barely eating until dinner, and even then I rarely finish my dinner. And even when my brain is so motivated to eat properly again, I’ll sit down for a meal and want to cry. I don’t know why I feel this way. I hate the way I look but It’s like I also don’t want to eat to get back to how I used to look. I look thin, compared to how I used to be. 
I am absolutely self conscious of how I look, and everyone around me makes it worse. My mum will grab my arm and comment on how thin it is, take photos of me when I’m not looking and get me to look at it while she points out how skinny I am, she tells me I look horrible in certain clothes because of how skinny I am, and my dad does it too, so do some of my aunties and uncles. They say they’re just worried but they’re going about it the wrong way, they just make me feel worse. I have spoken to them multiple times about how it makes me feel and they don’t stop. 
My mum hopes for “perfect children” and does it to my older brother too, except he is overweight and when he said the only reason he got a little skinner was because he was starving himself, she said “at least you’re skinnier!” and always calls him fat.. 
I do not vomit my food out and I do eat, sometimes large amounts, so I feel this isn’t serious enough to have an “eating disorder”, but my periods are even irregular now and sometimes the thought of eating makes me so upset, and I’m constantly checking my weight on the scales, and peoples comments are making me self esteem so low. 
I don’t know what is wrong or what to do.

Once again, I’m so sorry for the long post. I would love some advice or reassurance :)",,Eating problem,3,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,n2ay09,1,Spiritual-Lemon-6330,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/n2ay09/eating_problem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/n2ay09/eating_problem/,1619842460,538,0,0,1,-1,1,"Emotional and physical abuse in a past relationship, self-consciousness about weight, negative comments from family members, irregular periods",harmful,"Feeling stuck in a cycle of wanting to gain weight but struggling to eat properly, Feeling upset or needing to cry when trying to eat, Checking weight on the scales frequently, Low self-esteem and self-consciousness about appearance, Irregular periods","Physical and emotional abuse in a past relationship, family commenting on weight and appearance in a negative way",harmful,"Experiencing a cycle of wanting to gain weight but feeling sick after meals and struggling to eat, Feeling self-conscious about appearance and checking weight frequently, Irregular periods, Emotional distress and low self-esteem","Physical and emotional abuse in a past relationship, self-consciousness about appearance, negative comments from family members",harmful,"Battling with wanting to gain weight but feeling sick after meals, Feeling upset and crying when trying to eat, Checking weight on a scale frequently, Having irregular periods"

875,875,eating_disorders,"So I've already talked to my therapist, an eating disorder specialist, close friends, family, and others about my ED, and the general consensus is that yes, I do have an eating disorder, and yes, it is almost certainly anorexia. But I decided to go to my GP as well, just to see if he had anything else to say, and also to see if he could give me an \*official\* diagnosis, because then I would feel wayyy more validated. But oh god did it backfire. I swear to god, it's like he read a book on how to invalidate someone in their ED. First of all, he didn't seem to understand that an eating disorder is a MENTAL illness, NOT a PHYSICAL illness (even though as we all know, it can have physical symptoms). He didn't ask me any questions about my thought process surrounding food/exercise, and he hardly even asked me any questions about my behaviors related to food/exercise either. Almost everything he talked about/ asked me about was in regards to the PHYSICAL signs of an ED, not the mental ones. Like one of the first things he said was ""well your weight seems to be stable,"" which isn't even true, like yes I weigh the same as I did the last time I had an appointment, but that's because A) my last appointment wasn't even that long ago and B) I was already struggling with my eating back then. But if you look at the bigger picture, from like a year ago or longer, I have definitely lost weight over time. Also WEIGHT IS NOT THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS AN ED! How many times do I have to say it -- it's a MENTAL illness, not a PHYSICAL one. So on top of that, he kept focusing on the fact that my bloodwork came back normal (except for my hemoglobin or something), so I don't appear to be malnourished. Again, focusing on physical symptoms rather than mental causes. And then he wrapped it up by saying ""well, I think it's good that you're trying to do something about this now while it's not that bad before it gets worse."" Cue the whole ""I'm not sick enough"" overthinking spiral.

In summary, the healthy part of my brain is pissed off and knows that he doesn't know what he's talking about. But the ED part of my brain is like ""SEE??!! You're not sick enough! If you had lost more weight then he'd take you seriously. Now you need to keep losing weight and eating poorly until it gets 'bad enough' to earn a diagnosis! But until then, you're not valid!""

884,884,eating_disorders,"I (25F) scored my (current) dream job working remote for a tech company based out of NYC about 2 months ago. 

I have never not succeeded in a job. I have always be proud of my work ethic and confident in my future success. This is my first remote job, specifically remote training. But I have been wfh for the past year due to covid so I figured that eventually I would ramp at a normal speed, if not just slightly slower. Well I was wrong.

Today my boss put me on probation due to my “poor performance and lack of significant progress”. I have two weeks to get my shit together or they will let me go. This came out of absolutely no where as far as the signs my boss gave me that things were in bad shape (there were no signs). That said, I figured this day would come eventually. 

I started using laxatives and restrictive eating at the being of quarantine in April 2020. It’s been a year and I am now binging/purging and/or starving myself everyday. Ive always suffered from obsessive behaviors and anxiety, and combined that with living alone in my apartment for 7 weeks with nothing to do but cook, eat, and smoke, I became rather fixated with losing weight quickly and easily. 

I’ve lost about 15 pounds in the last year, nothing completely shocking but it is the thinnest I’ve been since high school. I look good. Trendy clothes that I would never have worn even in college fit me now. People have noticed my weight loss, though most of them congratulate me (oof). 

But my brain is literally garbage. I have a next to no short term memory. I have a difficult time forming cohesive thoughts and sentences. I’m exhausted, achy, and slow every single day. I drink two ice coffees each morning, and typically binge a large high calorie meal (chipotle, burgers + fries, multiple boxes of Mac n cheese) after work and purge it immediately after. 

I know that my ED is almost entirely to blame for my atypical failure at work. My body tells me every day by barely making it to 5pm without a nap, and immediately responding with a boost of focus and energy whenever I cave and eat a snack midday. And despite knowing how wrong it is that I’m doing this to my body and brain, and how out of control I know I’ve become, I’m just not ready to tell anyone yet. 

So, what do I do? Am I really about to let myself lose my job because I can’t tell my manager or hr? I honesty just can’t imagine telling my boss, a person I have never met in person and barely know, I have an ED over a fucking zoom call?

I just recently got into a relationship. Things are looking up for me. I'm happier than I've been in any other relationship I've had before. Now don't get me wrong, my boyfriend is an amazing guy. He makes me feel so very on top of the world, and I'm not uncomfortable around him. I just cannot eat around him.

While I haven't been clinically diagnosed, I've been binge eating for about five (5) years now. The thought of eating in front of people hasn't really had an effect on me until maybe like two (2) years ago. Before, I would jump at the opportunity to go out to lunch or have nice dinners with friends. Things have changed recently. With family stuff and the pandemic, the thought of eating around people makes me utterly sick to my stomach. The only people I can really eat out with at a restaurant is my immediate family, and even then they're the source of the problem. I don't even like eating with them or making food because all they do is stare me down and make rude comments about the way I food or the food I eat.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day 2021. Boyfriend invites me over for a nice dinner that his mom had cooked. As much as I had wanted to eat the food she made for us, I couldn't bring myself to. I really wanted to skip and just celebrate next year, but I knew he had put in a lot of effort. So I came over. Everything was good until he wanted to eat, and not going to lie I was getting hungry. I wasn't trying to wait until I got home either. So I agreed to eat. We head to the kitchen and I took for for myself, and he took food for himself. As we sat down, I couldn't help but notice that my plate had more food than his. I felt full instantly.  We both had stopped eating, and he kinda just took out food away without me saying anything. 

I explain to him how I felt that night a few days after. He says I have nothing to worry about, that I shouldn't feel bad for eating more than him because he had eaten earlier before I came and wasn't all that hungry.

A couple weeks later, restrictions are slightly lifted and now you are allowed to go to restaurants with people who are not members of your household. We had been talking about going to restaurants when restrictions allow and when it is safe to do so. So I suggest the idea of going out to eat pho! I had never eaten it before and I wanted to try it and then go for a walk. He was on board. The idea was good in my head until I actually started thinking about what I had agreed to. The thought of me eating in front of him made me sick instantly and thinking about how many calories I would've consumed in front of him made me feel even more shitty. So I told him everything and cancelled. He consoled me and said it was okay, but that he would love to eat at a restaurant with me when I was ready.

But how do I get ready? I want to eat at a nice restaurant or even be all sloppy with my food around him without feeling scared or ashamed or embarrassed.

Some background info:
I have severe ADD and tend to hyper fixate on different foods (ex. Only eating tuna salad and crackers for 2 weeks). I take concerta everyday for the ADD which is an appetite suppressant and forget to eat at times.  I was recently plant based and focus on only eating foods within those options, however I still ate fish. Currently I’m struggling in nursing school and am constantly studying or going to class. If I’m not studying I’m thinking about studying or what I’m supposed to being doing and am stressed/overwhelmed to the MAX. On top of all of this I also have untreated anxiety (diagnosed) and can’t sleep or eat when I’m stressed. 

The issue:
At the beginning of December I weighed 106-109 pounds. I weigh 92 now. I have stopped the plant based diet to try and regain the weight but I don’t remember to eat until 10:30-11 at night and only manage to eat a small amount of food. That’s typically the only time I eat. Some days I don’t take my concerta to try and see if I’ll eat but I still don’t. I KNOW I’m losing weight and I need to gain it back but at the same time it’s like I don’t want too. I don’t weigh myself regularly or stare at myself in the mirror. At this point I’m developing a thigh gap which I’ve NEVER had and can’t eat more than a small amount without feeling full. I’m constantly cold and I have basically no muscle left. I’m so confused because I know it’s not healthy and I know it’s not good for me but I don’t think I want to gain the weight back. I just keep watching it fall off. If I weighed myself today and it read 98 pounds I think that I’d stop myself from eating, but if I dropped to 89 I’d think “maybe we should eat something”.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been happy with my body for a long time. Never in my 14 years of life have I ever thought there was anything wrong with it up until now. All my life I've been told ""Wow you're so tiny"", ""You're so skinny."" I've been asked things like : ""Do you even eat?"", 'Do you purge/ have an ED?"" And to the last one, I'd always say no. People have fit their entire hands over my wrists, hell, I can almost do that. For some reason I've always liked being told and asked these things. It reassured me I guess. A little over a year ago I think, I had a doctor's appointment to refill a medication. When I was weighed, I was told I was 81-83 pounds. That was a week where I hadn't really eaten much of anything. But that was different. I had an appetite back then. Recently, another doctor's appointment to refill a medication, and to be prescribed antidepressants. This time, I weighed at 94 pounds. And then that's when the thoughts started pouring in: ""I have to fix this"", ""I can't eat for a little while, then this will be solved"". I've completely lost my appetite. I will eat something like chips, a small serving of eggs, anything small. Occasionally a small bit of my school lunch. But when dinner rolls around it's not so easy. A few weeks before this, I had been brought dinner. I wasn't hungry. So I just set the plate in my bed side table drawer to rot. Then we see today. Me, a few minutes away from typing this post, throwing away the food in the dumpster outside my apartment complex and soaking the plate in hot water. The same thing happened to last nights dinner. I begrudgingly took a few bites and set it aside until this morning. I threw it away, soaked the bowl in hot water. I was with my therapist yesterday and we ate at sonic as we talked. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. That was the biggest portion of food I'd had all week. A little recently I notice that If I put my hand into to position where I could see my tendons protruding, only two were visible. That was when I really thought there was an issue. Not only that but I will sometimes examine the amount of fat on my face, and if my torso is at all anywhere away from an hour glass shape I panic.

919,919,eating_disorders,"This is a crosspost from r/mentalhealth. I edited it slightly.

 I don't really know where to start... Basically, I think I \*might\* have an eating disorder. I know that reddit is not the place to go for medical advice/a diagnosis, but I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just a discussion. Also, I'm afraid to tell anyone about this irl because I honestly don't want them to stop me from losing weight. Which could be a red flag that it's an eating disorder. But at the same time, I feel like it's not extreme/severe enough to be an eating disorder. Idk.

So basically I'm trying to lose weight, and I have been for a while. I have lost a few pounds, but not much. I'm not doing anything super extreme, like crash diets or not eating for days, which is what normally comes to mind when one pictures an eating disorder. Really all I've been doing is using MyFitnessPal to track my calories, and I have it set to ""lose 1 lb/week"" which is not that bad, and sometimes I don't even reach that goal. So this probably doesn't sound like an eating disorder at all, just normal/healthy weight loss. But the thing is, I'm already technically underweight, according to BMI (my BMI is 18.1 -- but I've heard of anorexics with a BMI of 16 or less, so I guess this isn't really that bad). Yet I still want to lose weight. And logically, I know that this is f\*cked up and not healthy, mentally or physically, but I can't help but want to lose weight. See, the thing is I KNOW I'm not fat; logically, I KNOW I don't NEED to lose weight. I don't look in the mirror and ""see a fat person"" -- like I don't look in the mirror and just hallucinate fat rolls that just aren't there. But it's more like, I look in the mirror, and I think to myself ""I could be skinnier, I wish I was skinnier, I would look so much better if I was skinnier"" Or on the other hand, instead of looking at the whole picture, I zoom in on certain parts of my body, parts that have any bodyfat on them at all and think ""ugh I just wish I could get rid of THAT. I wish that \[insert body part here\] was smaller, thinner, firmer, etc."" Also, every time I see another person (especially girls/women, since I am female) who appears to be thinner than me, I find myself comparing myself to them and feeling really jealous and wishing I was skinnier, and then being mad at myself for not being skinny enough.

So I guess what I'm saying is that I don't think I'm restricting my calories enough for it to be considered an eating disorder. Like when I think of an eating disorder, I think of someone who only eats like maybe 500 calories a day or less. But I always eat around 1500-2000 probably. However does my mindset around food/body image and that fact that I'm underweight mean that it could be an eating disorder?

Also, a few other details that might be important:

1. I am very active. I run several miles every day, and I also dance, walk around a lot, and do workout classes at the gym like yoga and cycling.
2. I have forced myself to throw up before (for the purpose of losing weight/to avoid weight gain), but it's not something I do all the time. I've only done it maybe 5 or 6 times ever, and 3 times in the past month.
3. I am in therapy and take meds for diagnosed depression and anxiety. (But I haven't talked about anything in this post with my therapist.)
4. People in my life often tell me that I am too skinny, should gain weight, should eat more, etc. This includes people like my mom, my brother, my friends, and even my boyfriend.

TL;DR: I think I might have an eating disorder, but I'm not sure if it's bad enough to \*actually\* be an eating disorder. I count my calories, but I don't restrict to an extreme level. I am physically active. I am underweight, but not severely: BMI is 18.1. I have body image issues, and it's not that I see myself as ""fat,"" but rather that I wish I was skinnier and want to eradicate any bit of fat on my body. I've made myself throw up a few times, but not on a regular basis. I have depression and anxiety. Do I have an eating disorder? If not, do I have body dysmorphia, or anything else like that? Or is this just normal?

I know no one on here can actually diagnose me but I wanted to see if this sounds like an ED to y’all because I’m starting to scare myself. I’m a 20 year old female who, as a senior in highschool, ran into some issues. I only ate a meal a day for about 2 weeks and lost 10 pounds, along with trying to make myself throw up. I went from 120-110 at the time but eventually stopped doing that. Flash forward I’m a junior in college and I’ve lost about 10-15 pounds in the last 2 weeks-a month. Eating more than a meal a day freaks me out and my calorie intake is all I think about. I’m at 130 now and was at 140 which is a healthy weight for a 5’5 girl, but I’m no where near happy and don’t want to stop. It’s addictive and I’m scared. It’s torture. I struggle with pretty bad OCD and learned that BDD is very closely related so that seems very probable to me. Basically, I don’t like to eat and when I do I often feel sick.

922,922,eating_disorders,"After years of binge-eating during stressful situations and feeling horrible about myself and my body, I (19e) (e stands for enby, aka, non-binary) finally broke tonight and made myself throw up my dinner. 

Before throwing up I went on a binge and had 3 different dishes (one of which I stole from a friend bc I ran out of food but was desperate to eat; I already apologized and I feel guilty as hell for eating it). I was horribly bloated by the end of it and just couldn't handle the guilt and the sight of my huge belly sticking out. 

I think the reason I've done this is bc lately I've been feeling a lot of pressure in my life; pressure to do well in school (I'm struggling with studying), to stay in the closet, etc, and I've been feeling lonelier and lonelier without seeing my friends irl due to covid. 

I feel like there's so many expectations of me that I can't live up to and that I'm constantly letting people down. I'm constantly thinking that i'm a horrible person so I do things like steal food from a friend to see if they realise how horrible I am and leave me.

923,923,eating_disorders,"Apologies if this comes off as a rant, I'm just quite upset by all of this and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here, so I thought I'd go to Reddit for help.

So, to keep this as brief as possible, I was just having dinner with my family. We had quiche and my dad commented that my mum hadn't eaten her crusts. She said that she'd gained weight recently (which, according to her, she always is) and that was why. I said that she shouldn't trust her scales, that her weight fluctuates throughout the day, and that nutritionists recommend not focusing on the number. My brother started making fun of my weight, so I kicked him under the table (not great on my part, I'm fully aware). My parents weren't happy for obvious reasons, and the conversation escalated.

My mum said that she knew more because she had over 30 years more experience. I said that all that meant was that she has been exposed to the toxicity of diet culture for longer, while my generation have been exposed to body diversity and positivity movements as well. She snapped that she wouldn't take advice from someone who's weight yo-yos so much.

As you might be able to understand, this really hurt my feelings. I've got a history with disordered eating from my teen years and had a relapse last year, so this was really painful to hear. However, my parents don't know about any of this history.

My dad instinctively supported my mum, said that I shouldn't complain that she commented on my weight gain because I commented on how much she eats. I would never comment on my mum's body because I know the harm this can do, but I could literally tell you exactly what she eats everyday and it's under 1200 calories. I feel really guilty commenting on how much she eats, but as I've said I'm highlighting her under-eating while she highlights me eating a normal amount of food, which is really triggering considering my history.

How should I talk to my dad about this?

He's a good husband so he will instinctively take my mum's side no matter what, but it feels like he's just enabling. Also, my mum's consistent comments on whether I should have a second serving, that I've gained weight, etc. are so painful for me to hear, and partly triggered my disordered eating (as well as my brother's constantly calling me fat and ugly even when I was underweight). My mum's comments only dwindle when I'm a lower weight and eating less.

And, finally, how can I navigate these arguments? I always come off as such a know-it-all and I have such an awful temper, but I also am the most passive person ever so I always roll over when I get into an argument :((

Sorry that this didn't end up brief lol, thanks for any advice or support, either would be appreciated because I don't have anyone to talk to about this ://",,How to deal with family's hurtful comments?,23,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,malga9,1,FlimsyCompetition722,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/malga9/how_to_deal_with_familys_hurtful_comments/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/malga9/how_to_deal_with_familys_hurtful_comments/,1616413149,507,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments and criticism from family members about weight and eating habits, exposure to toxic diet culture",harmful,"The writer has a history of disordered eating, which is triggered by their family members' comments about their weight and eating habits, The writer is struggling to navigate arguments with their family members and feels guilty about commenting on their mother's eating habits",Negative comments on weight and eating habits from family members,harmful,"Triggering for the person with a history of disordered eating, Causing feelings of guilt and shame, Family members are not supportive or understanding of the person’s struggles",Family members making negative comments about weight and eating habits,harmful,"The negative comments from family members are triggering for the writer, who has a history of disordered eating, The argument with family members is causing emotional distress for the writer"
924,924,eating_disorders,"I really like this guy I am with at this moment. We are together and hangout out on some days. We are getting serious. I love the way he makes me feel as if I am worth loving. I hate having an eating disorder. The thought of being loved for who I am - my personality and body- scares me. It makes me want to stop having these thoughts to want to restrict. We have been friends for 2 1/2 years on and off since I have been unable to keep my emotions in check. Before we used to fight over not me wanting to hang out and not opening up to the reason why. Whenever I restrict, I feel normal, I have the motivation to hang out. Because at that moment it feels like food doesn't control me, I control it.  Whenever I go into a period of overeating to an excessive amount, I feel like everyone hates me because I am ""fat"". I don't know why restricting makes me feel happy and calm. It's weird since at the same time I am so tired and in pain. It scares me to feel the wanting of food and eating not in control. On days where I try to eat a normal amount to ""recover"", I just eat in such excess without control. Anyway, whenever I was with him, he said that he liked my body and I should not try to change myself.  I am mainly writing this since I want to try and stop wanting to change myself. What is so stupid about an eating disorder for me is that I am ok with my body rn. But I don't want to stop restricting and hating myself. It seems the easiest way to give me happiness. The constant self-deprecating thoughts and the restriction is my normal. I constantly just want to get worse. Getting worse is what I am looking forward to, but I don't want him to get in my way. I don't want to lose him as I care for him, but feeling cared for is just interesting. He doesn't like me becoming distant and self-sabotaging our relationship since it is emotionally manipulative. Punishment by ending relationships gives me a high and another reason to restrict. Feeling worthless is comforting sadly. He is someone that deserves better and if I do anything bad he will probably leave me. I feel bad for him sometimes as he blindsided by the awful things that I have done.

“you should start working out” 
“if you eat all this you’ll start complaining about being fat again” and so on. 

this lead me to a point of hiding food under my shirt or in my pants or generally just out of her sight so i can go to my room and eat it. i got so paranoid i started hiding it from my dad as well in fear he’d tell her. for a good amount of time i couldn’t stop eating even though i wanted to. i’d feel disgusted and so so so guilty but i just couldn’t stop and as much as i hate to admit it, i still can’t. it gets a little complex though, cause i’ll have periods of time where i completely starve myself the entire day, eat nothing and lie to everyone about having eaten already but then there are periods of time where i’ll do the former.

i started working out today, and my family ordered pizza and spring rolls, which was really tempting considering my dad told me to come eat. i told him i didn’t want, thinking i’ll eat a salad later since i just worked out, but he insisted and i went downstairs but only ate some spring rolls. i felt so guilty. i was about to go take a shower (mind you, i’m emetophobic; i have an intense fear of vomiting, especially since last time i vomited i ended up fainting) and i thought about it. i was about to induce vomiting but my brother knocked on the door wanting to use the bathroom, and i snapped out of it. i was literally shaking. i didn’t get to vomit but i’m so so so scared i’ll end up trying it again. in fact, i know i will. my intrusive thoughts won’t leave me alone right now and i don’t know if i trust myself to be alone. i probably sound crazy. i don’t know why i’m writing this, i guess i don’t know who to turn to.",,"developing an eating disorder, i think.",5,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,m5jmoi,1,apetite-for-chaos,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/m5jmoi/developing_an_eating_disorder_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/m5jmoi/developing_an_eating_disorder_i_think/,1615811383,408,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments about weight from mother, hiding food, periods of bingeing and starving, fear of vomiting, intrusive thoughts",harmful,"Development of negative relationship with food due to mother’s comments, Hiding food and feeling paranoid about eating, Bingeing and starving periods, Fear of vomiting leading to thoughts of inducing vomiting, Intrusive thoughts causing fear and anxiety",Negative comments from mother about weight and food,harmful,"Developed a negative relationship with food and their body, Paranoia and hiding food from family members, Periods of binge eating and periods of starving themselves, Intense fear of vomiting and thoughts of inducing vomiting after eating","Negative comments about body and food from mother, hiding food, periods of overeating and starvation, fear of vomiting, intrusive thoughts",harmful,"Developed a negative relationship with food due to mother’s comments, Hides food from family and feels guilty about eating, Experiences periods of overeating and starvation, Fear of vomiting and intrusive thoughts lead to desire to induce vomiting, Brother interrupts and prevents vomiting"

946,946,eating_disorders,"The thing is I've researched it and my symptoms are kinda all over the place and don't match up with one type of eating disorder. Getting weighed at the doctor's office always sends me into a spiral and I usually restrict for a couple days after. I feel prettier when I'm starving. It wasn't always bad. As a kid (I'm 17 now) I'd always eat freely and I wouldn't think anything of it. But when I was 14, I was in the hospital for appendicitis for 5 days. I didn't eat or drink during that so I lost hella weight. After that, I restricted when ever I wanted to rapidly lose weight (for a party or something). I thought I have it under control. When I'm not restricting, I'd eat normally but feel internally guilty about it or I'd be thinking 'I shouldn't be eating this, put it down'. It went on like this for a while. Restricting for a few days and then eating for a few but feeling shame that I did. But recently, I was eating and I choked and that caused me to throw up. Afterwards, I felt immense relief. Like I was glad that I threw up because it stopped me eating. Now, I'm getting into a habit of restricting often and purging any big meal I eat. If I don't purge it and try to force it down, I just feel physically sick and bloated and that triggers me to restrict. I've lost a lot of weight, in an unhealthy way and my mother is praising me for it. I don't see it though and I still don't feel like it's enough. I weigh myself everyday and obsess over the number. If I gain some slightly, I'm weak and I have no self control. Do I have an eating disorder?

Then I went to secondary school. I used to skip breakfast and lunch and then just eat everything at home. Is that a pack of crisps? Guess I'm going to have to eat the whole 150g bag! This was a constant repeated cycle until the weekend where I used to eat as much as I wanted and then I would go to school and, well it would happen again and again. I would eat all my junk in secret because I felt ashamed by it.

When  the coronavirus came, and we had to stay inside, i used to eat tons of junk food and eat lots of snacks out of boredom. I used to feel so bad about myself and then I'd eat more out of sadness.

Then I was allowed to go back to school, and I started to skip breakfast and eat lunch at school and eat whatever I wanted to at home. I really didn't want to eat lunch but only did because my mum was worried about me not eating breakfast or lunch.

Then, we have our current lockdown (from January to now). I started counting calories in January but only did it for less than a week because i started to become scared when i thought i had eaten too many calories.  Then in February, I started to intermittent fast (16:8) and it has been going pretty well! Since the end of February, I started to eat less and less, and I practically don't feel very hungry.  i only eat one actual meal a day(to break my fast). I constantly tell myself that I don't need to eat even when I know I should. I've recently started to count my calories again just to watch what I eat and I want to lose some weight and I realise I don't even eat my BMR!!

I'm a little worried about this and it would be really helpful to get some insight.



Additional info: 
-My mum tells me that I've been losing a lot of weight (since July of last year) but I just don't see it. She thinks I might have body dysmorphia became of this.
When checked my weight on the scale in December, I actually had put on 2KG so I decided to exercise more.

- I've recently begun to have irregular sleeps. Normally I'd sleep 8.5 hrs or how ever long I wanted to sleep, but now I go bed at roughly 11:30pm and wake up at 6:30-7:00 am. I feel so tired all times of the day.

- I am constantly thinking about my weight, and what to eat or if I should go on more walks to burn a lot more calories. 

- since Christmas, I've lost 3 inches off my waist and 4 off of my thighs. I've lost more inches around my arms and legs.

I am now currently 15yrs old, 5'3, and 70kg (last time I checked was February 26th)

960,960,eating_disorders,"Long rant so apologies in advance. I am 25 years old and live with my mom.(times are tough). Anyway, I do want to lose weight but my mother seems to project unhealthy behaviors onto me. She says I need to count every single calorie like if I add a tablespoon of mustard or ketchup to a Hot Dog or something like that. 

She also feels the need to tell me how many calories are in a meal that either her or I are going to eat. And raves about how low in calories something she has is in. She also tells me her future meals and how little calories they’re going to have in them.

This behavior has been going on since my childhood. With questions like “okay if you realllyyyy want to eat that?” Or “are you sure you want to eat that?” And comments like “she’s a vacuum shell eat everything” and stuff like “you just ate” and “you’re going to eat all that?!” Or “i can’t believe you just ate all that!” She has told me to drink more water and to drink before a meal to not as much. 

It makes me super self conscious especially eating in public. I feel like people secretly judge me while eating because of these comments in the past. She also keeps pressuring me into telling her my weight. “How much do you weight? Do you weigh this much? Just tell me” I just feel like it’s something me and my doctor need to know. I don’t need to make my weight public.

At 13 I started starving myself with 600 calories a day and lost a ton of weight. I didn’t think of it as a disorder but as a “crash diet”. It did come back on tho (and quickly) but I used to think it was normal and that’s what crash dieting was. My mom didn’t even seem to notice even though I was pretty open about starving myself. She just seemed content with me losing weight. I even think I brought it up to her at one point but she just shrugged it off and said it’s your body I can’t force you to do anything. 

Part of me thinks I messed up my metabolism as a teenager and now I can’t lose any weight because of it. I am thinking of seeing a dietician when I am able to work again. 

As a child, my mom always pointed out bigger women and ask me “am I as fat as her?” “Look at that lady! Do I look that fat?” Now as an adult, I feel compelled to compare myself to other people.

Ok so  I have been very insecure about my weight for a while now. When I eat a lot I feel really guilty and this past school year I’ve been eating less. I decided to stop eating breakfast at the beginning of the school year and later tried to avoid eating on the weekends (I eat school lunches and my friends ask questions when I’m not at lunch). The past few weeks though I’ve been eating less and less. From eating just my lunch at school (often getting seconds), to trying to eat very little to nothing at lunch everyday. I try to avoid food at home unless it’s fruit or something healthy. Anyways the point I’m trying to get to is that in gym class a little less than half way through the class I get light headed and feel weak. Feeling like I could pass out. Have I developed and eating disorder? Is this lightheadedness most likely cause by my not eating much? If someone could help me out here that would be nice.

for nearly a year now, i’ve been restricting my food intake and i don’t know why, i want to gain weight extremely badly i really really don’t like being skinny, but for some reason i constantly just don’t eat, it’s almost like i’m pushing myself to see how long i can go without eating before i have to? and recently i’ve been keeping note of roughly how many calories i eat in a day and it’s nearly always below 1000. i eat some marmite on toast in the morning, eat absolutely nothing all day long and then at tea time i eat maximum of half of whatever is there, i don’t know why but when i try to eat it makes me feel sick and as if i’m going to throw up. i honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me i’m literally crying rn cause i know i don’t have anorexia as i don’t want to lose weight but i just have such a bad relationship with food and every time i wear tight or revealing clothes every single person around me comments on how skinny i look, so i always just go back to wearing baggy stuff again. i don’t know what to do and i know i’m making myself ill because i have absolutely no energy at all, i’ve had other mental health problems since i was really younger as well as this and i feel sick and grouchy all the time and i cannot help myself no matter what i do",,please help i don’t know if i have an ed or what it is,7,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,lrrngi,1,bootyjigglemuncher,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/lrrngi/please_help_i_dont_know_if_i_have_an_ed_or_what/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/lrrngi/please_help_i_dont_know_if_i_have_an_ed_or_what/,1614213018,391,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative body image, restricting food intake, fear of eating, and lack of energy",harmful,"Obsessive thoughts about body image and constantly wearing baggy clothes, Restricting food intake and keeping track of calories, Feeling sick and grouchy all the time and lacking energy","Obsession with body image, restricting food intake, fear of eating, negative comments about body from others",harmful,"Constantly thinking about the way she looks and hating it, Restricting food intake despite wanting to gain weight, Feeling sick and unable to eat when trying to eat, Negative comments from others about her body, Experiencing physical symptoms such as fatigue and irritability","Poor body image, restricting food intake, negative comments about weight and appearance",harmful,"Obsession with appearance and body image, Restricting food intake and eating less than 1000 calories a day, Feeling sick and grouchy all the time and having no energy, Negative comments about weight and appearance are triggering and cause the writer to revert back to wearing baggy clothes"

Hey so im writing here cause i cant discuss it with anyone else and im afraid they might tell my parents and tell them that i need help. 
Okay so this has been going on for about a year and i was obese (84kg) last year in feb but then i started restricting my diet to eating just dinner which would be no more than 800 calories. Back then my parents wont care as they just thought i was dieting to lose weight and I’ll stop when i get to my ideal weight but over the course of one year I’ve reached 60kg which is normal weight for my height and age. But i still cant get myself to feel comfortable and eat more than 500 calories now and if i feel like I’ve eaten a bit more than that may it be 50 calories only i would go and purge out the food. Back in November i purged regularly for about 20 days then stopped for a week then started again and now its on and off now. I got covid in January and felt guilty for not being able to purge as i was on medications and purging would take them out as well. I check my weight everyday and if i lose one kg then the day goes good but if the weighing scale shows the same number or worse that it has risen it makes my whole day shit. I cant stop comparing myself and whenever i look in the mirror i feel fat and think that im eating more and continue to restrict it more.

980,980,eating_disorders,"Hey! I [F20] really started worrying about my weight about a year ago. I've always had these phases of either not caring at all what I eat where I would most days eat over my daily caloric recommendation or then, count every calorie I eat and make sure to eat just right. Normally these phases last a few months and then switch to the other one.

However, I have now been stuck on the calorie counting phase. I eat super unhealthy but I still somehow manage to stay under the calorie recommendation. I am totally normal weight but I get veeeery anxious if I don't know how many calories some food has and often insist on making my own foods because of it. I also try to 'save' my calories for the nights so that I can binge which means that I'm eating max 800 calories during the day and in the evening, 1000 cals in one sitting. 

I also feel that my body image changes daily, after eating I have to check my body to see if it feels any different, and I also need to weigh myself daily (sometimes multiple times a day) to be sure that I haven't put on weight. I'm on the 'lower' side of normal weight but would still love to be a few kilograms lighter.

982,982,eating_disorders,"So I’ve been overweight/obese pretty much my whole life. I’ve always been a binge eater and emotional eater. I just love food. 
A few months ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and it changed everything. We caught it quite early so I don’t need to take medication or insulin so it is completely controlled by my diet.

As soon as I got my diagnosis, I immediately started the Keto diet as I heard that it was good for diabetics. I also cut my calories down to 1800 a day. After a while, though, I felt like if I got too close to my limit I was eating too much. Now, I beat myself up if I get to/over 1000. I’ll stay in bed as long as I can in the morning because I know as soon as I get out I’ll want to eat and I want to give myself as little time to eat as I can. 

My blood sugar levels now are that of a non diabetic and I’m proud of that but now my focus has shifted to my weight. My partner tells me how noticeably smaller I am but I can’t see it.
I know that I have lost some weight but it doesn’t feel like enough. My partner is getting frustrated with me because I beat myself up so much over it. I’m worried that no matter how much I lose, it will never be enough and I’ll still be afraid to eat. 

It’s not that I hate food now, I still want it all the time. I’m just terrified to eat any what I call “no-no foods”. I feel happier when I eat 700 calories a day then when I eat 1800. I know a banana won’t kill me, but I’m still afraid of it. I know I won’t gain back all the weight I lost if I eat a sandwich once, but the thought of having one makes me genuinely scared.

I feel like because of my weight and how it’s only been a few months, I can’t classify this as an eating disorder. While my partner has expressed genuine concern about my current eating habits, my mother has praised me for it and even seemed surprised that I haven’t lost more weight. I feel like overweight people aren’t taken seriously when they under eat because that’s what we “should be” doing.

we’re fraternal twins, and i’ve always been the “skinnier/smaller” one ever since we were really young. no one’s really ever pointed it out or said anything about our weight, but it was visibly obvious. also, i’ve always been a little shorter and had a smaller appetite, so my mom would constantly nag me to eat more. we’ve never had any issues regarding our weight and diet until now. 

i’m guessing that recently, something incentivized her to suddenly want to lose weight. but her method is so strange? she keeps track of what i eat and how much I eat everyday, and uses that as a gauge for what and how much SHE should eat. i know that it’s something that’s pretty normal among siblings, comparing everything, but this is just messed up. 

my mom has been made aware of it before and she had a talk with my sister about it, at the end of which she said she would no longer do this. however, earlier today i caught my sister STILL writing down what i eat on her phone. 

not only is this unhealthy for her (bc she naturally has a bigger appetite and she’s suddenly restricting so much), it’s also stressful for me to know that someone is tracking what i eat and how many calories i consume every time i eat. 

it bothers me so much, but i don’t know how to stop her from doing it. i’m the only one who knows about this other than my mom, but she thinks my sister stopped. what should i do? can someone please tell me how i can stop her from doing this?",,i found out my sister is secretly keeping track of everything i eat,32,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,lm0fpe,1,tiphannie,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/lm0fpe/i_found_out_my_sister_is_secretly_keeping_track/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/lm0fpe/i_found_out_my_sister_is_secretly_keeping_track/,1613584715,351,0,0,0,-1,1,Sister tracking what the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causing stress and discomfort for the writer, Unhealthy for the sister who is restricting her food intake",Sister tracking what the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causes stress and discomfort for the writer, Potentially encourages unhealthy eating habits and restriction for the sister",Twin sister keeping track of everything the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causing stress and discomfort for the writer, Unhealthy for the sister who is restricting despite having a bigger appetite"

1004,1004,eating_disorders,"Throwaway for this. I dont know if I have an eating disorder. My parents are worried that I do because they dont think I eat enough, i think I'm fine, but i dont know if I'm in denial or what. I like to think I'm fairly self-aware, but i dont know.

Over the last week or so I've been eating very little, almost nothing except dinner. Whenever I eat dinner I immediately feel completely stuffed, even if it wasnt that much. This never used to happen but now I feel like I'm going to get sick whenever I eat. The last three days I've been vomiting some of my dinner up. But it's only because I feel too full, and i dont vomit _that much_ its just a little off the top so that I dont feel stuffed anymore. 

Whenever I eat I feel nauseous and its difficult to chew because of that. I find myself shaking all the time, and I'm cold quite often even when its warm.

The reason I have a lot of doubt about this, is that I dont really have a terrible weight image. I used to when I was younger, I was very very obsessed with how fat I looked. I dont think I'm that fat anymore, just a little bit of a belly and it doesnt show up under a hoodie.

I do have body image issues, but they're not weight, it's mostly gender dysphoria. It's very bad, but I dont think weight or anything is that big of a factor in it.

I'm just really confused. I dont think this is that unhealthy but I dunno. I dont even vomit up all of my dinner just a bit off the top.

I'm posting cause I just dont know about any of this and I'm looking for help as to whether this is normal or if my parents are right and theres a problem here. (They dont know I've been vomiting).

im just sad. It's sad to think how proud i was of being that itty bitty (107lbs),, ofc my eating habits were very poor and the world was actually running, so I had places to be and had school which involved exercise (i dance for school productions), but then i got really really low. Like it was very very bad, I remember that summer while i was flaunting my skinny/toned bod i wasnt eating nearly enough and it got so bad that i had horrible headaches and the shakes and they wouldnt go away unless i ate or drank water. I mostly survived off dunkin donuts iced coffee and acai bowls (the only food i would eat bc it was full of antioxidants and that sounded pretty good for a bowl full of natures candy), but then I went to the mental hospital (i was there for 6 days) and it was surprisingly easy to skip meals because everyday they had some sort of meat that I didn't eat (I don't eat red meat) so i would pick up one or two things that I knew would be appetizing--- IM ALSO SUCH A PICKY EATER!!!!!!! that should be noted bc it makes sense why i was so selective with my food.

1016,1016,eating_disorders,"Hi,

Not sure where else to go / vent so here seemed the best place. I have PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome) which is a very common hormonal disorder among women. Among symptoms like acne, depression, hair loss, facial hair.... weight gain (despite being in a calorie deficit), and infertility are key symptoms. 

I have struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. I used to be overweight, then changed my diet, and am now a 'normal' weight (not skinny, still have some fat rolls, but not overweight). I hate my body, all I see is fat. Despite exercising 5 days a week, eating rediculously healthy (I do eat a 'normal' amount, Id say I eat about 1,550 cal a day, and 3 meals &amp; a snack), I cannot loose weight- which is all part of my condition (inability to loose weight is very common due to messed up hormones). As a result, my relationship with food is bad &amp; getting worse. I know that having a list of 'good' and 'bad' foods is typical of eating disorders, for example not allowing bread, sweets, ect, but my problem is that with PCOS, it is \*proven\* that consuming refined carbs (white bread, white pasta, sugar, ect) worsens the condition, so it seems reasonable to have a list of 'off limit' or 'once in a blue moon' foods (remembering infertility is a side effect of PCOS so this plays on my mind a LOT).  How can I possibly have a good relationship with food when anything nice is bad for me... caffeine? nope because I have adrenal problems. Sugar? Worst thing for me, as I'm insulin resistant. Dairy? Spikes insulin levels. Carbs? A low carb diet is the best option for insulin resistant PCOS... I do all this, and I am still chunky, and miserable. my friends eat what they want/ start to eat a little healthier and get abs/ loose weight and keep it off. I am sick of having this. I feel so so alone. I can't eat chocolate without feeling guilt, even when I eat an apple I feel guilt as its sugar. I can see this is a slippery slope to a very bad relationship with food and I don't know what to do...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I restrict even more to get to my ideal weight then stop? Or should I just eat what I want in moderation, accept my body &amp; hope that I will be happy like this? For anyone with a relationship with food similar to mine, when you got a better relationship were you happier?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice/ anyone in a similar position please let me know your thoughts..

1022,1022,eating_disorders,I am sixteen and have been struggling with eating disorders for the previous two years or so.

I also am struggling with restricting when I am able to go a couple days with no bingeing after my fasting compensation is done.  I am struggling so much everyday  and me continuously obsessing over calories and eating is negatively affecting my ability to complete my class assignments  and ruining my relationships with my family members and friends.  Eating stresses me  due to how much time I am wasting with tracking every calorie and obssessing over ensuring I am staying below my daily maximum.  Despite this  I am still bingeing every two or three days on average  which leads me to purge  then begin restricting again.  I have nobody who I can discuss this with  and my parents have no clue  so I am unable to begin getting help or getting into counseling.  This binge eating and obssessing over calories has been causing me to have depression  and I am really struggling.  Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can begin recovering?

I'm an ftm trans guy who is almost 2 years on T (4 more months!). I'm also someone who has had an eating disorder in the past. I've been recovering from it for about 10 months and it's been kind of alright, no relapses, just occasional bad thoughts. however lately these thoughts have been really bad. I'm really self conscious of my thighs and hips since, despite them actually being a normal size, i see them as huge and very womanly. I'm also afraid of my chest size. because of my recovery, I've gained more weight than before, which is fine, it's ok, i don't really care about weight but I care about things like my chest size and legs. i looks for advice but since there are not many articles or people sharing their experiences with ed's who are trans men, i never find the help I need. instead, i find things that trigger me more like people saying ""you should eat! you'll get a bigger butt and bigger b**bs!"" which is exactly what I DON'T want. but because of my increased dysphoria, my dysmorphia has been off the rocks lately. now, I'm not just self-conscious of my legs and chest, but my face and stomach. these thoughts saying i should work out and stop eating keep me up at night and takes my focus off of my work. it's driving me insane since I've been doing so well for such a long time and I don't want to relapse and lie to myself saying that ""I'm not hurting"" or ""just a little diet."" i want to not have bigger legs so i want to work out and eat less and healthier but i know for a fact that it will only make these thoughts louder. i want to go on walks just for my overall mental health but I know that I will most likely think about how I should make this another 30 minutes longer so I can work out a little more. it's driving me insane and i don't know what to do. i just don't know what to do. if anyone has any advice i would greatly appreciate.

1032,1032,eating_disorders,"I don’t know how the hell I managed to do this so quickly but after about a week of fasting with small window &amp; eating one meal a day while restricting calories to below my TDEE... I have freaking ruined food. And myself! 

I love cooking, there’s so much great cooks chowing off their recipes in my Reddit feed and I can’t enjoy it anymore. I see the oil, bread, pasta, whatever (typical fear foods) and have to keep scrolling. I get nauseous looking at it now. Matter of fact I get nauseous every meal now.

I have been lifting as heavy as I can for the past year or more and today was a lift day. My lifts were terrible since I started restricting again because I have no energy and recovery is harder. All this is obvious so last night I let myself eat a little more in hopes of getting more protein to help me today. When you’re lifting you want to have 1g of protein per lb you weigh essentially to promote muscle growth. I have been falling short on protein. Today I make sure to get a good amount in each meal (I had more than one!) and each time feeling full got me so sick. 

Breakfast was relatively small but I wanted fuel for my lifts. Lunch was a double scoop of protein mix to help with recovery. Dinner was meat and veggie stir fry and I couldn’t finish it.

I thought about this dinner since last night, I was so excited to try to recreate the Panda Express super greens as a side! My husband lifted today so it would be a great meal for both of us to hit our goals.... but I couldn’t finish it!! Calories were no problem! I could have had seconds and still be within my goals. BUT the feeling of being full was grossing me out.

I had issues as a teen but I am 31 years old now. I have no idea why but something clicked about 2 weeks ago and I’ve been slowly cutting back on what I eat without being hungry at all... just more tired and less motivated to work out.

I want to be healthy! I have been working at being healthy the last 3 years! My labs are amazing! I’m a little over weight but my doctors never brought it up as a concern. I know exactly what I need to do to stay on a good path but I am addicted to seeing the scale going down. It hasn’t gone down in so long.

The worst part is besides this I am the happiest I’ve been I think... ever! My marriage is amazing right now, which means more to me than most of the other stuff. Work is shut down because of covid but I think I’m okay with it. Family is... fine because my side of the family is on the other side of the country. I always used my ED as a way to control my fucked up home life but now my home life is good and suddenly I’m broken again.

I don’t really know how to end this I just needed to vent. Boy to I miss livejournal for just this type of anonymous venting. 

I hope I didn’t trigger anyone because it was hard to explain what I’m feeling and going through without numbers. I’m sorry if I gave too many details.

1039,1039,eating_disorders,"So I’m not even sure if it’s really an eating disorder or binge eating but I’ve started to notice a pattern. Always been a bigger girl (not huge but I’ve never felt or been skinny by any means). I keep trying to get healthier because I can see myself gaining weight and I just want to be a healthier person in general. Like many people I try to lose weight, it doesn’t last and I start eating again. What is starting to worry me is there seems to be some kind of trigger. When I try to lose weight I no longer try to restrict myself, I eat what I want in moderation. I don’t weigh myself daily anymore but I’ve noticed I’ll do really well, I’ll be enjoying myself and feel so much better then as soon as I see I’ve made any real progress I completely regress. 
For example, for 6 weeks I was doing really well. Gym 3 or 4 times a week (and I loved it) and was eating what I want but on a much healthier scale (smaller portions, not buying silly things I didn’t really want like big bars of chocolate). Then I saw that I had made it down to a weight that I would describe as “the bottom of my yo-yo”, like I can never make it below that weight because I start eating badly again. As soon as I saw that weight I was so proud and happy that I had done that and didn’t even feel like I was on some strict diet. Then for the next two weeks I completely regressed, stopped exercising, got really sad and stayed at home, started eating and eating (4 or 5 meals plus snacks, whole bars of chocolate and tubs of Pringles in one sitting). And I can’t understand it. When I’m not eating well or anything I don’t even eat that badly. It’s like seeing myself make progress triggers me to go the complete opposite way to reverse the progress. 
I’m sorry I’ve been rambling, I’ve just never spoken to anyone about it. 
What I’m looking for is if anyone has seen this kinda thing or experienced it before themselves.

1048,1048,eating_disorders,"TW// Mentions suicide and binging and purging

*I just want to preface this by saying that I am currently seeking out help for my eating disorder. I have been struggling with bulimia for 10 years and only just started speaking to a therapist this year. She is not educated in eating disorders, but we are in the process of seeking out a specialist who can help me get on the road to recovery. Please don’t tell me to discontinue my eating disorder behaviours, as sadly that is not possible right now.*

In May 2020, I had a severe bulimia relapse. I went from binging and purging once a week max, to binging and purging 1-3 times a day. I know this is horrible, but unfortunately it has been the only way I could cope since surviving a suicide attempt this summer. I do see a therapist once a week but am still struggling with daily suicidal thoughts, and my eating disorder is the only thing that eases the pain temporarily. 

I noticed my hair starting to fall out in July, but didn’t think much of it. I have always had extremely thick hair ever since I was a child so I wasn’t too worried. As the months went on, the hair loss became extreme. In the past 6 months, I have lost about 3/4 of my hair thickness. I take Centrum women’s multivitamins and biotin daily, but nothing seems to stop the shedding. I have also been using the same shampoo and conditioner for years now which has never caused hair loss. My hair is constantly shedding while dry especially if I touch it, and every time I wash my hair it comes out in huge clumps. Any time I comb my hair, huge chunks of hair get stuck to the wide tooth comb. The garbage can is just full of hair at all times.

Please, if anyone has any suggestions on supplements or vitamins I can take to help stop my hair loss, I would be so grateful. It’s getting to the point where I’m worried I’m going to have to buy a wig soon. My hair has always been the one and only thing I liked about my appearance, so having it all quite literally go down the drain in a matter of months is making me hate myself even more than I did before.

1049,1049,eating_disorders,"It will be 20 years for me dealing this frustrating, awful, exhausting disease (bullemia). 
I can't look in the mirror and not cry, not be disgusted and angry at the way I look. I am type 1 diabetic and that does not help. My endocrinologist won't prescribe an insulin pump until i know longer have an eating disorder.
I know what I'm doing is dangerous, I know I could choke, potentially ruining my teeth, making my metabolism worse and yet the feeling after purging is almost like the rush I got when I used a super addictive upper  just so to loose weight for 5 months of my life before going to treatment. 
They said they would try and help with my EA but their main focus was the drug addiction. I went to treatment and moved to a new city. If I had gone back to my hometown i probably would have gone back to using as I knew where to get it, that one person would get it no questions asked. I had never touched hard drugs in my 34 years of life and was able to get my hands on it through someone who I thought cared for me. 
Rehab kept me away but I'm not over my addiction, I think about it every day of my life, not only from the weight loss but because I'm chasing the feelings that came along with it. It escalated quickly, and was doing what I have wanted for so long. I knew it was dangerous but started to become more comfortable in my body. 
I am 5ft 6 and haven't stepped on a scale for 20 years. My only goal is to be comfortable in body. I'm not when I look at myself. 
I watched a beautiful Instagram post by lizzo a few days ago, and was so proud of her and happy how comfortable she is in her beautiful body, as soon as look at myself I'm sad and disgusted. I would be so upset if anyone I knew suffered from this and want to help them but I feel so alone. 
I went to the 10 weeks pre inpatient program at a hospital here and was told my eating disorder needed to be more under control, that I needed to break some of the symptoms on my own before being accepted...how is this possible? If I could break my habits on my own I wouldn't need treatment. 
I had my first ever suicidal thought a few months ago. It terrified me and still does. I shared that with my doctor who wrote a letter to the mental health inpatient program here.
They called and said we can't take you because you refuse to take anti-depressants (because of my eating disorder) she said I needed to fix my eating disorder and then they could help.
 It's a viscous circle and I don't know what to do. I don't have benefits for a private rehab. I can't fix my eating disorder on my own and won't receive treatment for it and my mental health until I do. 
My partner and I have been together for 6 years. I can't have children until I beat this disorder. It breaks my heart.  I'm not 100% sure if I want kids but it's not even  an option at this point. 
My apologies for the rant. But if anyone here in Canada has any suggestions I would be so happy to hear. 
My sister and I had a huge talk tonight both of us in tears. She was googling ea support groups and found one locally on zoom that offers 6 appointments for support with ea. She said she would pay the $ 30.00 ( i can afford it) but she said she wanted to help me. This was the first time anyone in my immediate family has ever brought my ea up with me. My parents are uncomfortable and don't know what to say and I feel like they feel guilty even though it's not their fault at all. They are amazing people. But hearing my sister say was one of the most great feelings I've had about helping my ea from someone other the  myself.

1060,1060,eating_disorders,"I'm not formally diagnosed with an eating disorder. I have spoken to my psychiatrist and to a therapist about it, but I have so much other shit to deal with that I guess it got lost. I'm not here to look for a diagnosis, but maybe some sort of reality check that I'm potentially harming my daughter. She's almost 2 and will be referred to as DD. 

I gained 88 lbs when I was pregnant and lost 63 lbs since. I'm so unhappy with how much I weigh, I go days barely eating. Yesterday, I made it through the entire day with only 2 scallops in my system (thanks mom-in-law!). I smoked some weed after putting DD down for the night and managed to eat a little more. I haven't been sleeping well and obviously haven't had any energy. But this is basically what all my days look like. I'll eat a tiny thing during the day and then stuff my face thanks to munchies. 

When DD is in daycare, she eats super well. I'll have some dinner with her at night (sometimes its my only meal, sometimes if I've eaten during the day, I'll skip dinner).

DD has been home for a couple weeks thanks to my cities covid restrictions. I noticed She's been eating a lot less. Less snacks, less at meals. I never eat breakfast, she used to eat so well but now she barely eats half of it. She used to snack like crazy, and ask for snacks, but now I have to offer or she doesn't eat. 

Is this my doing? Is she not eating because she hardly sees me eating? I'm not comfortable being stoned around my daughter, so I only ever smoke when she's asleep for the night. How can I change my shitty habits? At least around my daughter. 

My family is completely mentally unstable, so I'm trying to break the generational cycle (alcoholism, drug abuse, long history of anxiety and depression, borderline personality disorder and probably a few others that have gone undiagnosed thanks to my own shitty parents avoiding all their problems instead of trying to get help).

I guess when she was younger she was heavier and she’s been thin since high school she’s 28 now. She is not skinny to a dangerous point at all. If you saw her in public you wouldn’t think she has an ED at all.
I had kind of started realizing she had an ED because she would constantly talk about how “fat” she was and I was so confused because she’s clearly not fat at all. She has an obsession with working out and is constantly counting her calories and weighing her food.
She went on this diet where she was only eating 300 calories a day and I told her that it sounded really unhealthy. She was a personal trainer for a little while and she told me that it was fine. I started realizing just how much she is constantly analyzing her body and complaining about how she looks, mix that together with the scary diets and I realized she had some kind of ED (in my opinion, I’m not a professional).

I kinda talked to her about it and she was like “oh yeah I for sure have an eating disorder”. Fast forward about 6 months to right now, and she told me she’s still only eating 300 calories a day and she feels so guilty if she eats more than that. She said she began purging again, which apparently she hasn’t done in years. She also said she gets light headed when standing up. She works out from home every day. Cardio, leg and butt workouts, etc.

Now again I know very little about this stuff so I apologize if I use the wrong terminology or get things incorrect, that’s why I’m here. The thing about her is that she doesn’t want to be super thin like a lot of the people suffering I’ve read about. She just has these obsessions with hitting these goal weights, idk it’s really hard to explain. 

Like she still wants to have a nice butt and muscle somewhat but also wants to continue to lose weight. I just don’t know how to help her. She feels comfortable telling me about it because I never judge her or tell her she needs immediate help, etc. she kinda told her boyfriend about it but he just says stuff like “omg you need to eat more! Order a burger!” Like he doesn’t get what’s really happening in her mind.

She thinks her eating disorder stems from a long history of childhood issues. Parents, being overweight at some point, sexual assault, etc. She’s also been trying to be an actress for years and has been in some movies and productions (she’s a great actress) but I feel like that adds to the pressure to be “attractive”. I think because her job is so hard she enjoys having control over her body if that makes sense.

1065,1065,eating_disorders,"Hi all, this is my first post here.

I had been overweight for most of my childhood, and when I turned 15, I decided to stick to a plant based diet in order to lose weight. I ended up losing 50 pounds in less than a year, and I began to slip into a cycle of disordered eating. I would refuse to eat anything “unclean” and soon, I became very underweight. It caused a lot of issues with my family and eventually I was hospitalized for three days when I had an EKG reading that ended up being dangerously low.

In the following years, I would try working out in order to improve my self image, but I would still try to undereat in order to control my weight. I have never become “overweight” again since my initial weight loss in my teens, but it’s a constant fear of mine. I never stopped thinking about food and calories and numbers and the like. It basically is a part of my life now that will likely remain with me forever. It also continuously strained my relationship with my now ex boyfriend, who was constantly worried about me getting sick again.

We are now broken up (for unrelated reasons) and now I am with my current boyfriend whom I have been with for 3.5 years. We have a great relationship and we live together. These past three years, I have been doing okay with just living and not worrying as much about food. I’ve been suffering from other issues, mainly high anxiety and alcohol abuse, but I thought that I might be free from my past of distorted eating.

I am now 23 years old, and I just started a new medication about a month and a half ago for my anxiety which has been severely impacting my life. Sure enough, it just so happens that this medication has zapped my appetite completely and as a result I’ve lost some weight. I am 5’5” and now I weigh 110 lbs, which has been severely triggering me. I like being this thin. And now I would like to be thinner. And with this medication, it seems like it would be easy to just keep losing weight since I don’t even want to eat. It’s very scary how happy I am about this.

At Christmas, my parents made a comment about my weight loss and they seemed a bit worried. My boyfriend also asked if this weight loss was intentional or not. I don’t want to worry him in any way, but I am worried myself, you know? My past relationship was constantly filled with anxiety about my eating disorder and that’s not a place I want to go back to.

hi so i've been struggling with an eating for months. i don't want to self diagnose and say i have an eating disorder but i think i might have one. i told someone about it on reddit and discord (both places that were meant to have EDs talked about) and they both told me that i might have an ED specifically anorexia nervosa i'm pretty sure. 

from the time that i've told the chats about my eating problems it's gotten a bit better but worse at the same time. 

i've started eating more but once it hits night time i regret it so much and have suicidal thoughts. i say to myself that i'll starve myself the next day but always end up eating a meal or two and i hate it. i also started becoming a bit obsessed with calories. 

if anyone has any advice on how to stop this please please please tell me. i don't want to live the rest of my life like this. i'm still young i'm just 14 and i don't want to go on like this. 

before anyone even says it, i cant talk to anyone. i only live with my mother and wouldn't bring me

My relationship with food is so fucked up. :( 
there are only specific people i can eat in front of. and even that is complicated... which i won’t even get into. 

so honestly as a hard and fast rule: do not eat in front of others 

but....i work 12hr shifts. I get a 30min break, but i’m often too anxious to actually get and consume a proper meal for a multitude of reasons. again... complicated (bc i straight up do not even cook meals for myself to bring to work the next day!!!)

that being said, every day i am given 2 options:

1. Starve. let my demons eat me. 

2. Eat in front of others. 

tbh, 1 is my default, but I realize i must face my demons and eat in front of others. 

so i do. but i’m worried because i can only eat food that is “safe” which in my case is yogurt, crackers, and fruit cups. 

On the days where I have the confidence to eat, i do so, hours after the fact i am literally kept awake at night thinking about how disgusting it was of me to eat.

I ate the entire 15oz container of mandarin oranges—the label indicates 3.5 servings. 

Tomorrow’s;
I ate the entire sleeve of crackers when the serving size is only 5 crackers.

1091,1091,eating_disorders,"For context, it all started just before quarantine. I (F16) started restricting what I eat and I learned about calorie counting. Stupid me started eating 900 cal per day which is obviously way too little for me, even though it's not as low as some people go. I was extremely obsessed with food. When I went to sleep I thought about what I would eat in the morning, I would even try to count the calories for the next day in my head. In school I was always tired, hungry and cold and I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would spend way too much time at the grocery store comparing labels to get the most low calorie option. I would weight every gram of food I ate. And of course during the quarantine I had alot of free time and I would exercise for 2h per day, sometimes even more. All that went on for about 3 months, I lost some weight and ended up losing my period. I started binging uncontrollably and got my period back. I would find myself in the kitchen, binging on sweets. I started buying large amounts of sweets, for example a bag of cookies, a chocolate bar and a bag of candy and I would eat all of it at once. I would always think to myself ""this is my last binge, I'm getting back on track tomorrow"". But every day I would just wake up and have an extreme need to binge. I binged every day, stopped working out and gained more weight than I had lost. During summer I kind of got back on track, started working out again and tried to eat healthier . 

But now I just don't know what to do. It feels like I can't just eat normally. I don't restrict and I don't binge as much as I did before, but it happens sometimes. I overeat almost every day and even the smallest restriction triggers me. I'm addicted to sweets and I need to have some everyday. I am of course worried for my looks because like any teenager I am abit insecure with my body but I am even more worried about my health. I can't imagine all the damage I did to my health with the restrict/binge cycle and with the large amount of sweets I eat every day. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from restricting what I eat. I wish I could eat like normal people do, in normal portions. 

I've only talked about this with one friend but not in too much detail.

1092,1092,eating_disorders,"As much as i hate to admit it, i think instagram models/celebs have played a big part in my eating disorder. My eating disorder strated with the thrive that i wanted to look like them since i was 16. Now i'm 20, i just got out of the clinic and beat anorexia her ass. I've gained 15 kilo's and i'm looking healthy again. 

However the last couple of weeks my eating disorder is giving me a hard time. I''ve been thinking a lot that i'm fat and thinking about how skinny (underweight!) i used to be. 

In my recovery i started noticing some things i couldnt notice by myself in my ED.  I could not eat around guys (i'm female btw). I remember my exact thoughts, spending a whole date with a man and being so hungry but i would simply just not eat cause i thought my belly would get bigger if i would, crazy! I've made big moves in my recovery. I think about 4 weeks ago me and a guy  that i was interested in ate a bag of chips together, this was so huge for me!

I'm seriously interested in another guy right now and i guess we could get quite serious. My feelings are real. I have not told him about my eating disorder. He follows a lot of IG models on instagram, or simply just girls that he maybe has been with in person with INSANE bodies that follow him back. Instagram models make me sad cause i will never be like them and if that is what he likes, why should i bother? it really triggers me into wanting to lose weight again so that i can be like them.

I am aware that these thoughts are ridicilous and i should work on them 100%. But i was wondering, is it okay to ask ur significant other to unfollow models? For me its just so triggering, my ED was based of insecurities and comparing and it doesnt really help me.

I'm not dating him but im just thinking about my future like would it okay for me to ask a man (and tell him about my ED) to unfollow? or am i being ridicilous? I feel like i am lowkey. But i was wondering if anyone with an ed has experience with and how it impacts you and how do you maybe talk to your partner about it?

I don't know how this happened. It started as a simple diet to get rid of the 5 lb gained from studying for the MCAT exam over the summer.

I started by cutting out carb-rich foods. Then I cut out dairy. Then salty or fatty or oily foods. Then I started cutting my calories down to 500 calories/day. Then I started purging if I ate more than once a day.

The weight came off. I lost the 5 lb, then 10 lb, then 15 lb. But it doesn't matter. I can't stop.

The worst part is that now when I try to eat something, I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't enjoy the foods which I used to love anymore. I used to love daal, pasta, dosa, ramen, grilled cheese sandwhiches, etc. I even wrote a 3 page paper for English class in high school about daal, my most favorite food.

But today, I couldn't even finish an avocado.

1100,1100,eating_disorders,"Hey everyone,
So I suffered from anorexia about a year ago, I got into recovery or should I say I started binge eating which my “Health at every size” dietitian started justifying. Basically telling me to throw away my scale and eat whatever I want as long as I pay attention to my body.

I did that and gained a whopping 100+ lbs. I developed insulin resistance, knee pain, and my blood pressure skyrocketed.
I had a bmi of 36. And my doctor who was aware of my ED suggested safe and slow weight loss. 

I started losing weight about a month ago and bought a new scale. I stopped buying junk food and began eating more fruits and veggies.

But whenever I finish my meals or snacks, I feel hungry about two hours after (especially at night) and I deny myself food. It makes me feel like I’m relapsing. I’m scared. It’s hard to talk to my therapist about this. She believes I need to lose weight safely, but I don’t even know how.

I’ve seen three dietitians in the past. One was the health at every size who encouraged me to binge. SMH. The other one wanted me to put on 20 pounds in one month which terrified me, another believed I was just “fat and making excuses”.

Tbh my issue with food is making me suicidal. I don’t know what to do anymore. Idk if I’m dieting or relapsing.

my depression was pretty bad id say. i had no energy to do anything, i wasnt eating properly, i didnt feel any joy. and about 3 weeks in my depression, i decided to weigh myself because i havent been eating so much so maybe i would lose weight because i was trying to lose weight about months before but didnt work. and once i stepped onto the scale, i lost about 3 kg. and that gave me a spark of joy. the first feeling i felt in weeks. and i jsut wanted to feel that again so i started to starve myself. my mom noticed it and there were times she cried while asking me to eat. i was so mad because i just wanted to lose weight. at that time i dont think i was still thinking about school. i was just thinking about my weight.

I started keeping a calorie count on my phone (I must’ve been 53-55kg?)

Then I developed depression and stopped running. I kept restricting my portions, but I would have moments of binging on snacks. I would feel so guilty when I did, and tried to purge it but failed miserably (I have a phobia of vomiting/nausea)

I am now 18, I’ve done modelling here and there, I’m 5ft 8 (173cm) and 128lbs (58kg). I’ve been comparing my body in pictures with other models and I’m starting to feel desperate to lose weight to look like them. I’m more aware of my thighs when they brush against each other as I walk, the struggle to zip my skirt up, the way my stomach and back bulges when I wear jeans and a crop top. I hate how my chest sticks out and how wide my torso looks. I’m constantly staring at other girls’ stomachs, their figure and how their body doesn’t bulge in their clothes.

I started my calorie count on my phone again, and I’ve started abusing my Ritalin medication to kill my appetite. I know how wrong this is, and how this could spiral out of control, but I don’t want treatment. I am becoming miserable with my shape, I am desperate to lose weight.

1113,1113,eating_disorders,"I (20F) have been suffering from an undiagnosed ED since I was 13  y/o, which I now realise is a long time. I've never received any kind of  treatment. A while ago I looked for affordable recovery resources, but  my country offers none. Right now I'm not in a bad place, emotionally,  but I've been worse. 

Since the pandemic started and I've been having online uni classes,  I've had this huge problem. I'm neglecting school responsibilities  because of my ED. 

When I had to go to school, I could devote my time to attend classes  and study in the library, being somewhere else surrounded by other  people. Worrying about school meant less time I spent worrying about my  ED. Now I spend 24/7 in my home, I don't have anything separating my  free time from my school time, and I spend all day thinking about what  I've eaten, what I shouldn't eat tomorrow, how much exercise I should be  doing later, etc. It takes so much of my energy and time, I wish I  could turn it off and actually do some schoolwork. It's hell. The worse  thing for me is that I can't bother with studying since I'm so worried  about other things. I am an academically inclined person, I believe my  worth depends on my academic achievements. I know it isn't healthy, but  that's just how I've seen myself since I can remember. 

Since last week I'm not attending the zoom lectures, I'm not  studying, I'm not even working on group projects that I usually would be  doing (they involve other people and I have a responsibility to them).  What makes matters worse is that I have ADD and I've never really learnt  how to deal with it, so having online classes is already difficult  because I have trouble organizing my time.

So at my lightest weight I was exercising 2-2.5 hrs total a day, 6/7 days a week. Idk how I did it looking back at it now, esp cause I was eating 1200 cals or less. 

But I’ve gained my weight back after spraining my ankle and eating more. I’m no longer losing my hair or my period, and I’ve been struggling with binge eating, but it’s getting better and I’m trying to control myself. The thing is, my 13lb weight gain upsets me. I feel so fat, and I really want to get back to my lightest weight. 

Here’s the important part: I am obsessed with exercise. Funnily enough I hate it, but I like doing it at the same time. I get upset and feel guilty if I don’t do any exercise on “rest days” so I try to walk every day or do a leg/arm workout.

I do a 30 min HIIT, 10 min Jumping jacks, leg workouts, every other day and lift weights every other day. Is it too much? How can I stop being so obsessed with exercise?

This made me very unhappy and the more I looked at myself I could see how fat I really was. So I decided to start weighing myself. I weighed about 128 pounds which to me didn’t seem like much until I started researching: I found out that most 10 year old females weigh about 70-90lbs this shocked me and made me sad. The more I looked around I could tell how much bigger I was than everyone else. But I didn’t let it bother me and I tried to focus on myself until I turned 11. I’ve been weighing myself everyday I can’t stop, I weigh 144lbs and I lost 10 pounds in less than 2 weeks. I now weigh 130 pounds but it’s still too much. I want to be skinnier but nothing works. I count my calories and eat under 1200 calls a day. There’s been weeks where I binge and purge by working out for hours. I’ve been noticing my habits and been realizing I want to fix this- but also I don’t want help and need to get skinnier.  I notice how skinny my older sister is compared to me and how little she eats which makes me upset. I also get upset if I gain 1 pound and get put in a furious mood. I do see a therapist but that’s for my anxiety and I haven’t talked about my eating habits to anyone but my sister.

1132,1132,eating_disorders,"Hi,
My ex girlfriend and I dated for 4 months and she dumped me about a month ago because she has struggled with body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) in the past and our relationship was causing her to relapse. She didn't tell me anything about her body dysmorphia or eating disorder(s) until she broke up with me and when she told me she didnt tell me the severity or type she struggles with, she also told me I'm the first person she's ever told bar her family I presume. She told me she never lost feelings for me but she can't be in a relationship right now and as she can only see me romantically she doesn't want to see or talk to me at all. We didnt have an unhealthy relationship at all and would talk about things thoroughly if either of us were upset over something but I can see how she must have found it stressful as she felt she couldnt talk about her body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) with me. I see her commenting on pictures of her on Instagram saying she looks fat and also changing one of her online names to even include ""big"" and ""fat"" in it. I'm really worried about her but reluctant to reach out to her as she made it clear to me she doesn't want that. If anyone can advise me or give me insight to what she's going through it would be greatly appreciated.

This is the first time I have actually shared my story with anyone other than some close friends and my partner, so I'm sorry if it sounds rambly-

It started back in 9th grade when I joined the dance team with my sister. I didn't have my own car yet and my mom was in charge of taking me to school. Part way through the year as I was working out for 3 hours a day (long practices and only Sundays off) my mom started saying things like ""you are eating right?... Make sure to eat until you are full..."" And she would start before school taking me to McDonald's for their breakfast, and packing extra pizza in my lunch. (She worked part time at a pizza place and got to take home leftovers which were always our lunch). 

For dinners, sometimes my dad would cook, but it was mostly cycling between the next fast food place. And the drinks we always had stocked in the house were sodas.... Nothing else. At this time I was healthy and mostly muscle.

Then at the end of the dance year during one of our last performances, I did the splits and felt a pop. I didn't strech good enough before the dance and tore a ligiment in my inner thigh. I couldn't dance or swim (the other sport I loved) competitively any more.... But the diet remained the same.

By 11th grade I was overweight. This is when my mom decided that maybe it was no longer good for me to have pizza for lunch and said I need to go on atkins because I was so big. So my diet then consisted of a protein bar in the morning, a shake at lunch (I would walk to my car and park a block away so none of my classmates could see me drink it) and then dinner was still.... Well mostly fast food. 

As you can guess it didn't work. I graduated at extremely overweight As time kept going I moved out and tried to loose weight, sometimes I did but it never stuck. What always stuck was I hated my body. 

When I was 20 my mom decided we should do ideal protein together. I agreed because I was sick of feeling so big and unhealthy. And for a while it really worked! But it turns out that diet wrecked my body. Even though I lost weight I was the unhealiest I have ever been.

Now I am 25. I have thrown out the scale and tried to focus on eating healthy, doing some workouts and trying to stay active, but its hard. I'm grown now and need to be responsible for my own health and not blame my health now on my mother... But still looking in the mirror sometimes I hate it. At night I'll lie in bed after my partner is asleep and scratch and squeeze my belly really hard. 

Most days im fine, but today for some reason (it snowed alot and we haven't gone on our jogs and I have been under the weather so I don't workout) it hit hard. I took a shower this morning and was sobbing when I looked down. 

I don't know why that childhood keeps creeping up.... I thought I dealt with it. So why am I still struggling?

TL:DR- young childhood eating disorder has been creeping back up, but I really don't want to be mad at my mom anymore because I'm grown now

1145,1145,eating_disorders,"TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of weight numbers and ed. 

Hi, I'm writing this because a few minutes ago I purged for the first time. I started going to this new school in fifth grade and at the beginning of the year I was very skinny. I was 11yo and around 80 pounds. A lot of people noticed how small I was and would always compliment me on the way that my body looked saying things like ""Wow how are you so skinny"", ""How are you able to eat whatever you want and not gain weight"", ""Your arms look so small"". At the time, I was healthy, I was just naturally small. Obviously because of all the attention on the way I looked, I started to become self-conscious about the way I looked and wanted to stay skinny because all the attention and compliments made me feel good about myself. I refuse to let myself gain any weight because that meant that people would no longer notice me and give me attention. I know it sounds like at the time I was an attention freak, but I couldn't help myself. I started working out everyday and watching what I ate because I wanted to stay small since everyone liked me that way. Summer started, which meant that I had nothing but time to focus on the way that I looked, I started working out even more than I did before and really being mindful of the things that I consumed. I thought that I was becoming smaller, but in reality I was getting bigger. Towards the end of summer, I realized that I had gained a lot of weight and I was so scared to go back to school since I was starting middle school and I would now be surrounded by 6th,7th, and 8th graders.

I was now 12 and 105 pounds. I didn't look like I was 105 pounds, but I was, and that was something that made me cry for hours. I was still small, it was just the fact that the scale said 105 and that number tortured me for months. 6th grade was fine, I got principle honor roll all semesters and student of the year. People didn't talk about the way I looked in a bad way, all the negativity coming towards me was from myself. Telling myself that I was fat and worthless. 

Fast forward, I'm in 7th grade and I'm 13. Last month I weighed 112 pounds now I weigh 104. I'm doing school online because of Covid-19, but that doesn't stop me from thinking that everyone thinks I'm fat. I've stopped eating regularly and I limit myself to 600 calories a day. I've lost weight, but I feel that I still look the same and that's why I can't stop. I want to lose weight even faster than I am right now. That's why a few minutes ago I threw up the dinner that I ate. I've never done that before and I honestly scared myself during the process. I'm hurting emotionally and physically, but I'm too scared to get help because my biggest fear is gaining weight and being 112 again. I'm in my room crying, wishing that I could be that happy, skinny, 11yo girl again. The one that loved hanging out with her friends and having a good relationship with food, but she is long gone and is nothing more than an old memory. I hate myself for the person that I've become, I'm not able to focus on the important things in my life like grades and chores because I'm too focused on what I'm going to eat next and how I can eat less calories than I did the day before.",,My ED story at 13,17,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,jhj76a,1,StephanieWright00,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/jhj76a/my_ed_story_at_13/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/jhj76a/my_ed_story_at_13/,1603582429,623,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments and compliments about weight, fear of gaining weight and losing attention, self-consciousness about body image",harmful,"Developed an eating disorder and body dysmorphia, Restricting calories and purging meals, Physical and emotional harm, Difficulty focusing on important things in life","Receiving compliments on her weight and body shape, becoming self-conscious about her weight and body shape, fear of gaining weight",harmful,"Developed a negative mindset towards her body and self-worth, Restricting food intake and limiting herself to 600 calories a day, Purging after meals to lose weight quickly, Feeling emotionally and physically hurt, Difficulty focusing on important aspects of her life","Negative comments and compliments on weight, fear of gaining weight, limiting calorie intake, purging",harmful,"Developed a negative body image and became self-conscious about weight, Started limiting calorie intake and purging after gaining weight, Experiencing emotional and physical pain, Difficulty focusing on important things in life due to preoccupation with food and weight"

When I was in quarantine I ate alot of food because I was bored and I didn't exercise at all in 1 and a half months. I soon had stretch marks and I was really self conscious so I was determined to loose weight.

I started off being almost 80kg. At first I ate healthily and I excercied everyday. But I decided to take it another step further by eating less and less food everyday to the point I felt stressed to eat food and felt comforted not eating at all. 

Then I became sick and lost more weight than I should have. Only having a small bowl of porridge, and apple, a kiwi fruit and 2 strawberries a day at some point. Since then my mental health has gotten worse and worse.

I ended up being 59kg when I first went into hospital. They thought I was doing good so they let me go and I lost more weight. Now I'm in hospital again and I just feel like if I eat food it's going to make me fat since they put me on a meal plan and I'm sitting in bed all day.

1149,1149,eating_disorders,Hello everyone. I have been struggling with anorexia and disordered eating and I sometimes abuse laxatives after a binge to try to compensate and get all the binge calories out of my system as soon as possible. I realize this is dangerous and unhealthy and I really want to stop because I think all the misuse has caused me to get constipated whenever I do not take them. I actually have to take Miralax every day because it was prescribed to me by my doctor for previous chronic constipation and my prescription is 8g/day as per my doctors recommendation. When I abuse the laxatives I will typically take 68g Miralax and 32mg Senna (the recommended dose is 8mg and the Senna was not prescribed to me) after a binge. I only take the Senokot after a binge and I will gradually taper down the Miralax in the days following a binge until my next binge happens and the cycle restarts again. I realize this is way too high of a laxative dosage and that is why I want to stop misusing as soon as possible.

1154,1154,eating_disorders,"So, things moved fast with this woman and me, we moved in quickly together, she got pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure I know what I've gotten myself into here. She was very honest about her eating disorder from the beginning; I'm a therapist and found it refreshing how open she was in general. I was super supportive before dating, trying to look up vegetarian recipes, offering to cook with her, for her.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who went through a low-key eating disorder himself and still do (mainly in that I still ate tiny lunches and large diners) I sometimes struggle with good-foods/bad foods, diet culture, etc. It was very difficult stomaching to eating out every single night but I did, because it was how she could eat/pick at food.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been supportive in joining her with her nutritionist, once or twice her eating disorder therapist. I was joining her for this online support for eating disorders. The thing is, she doesn't really talk to her eating disorder therapist about personal stuff, she doesn't trust therapists after a very close one crossed boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

She's a vegetarian and extremely picky about what to eat. She doesn't eat mixed vegetables, fruits, salads, etc. She seems inflexible in planning out meals, eating left overs from the fridge. I've offered to look through the cookbooks she has with her and find things, but she says that sounds unappealing, especially while pregnant (She wasn't very keen on that before pregnancy).

&amp;#x200B;

As for eating out, before she became pregnant that was becoming difficult too. She doesn't like Chinese foods, health places, food that's too greasy, fast foods, Mediterranean  unless it's very authentic. It's basically Italian that's left after the criteria is done. She started becoming very fatigued with eating the same things at the same places, and then that became huge barriers in the relationship. I'm talking about literally spending HOURS about where she can eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she's pregnant and eating out isn't a thing. We stocked the thing with pizzas, Mac n cheese, Avocado toast stuff, some sliders I make, rice, soups, ramen. She won't eat a lot of repeats. I'll start getting anxious and list foods at her, because honestly, I can't figure what to feed her. I'll look through the fridge and pantry wracking my brain on what she could eat.  Just last week we spent hours on a single night because I couldn't think of what to feed her. She's often not sure what she can eat/tolerate/craves. If she doesn't know what she wants how am I supposed to know?

&amp;#x200B;

She's also gotten so stuck on food, she'll get delirious and then I've been left to feed her while she's in and out of it. That's happened about...6ish times since we've dated. Feeding her with a fork, lifting her head to feed her water/vitamin water with a straw. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's supposed to eat every 3 hours. It's been left to me to remind her/try everything to have her eat, according to the nutritionist and OB. When I haven't, she see's it as uncaring about the child, to her, low effort. As of now, I'm logging what she's eating the past few days because her nutritionist wanted something to help her figure things out in what she's eating. The girlfriend has felt too uncomfortable in the past to log food in, which I understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting extremely fed up having to feed another god damn human being that isn't my child. I've NEVER had to decide what someone has to eat this hard. It's usually a quick collaborate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm willing to eat anything with her and be supportive. But I'm becoming SO SO exhausted spending time on this. I'm not sure if I'm even being an enabler. She becomes angry when I ""throw my hands up and give up"" on trying to help her figure out food to eat.

1160,1160,eating_disorders,"Hello. This may be long but I am wanting to include as much information as possible. I am unsure how much information regarding calories or specific weights is allowed here. 

I am sixteen and male.  I believe I may have developed an eating disorder and may be struggling with anorexia.  I am technically underweight and I have lost a large amount of weight in the past six months or so.  I cannot give specific numbers on here because that seems to be prohibited in the rules.  I say technically underweight because I still believe I am fat even though I am in the underweight category for my age.

I am trying to lose weight by restricting my calorie intake and exercising because I am wanting to be even more thin.  I am obsessed with counting calories and macronutrients on a spreadsheet on my phone for everything I am eating.  I will become very upset and panic whenever I ate something that I consider to be unacceptable or not healthy enough.  Sometimes I will also overuse laxatives or start fasting for several days to try to compensate for whatever I ate that I considered to be not healthy enough.  I have heard about orthorexia as well and I believe this may apply to me also. 

Neither of my parents and none of my family or friends know about this.  No one has ever confronted me about having an eating disorder before.

I am not usually eating much and on restricting days I usually have one or two small meals each day and a protein shake.  I also do fasts for two or three days in a row sometimes.  I make sure to stay under my calorie intake goals for each day to continue weight loss.  I was hardly hungry at all today and I had one protein shake today and nothing else.  I had been fasting for the previous two days and I realize this is unhealthy and maybe anorexic.

I am writing this here because I believe I may have a problem and I am wanting to get advice or perspective from someone who is more familiar with eating disorders or someone who has gone through anorexia themselves.

1162,1162,eating_disorders,"This is not to discourage anyone from seeking treatment, but i’m just curious as to whether or not anybody else has experienced this. When I went to residential for the first time in 2017 my eating patterns had been restrictive for a long time but I was not counting calories, I was far less anxious about knowing the exact nutritional content in everything I ate, and my BMI was well within the healthy range for someone my height. I definitely had issues with food but my eating disorder was not nearly as serious as most of the other clients I was with.

In treatment I picked up new behaviors and anxieties about food just from talking about it with the other clients 24/7 for weeks at a time. Plus, I felt like I needed to “retaliate” against my body for the weight I had put on in treatment. I relapsed even more severely, actually reaching an underweight BMI this time, and was sent to residential again for 4 months. This time the weight gain was even more dramatic since I started at a lower weight and again I picked up even more behaviors. 

It’s been about a year since I was released from residential and 6 months since I completed PHP and IOP, where I never technically “completed” but was transferred to another mental health program not focused on ED because my treatment team reached a stalemate with me and didn’t know how to help me further. 

I now have no insurance since I’m out of school and don’t anticipate being able to afford insurance anytime soon so I cannot go back to therapy or a treatment for the indefinite future. However, my ED is worse than it’s ever been. I am CONSTANTLY anxious about food and never not obsessing about the components of everything I eat, I strictly count calories, if I’m able to maintain a healthy weight it’s only for a few weeks at a time and it’s only a few pounds within my healthy BMI range, I measure out my portions and at restaurants I choose my meals primarily based on calorie count, but tbh eating out and not knowing the exact components of all the food gives me so much anxiety now I just generally avoid it. I also picked up an exercise regiment that probably isn’t healthy and take my weight/measurements multiple times a day. 

I was nowhere near this obsessive and destructive when I started ED treatment and a lot of the behaviors I do now are things I probably wouldn’t have arrived at on my own, but learned from spending so much time in treatment with people more sick than I was at the time.

1164,1164,eating_disorders,"I've struggled with restriction in the past but no one really noticed. I'm generally pretty lanky but I gain weight in my center (stomach,back,boobs) and I think thats why when I started losing weight no one noticed or they complimented me. It was a subtle enough change to their eyes that make clothes lay on me better, but I was eating like 200 calories a day.  Only I noticed because I could feel my waist significantly getting smaller and my hip bones started to peek through which are things you can't see behind baggy sweaters. 

Anyway, regardless of not seeking real help I was able to kick the habit or so I thought. The thoughts always circled my head but recently it's been getting hard to ignore them again. I like the feeling of being in control of my life because usually it feels like life just happens to me and I have no say in any of it. 

I like being able to feel my body physically hungry and yet convince myself that I do not have an appetite and fully believe it. It makes me feel alive-  almost like a reminder that im not a robot and my body can actually feel things. Sometimes I feel like when I try to be positive and tell myself that no one judges me off of my appearance that I'm just lying to myself to feel better- like im avoiding a true bitter reality 
and I've never liked to be ignorant even if it is really bliss. 

I start hating people when they put me in positions to eat like my parents making me sit down for dinner or my friends wanting to go out to eat. And I love the feeling of controlling my body and making it look more like it did when I was younger and happier. I felt more confident back then, I was more in control, and something changed.

1165,1165,eating_disorders,"I (F18) am at my first year at uni and I have struggled with my self esteem for a long time regarding my weight, but I feel like it’s gotten so much worse lately. 
I have counted calories since sophomore year of high school and lost a little bit of weight (12lbs or so) and even though I purged once in awhile I consider it a healthy weight loss.

Now, however, I’ve begun to feel really guilty about eating. I started out just being strict about not going over my calorie limit (1,350ish) which made me feel good, but it’s escalating. For the last week or so I’ve eaten much less than the calorie counter app allows (600-800), and I’ve begun jogging as well. I’ve noticed that my pants are a little looser now, but I don’t have a scale in my flat so I can’t determine how much weight I would’ve actually lost? I limit my purging to like three times a week because I don’t want to mess up my throat, and I don’t binge, so it’s definitely not bulimia?

Basically I restrict caloric intake, purge infrequently, and I chew/spit ALL the time when I’m feeling snacky. But idk if it even really counts as an ED because I’m not underweight and I’ve not talked to anyone about it? I think I’m losing weight but without the scale I can’t determine how much. I am a perfectly healthy weight (138lbs a couple weeks ago when I left home, idk now, 5’7) slender even, but I still can’t seem to shake the guilt of eating and the desire to lose weight. 

At what point should I seek help for this? Does this even count?

1167,1167,eating_disorders,"Been struggling with an eating disorder for a while now. It has messed up my life. I am currently working with an ED dietitian and a psychiatrist. My therapist ditched me if u wanna read that story, it’s on r/depression. 

I have rapidly gained and lost a significant amount of weight. I cry about my weight and even beat myself up for it (quite literally).

I absolutely abhor being weighed at the doctors office. I have even requested to not be weighed but they tell me they can’t do that. 

Today, I was very much tempted to look at the “post-visit paper” my doctor gave me and I was filled up with a lot of negative emotions. It was overwhelming to see how much weight I had gained. I cried over it. I self-loathed. 

My doctor even suggested that I’m might get diabetes and I have to work out more. (She knows i have an ED).

After having this breakdown, i messaged my ED dietician. We haven’t been in contact for a while because I moved out of the county. She hasn’t replied to me yet and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

I never had bulimia but I’m having urges to purge. It might be silly, but I get suicidal over my weight. I am diagnosed with depression and OCD as well which makes life much harder. I also have very low self esteem and been struggling with my weight since I was 4. 
I even missed two months of school last year because of my crippling mental health.

I’ve been trying to get set up with a new therapist but because of COVID my resources have been very limited and the clinic is still figuring out my case.

I just need someone to be there for me. I barely have any friends since I immigrated to the U.S. about two years ago. I live with a single mom who’s always at work. Life is just too much.

1177,1177,eating_disorders,"Hi there. 

Every single day I force myself to eat and manage to have about 2 meals. Def an improvement to a few months back. But still.. i hate this life so much. I am constantly thinking about food and calories and my horrific body and my weight and food and food and eating and ... i feel so incredibly helpless and have some physical pain, too. Doctors are dismissing me, even my therapist (who knows about my problems with food) seems to brush it off. I think she doesn't see the problem, told me i need to set goals if i'd wanted to change this and stick to them. That was it. And I have tried, oh lord. I bought this book ''8 Keys to Recovery from an Eating Disorder'' and am working with it- when i feel some hope. I unfollowed so many people on social media and instead followed body positive bloggers and ed recovered people who give very good tips. I try every day to fix this myself but i just CAN'T- it's a cage. I don't have the key, i just don't even know if it exists. 

Will it ever stop? I sit on the floor crying my eyes out after eating, every damn time and the getting up part is just getting too much, it's pointless. Why do i get up when i'm back on the floor a few hours later? what's the point? i don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, it's just lost. i feel like as if this battle is lost- before it has even really begun. And more and more i grow confident with the idea of giving up, for i don't see a point to live in this hell, day to day.

1179,1179,eating_disorders,"I’ve struggled with body image since I was little. When I was 11 (21 now). I told my doctor I was afraid to eat, but exercising made me feel a little better about it. At 12 I was “underweight” and not eating. Everyone I ate I felt sick. My parents told me that I needed to “stop” because people were noticing, but did nothing about it. For years I struggled. Then I didn’t, or that’s what I thought, but I felt confident with my body. Looking back my eating was still pretty disordered: I wouldn’t eat and then id eat an tire box of cereal or a box of goldfish or other snacks. 

 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that is notorious for weight gain. Before, I had been “scale free” for about 10 years. I didn’t believe in them. A few weeks ago when I was feeling bad I bought one. I got on the scale and saw that I was 156lbs. 30lbs heavier and with BMI of 26/27. I’m 5 foot 4. but the scale also told me that my body fat % was pretty low, so I was confused. But I still felt disgusted with myself regardless. It’s hard to look in the mirror, hard to shower cause I can’t stand to see myself naked. I feel like a whale (though I don’t at all think other people who are heavier are ugly/or not worthy or anything like that). But I feel ugly and unworthy. I dread classes on zoom cause I can’t stand to see my fat neck. So I tried eating less. Did nothing. Tried eating less, stoped taking my full dose of meds, and walking 8 miles a day, obsessed with tracking everything on my Apple Watch: nothing. So I took to Instagram and found some wonderful accounts that helped people who were struggling. But I still don’t feel worthy of help: I’m not skinny, I try not to eat but then I do and I hate myself for it. The accounts were helping (finding exercise that I actually enjoyed instead of ones that I did for “punishment,” eat what you want to accept food and recover, etc. but now I had to coke hole because of my bipolar and my mom keeps talking about my weight no matter how often I ask her to stop. I told her I was struggling with eating, and that i was in recovery. She laughed and said I didn’t have an eating disorder. She keeps telling me I SHOULD be very aware of portions and how she’ll get me “back on track” weight wise. But that type of talk is so so damaging to me. It puts me back in a bad place.

So the only two people I’ve been comfortable enough to talk about my food issues with, their reaction are as follows

1) my grandma: promised she’d tell me if I was (direct quote)”chunking up again” (I used to be pretty overweight as a child, I can’t even look at those pictures now) and gave me weight loss advice as well as telling me walking was the best exercise 

2) my best friend: told me that instead of counting calories I should just make sure I only eat very healthy food (basically trade anorexia for orthorexia)

And yet I still feel like I’m faking for attention, despite barely telling anyone and desperatly trying to hide it from my family 

I don’t know what response I was really hoping for, maybe just some support? But I didn’t really get that so....
And yet my brain wants to be validated by hearing people say their worried about me, that I seem sick, that kind of thing, yet when my friend told me she is worried and she just wants bw to be healthy and happy and not malnourished like I freak out

Around September 12, I was weighted for a physical exam and it was around 67 kilos, my height was around 5""5 and that only means my BMI is not ok. I felt so sad.

September 17, I started going to the gym. I took all the courage

After 3 weeks, my weight went down to 63 kilos and yet I still see myself as a fat person.

I even used laxative a lot
I over exercised that I can feel the soreness of my body for couple of days
I eat so less that I count every calories as a sin if it entered my body
I even gave up rice for more than 3 months.
Whenever I eat regular meals, I try to vomit it all and make sure I wont let it stay in my stomach for 20 minutes. I never realized how purging affected me. I never felt accomplished even I am losing weight.

I became so unhealthy. So unhealthy that my anemia got even worst.
I loss weight so fast yet I still see myself as a fat person. I hated it. Whenever I see myself in the mirror, I couldn't help but to cry a lot and starve myself.

No one knows.
I was in denial that I am suffering with an eating disorder. My depression makes it more difficult. I intend to compare myself a lot with other girls. I became so self concious up to the point I will isolate myself so much.

They keep on saying things like, ""Palitan mo na uniform mo, sobrang luwag na talaga"", ""Bumaba na yung palda mo dahil pumayat ka talaga"", I kept on ignoring them. My goal is to have a weight of 56 kls and I will keep on doing my unhealthy routine.

During my internship, I have no choice but to eat rice because there are no other choices. Little did my co-interns know, after I eat rice, I purge after we eat. I keep on thinking that eating rice is a sin. I even got to worried because my internship affected my gym schedule.

1194,1194,eating_disorders,"**Please read &amp; share ur thoughts/opinions**, i feel that only people who struggle(d) with eating disorders can give me advice that might help me.

My 8-year journey of multiple eating disorders:

i became anorexic in grade 9 (2012) which lasted 4 years - i was about 5'6 and 85lbs at my lowest weight. i received out-patient care &amp; therapy, then became orthorexic once i started eating again. I was orthorexic for 3 years when i started university (2018) - i literally ate 0% plain greek yogurt, salad, and chicken with veg every day i lived away from home because i had the freedom to do so and i fet healthy and in control and i LOVED it when people would tell me how skinny and ""healthy"" i was. i felt traumatized when friends would invite me over for baked brownies and a movie, and it got to the point of me trying to fit in with them and eating junk. but i began throwing up after eating the junk because of how guilty i felt about eating unhealthy foods. at this point i was still thin and my body wasnt gaining weight because i did not excessively binge on shit.

then quarantine happened, i moved back home, and did a complete 180. too many triggering foods were available to me and i developed excessive binge eating habits on anything i knew was easy to throw up (it was never anything healthy fyi), followed by purging. it got so bad that i was probably eating over 5000 calories a day... and praying to god tht i purged enough to not gain any weight. Eventually i noticed that i was in fact gaining weight but i kept telling myself ""i will stop tomorrow"" - but i quickly became addicted to it because it was my only sense of purpose while living in my parents home alone all day doing nothing and seeing nobody (note: i would never have the guts to see my university friends right now because i really DO NOT want them to see how much noticeable weight ive gained, esp. when i was once known as the ""skinny friend"" - well, actually the *skinniest*).

now, 7 months into binge-purge bulimia, i have gained about 20 lbs (110lbs to 130lbs). my parents know everything about all my eating disorders, and ive become so manipulative along the way that im very good at hiding unhealthy behaviors from them. i have so many moments that i regret and hate myself for.  i hate looking in the mirror, i hate seeing cellulite i never had before. the worst part is when i compare how good i looked when i was orthorexic (note: i was actually healthy from a physical/medical point during this time) to how disgusting i feel that i look now. and i KNOW that i did this to myself by having unhealthy overeating and purging habits. i used to feel healthy and in-control and beautiful, now i feel fat and totally out of control.

ive managed to not binge/purge for 3 days now, but i have only been able to do it by restricting my calories, only eating 2 meals a day, avoiding snacks, and only eating low-fat low-carb meals. i do feel more in control about my habits but im not noticing changes in my body. i still see a fat pig in the mirror because i struggle with body dysmorphia.

can anyone else relate to this? is it bad that i have a hidden desire to reintroduce my anorexic/orthorexic tendencies??

1195,1195,eating_disorders,"Hello everyone,

I really didn't know where to start to reach out for help. I think I am suffering from Bulimia.

Some background: I am an 18 year old college student (F) and this is actually my first semester at my university. I was valedictorian of my class in high school , graduated with an 8 point something, and even earned a college degree from a local community college in my hometown. Coronavirus hit, so my senior class obviously did not get to enjoy prom, senior trips, or even graduation. I said my speech over a youtube video. I understood it was for the greater good, but I think I was seriously getting depressed.

Now I'm all moved in to my dream school and I thought things would finally start to look up. However all my classes are online, I can barely meet/see any of my friends due to social distancing, and I'm really really homesick and lonely a lot of the time.

I got a 60 something on 2 exams last week. After studying my ass off, pulling all nighters, skipping showers, doing anything I can to understand the material for these difficult classes. I desperately want to have a 4.0. My dream is to someday go to med school. I just don't know what I 'm doing wrong. I'm using every possible resource my classes provide as well as external tutoring services. I have always been a good student and I don't know what's wrong with me. I put my all into school and I am getting nothing in return at this point. It may seem like I'm overreacting, but this is so extremely important to me.

On top of all this, I have always struggled with my body image. I don't like the way I look or feel in my body. But I have no time to go to the gym because I'm studying. So I skip meals and purge instead.

I haven't really been binging yet, but as my body slowly runs out of fuel, I can see that happening to me too. Sometime I eat something small, like a salad, just so that my stomach will shut up and I can refocus on school. But ultimately it just gets thrown up.

**It's not new for me to throw up when I'm stressed, but it's never been this bad before. I threw up blood this morning. Sometimes I throw up so much to the point where all that comes out is my stomach acid. The sides of my mouth are cut and bleeding from shoving my fingers so deep down. My uvula is always sore and cut up.**

All I do is drink coffee and water, just because I need it to keep me awake (to study more).

I hate feeling this way. I've partially told my boyfriend and sister, but definitely not to the full extent (as to not worry them). I have another exam this Wednesday, and I'm slowly losing my motivation to do well anymore. I can't hold any food down, my body feels frail, and I've lost about 10 pounds in a week. I'm happy I'm looking slimmer, but I know this isn't good for my health.

What do I do? I can't tell my parents. They would be extremely disappointed with me. My anxiety is at an all time high and I feel so so worthless. I don't consider taking my life, but I often feel lost and detached from myself.

Hi! 
I need to see if anyone can relate bc I honestly can’t talk to anyone else about it. I used to have a really hard time eating and I would always restrict and not eat until 4pm.

1206,1206,eating_disorders,"Hey all, im looking for some advice.

God I don't even know what to say.

After a severe life changing injury, alot of it was mentally destroying but physically too. I put on a lot of weight. I have Pcos too. At 5ft1 and my heaviest weight of 16st.  Over the last 6 years i had dropped to 14. Last year I attended grouo oain clinic sessions which taught me to unhook from my unhealthy comfort eating  / eat my feelings moments.
That was good, great. It started my weight loss. I wasn't snacking or binging food.
Then i got the flu which decimated my appetite, just as i was recovering from that, i got the norovirus and that put me off all foods.
I have always had some issues and I have neber enjoyed food. It was just there and comforting. But i never have enjoyed eating.
Since November i have lost over 3 stone. There is roughly ba stone and half to go. I don't have a set weight in mind, I just want to get to where I feel comfortable in my skin again.

But where i have no appetite I'm struggling to eat anything most days. I am having to force myself to eat which i 99% of the time i cant do.
Since Thursday all ive had to eat is 1/4 of a fillet if fish and  6 mouthfuls of dinner  the night after.

I don't ever really feel hungry or get any signs of hunger. I've tried a few different ways to encourage myself to eat. Smaller less daunting meals. Meals that can be picked at even when cold. (I'm a slow eater and this is currently the thing that works best as i can just pick as and when) in the last few weeks which granted have been very difficult emotionally and physically and I've been very stressed but this technique doesn't really help as much as it did. For a while I was using weed to help. I smoke it for pain relief as currently this is the onky pain relief i have that works.

I don't want to make myself unwell or unhealthy as I would like to be healthy to have a child when i find the right person. Im almost 30.

I don't know if i have an eating disorder or not. But i know if i keep going the way i am I will. I have been on and off wanting to ask but at 13, 12 stone i didn't think it was much of an issue now I'm down to 10.6st  i am approaching where I feel comfortable ish. Im getting there.

Finally, this year since my ed has gotten worse and worse alongside my overall mental health I tried to reach out for help, I've already gone to a center specialized with eating disorders, I have a therapist who just after a month and a half has sent me to the psychiatrist, yet no one has sent me to see a nutritionist.

1213,1213,eating_disorders,"hey! I've never talked to anyone about a possible eating disorder as I've been overweight most of my life and I just feel kinda stupid feeling like I might have an ED, and bringing it up so I thought I'd ask your guys's opinions😊 (I know you're not doctors, I'm just embarrassed to talk to them. I know you can't diagnose and I don't take your suggestions as diagnosis, but hopefully it'll provide me some insight)

In the last 2 years I've lost 85 lbs (215-126). I don't really restrict myself too bad or display typical eating disorder behavior, but I'm absolutely terrified of gaining weight 😅 the average weight for most of my life was 155lbs, and I felt so so horrible. My weight loss has also been a rollercoaster, I binge and hate myself then restrict and eventually lose it. I started out this year around 132lbs, went back to 147lbs in March, back down to 135 in July, and now at 126 (being 130 last 2ish weeks ago). I have more fat on my body than most people my weight which really bothers me, and no matter how much weight I lose its never enough. I have maybe 10 foods I let myself eat, everything else I've weeded out and try not to touch. Today I had 3 tacos, half a tortilla soup, half a bag of maltesers and half a bag of smarties. Yesterday I had 4 tacos, half a tortilla soup and half a bag of maltesers. The day before that I had half a bowl of ramen soup and a spicy mcchicken I think. And last week I hardly ate anything, I think I went a day without eating, and 2 or 3 days with eating one bowl of potatoes. Can't remember the rest. 
I don't exercise a whole lot but I try, today I walked a dog for 1 1/2 hours, and I was working at a school on my feet all day Monday and Tuesday. When I exercise more I let myself eat more. If I don't exercise much I'll let myself eat some potatoes and something else. 
I also spend most of my day smoking weed and cigarettes, which I hate. But if I'm craving food sometimes I just trade that for a smoke and I can push past it. 
I am obsessed with my weight though. I don't weigh myself as much as I used to, mostly out of fear to step on the scale. If I'm losing weight and feeling good I'll use it morning and night, and when I'm in mixed episodes I'll go all out and weigh myself before and after I use the bathroom and whatnot. If I'm gaining weight I generally don't use the scale unless I know I've gone too far and I need to know. But other than that I'm terrified to step on it so I tell myself it only takes one week to make a difference on the scale, next week you'll weigh yourself. I measure myself more, if I have something to measure myself with I try do it at least once if not twice daily. I'm constantly poking at my fat, or admiring the weight I've lost (if I'm feeling good about it) or squeezing my fat and wanting to cry in disgust with it all. I almost can't walk past a mirror without body checking. My worth is entirely tied to how I feel about my weight and I hate it. I've lost most of the muscle in my butt, it sags so bad. And my family is grossed out by how bony my elbows, chest and legs are 😅 (but my stomach still has so much fat!!) And my dad has said I don't look healthy 😅 (which can probably be contributed to the smoking)

1215,1215,eating_disorders,"21, f. I've had a problem with my body, food, dieting etc. since middle school, but I know I don't meet the criteria for any specific eating disorder. I'm not overweight or underweight, but I've had a big problem with emotional eating and binge eating pretty much since high school (with brief periods of restricting in between. Or very rapid cycles of binging/restricting etc. Tried purging even, but I could never manage it physically). My very first psychiatrist said the prozac would help me with the binges, which it did for a while but I'm on different medication now anyway.

I'm doing better in terms of body image now than when I did in high school, but the toxic relationship with food never left me. I haven't restricted in a long while but I'm still a big emotional eater and I feel like my physical health is taking a hit because of all the junk, too, my stomach is always in pain and actual meals make me nauseated nowadays (which I'm inclined to skip, anyway). But I don't know how I would go about seeking help because I know for a fact I don't have bulimia, anorexia or even BED. I mentioned the periods where I'd binge eat at once and then go days without eating to my therapist once but she didn't really pay attention to that or dig deeper, presumably because I no longer do that.

I am still really struggling but have been making a half hearted effort mainly because I dont want to make her worse and partly because I'm just tired of this life.

I’ve been steadily getting more obsessive since then. Now it’s September and I’ve realized I can get Away with eating way less and fasting longer.

I also body check like evey hour and i feel good knowing I’m eating less then everyone else, it’s weirdly comforting even though I dotn hate my body completely.

1232,1232,eating_disorders,"So in May this year I decided to start trying to lose weight as I was sick of always feeling so fat. I had seen a YouTube video about intermittent fasting so I decided to try that. At first it was going really well and then I plateaued and stopped losing weight. No matter what I did I was stuck at the same number. So I figured why not cut out lunch everyday and start counting calories. That ended up working and I was losing weight even faster so eventually I decided to cut out breakfast as well and restrict my daily calorie intake. At first it was 1000 calories a day then it went down to 800 then 700 and now I feel disgusting if I eat more than 500 a day. I’m still intermittent fasting so I will only eat for 3/4 hours a day. I start eating at about 5pm and finish around 8.30pm. I allow myself to drink a cup of tea once my fast has ended and then about an hour later I have dinner but I have to make sure I’m eating less than everyone else. I will usually have a small snack after dinner too and until recently I would have a cereal bar or a low calorie desert but now I only let myself eat fruit cos I feel too guilty. 
I thought I was being really healthy and didn’t think anything was wrong with this until I saw a TikTok where some girl said that when she was anorexic she was eating 1200 calories a day and that wasn’t even enough. I’m eating less than half of that. I still feel healthy though and fitnesspal says 1200 is healthy. Also I was talking to my friend about my diet a few weeks ago and she said that I’m starving myself but I feel absolutely fine. If I was starving myself surely I’d have some sort of health issues and I’m fine.
I am 18F 5”2. I started out at 145lbs and I’m now down to 120lbs but honestly I still don’t see a massive difference. I barely see a difference at all in my before and after pics. I still feel so fat. I really want to get down to 100lbs. Once I get down to 100lbs I’ll just start eating a bit more.

It started when i was about 10, i remember buying jeans in 5th grade which were a size 5. 
A size 5 is small yes, but for a 10 year old girl whose devolping quicker than the rest..i thought i was fat.
So from 10-12 i would ""diet."" 
Eat less and healthy, which i then began fasting..not knowing theb what that was.

My mom was in her mid 20s and my step dad had beat it into her head daily that she was an ugly cow.
All while i was standing close enough to hear the verbal abuse, it rubbed off on me. 
It rubbed off on her to the point of asking me how fat she looked, or just that statement alone ""God, i look so fat.."" 
I'm 13 now and mom is a size 0, and anorexic.
I'm a size 7, it's 2002 and i hate myself.
The summer goes on and on and she leaves my step dad, but the buliema comes with us.
We move and she's so frail.
I hear her forcing food from her stomach into the toilet from my room...
I find her diet tea and laxative and start getting ideas.
If she thinks she's fat, i must be repulsive.

I started my first year of high school at 155 lbs. I looked fine but felt gross in everything i wore, i felt ugly, i felt fat and uncomfortable all. The. Time.  
I was a size 11.
My body didnt look like the other girls..

Beyond my own family unknowingly making me feel this way, every girl in school, on the magazine's, television, myspace etc. We're bone jabbing thin, so thin you could play xylophone on their protruding ribs and i wanted that. It's all I wanted, all the time, and quickly grew into a 6 year obsession.

Now, remember the years here, 2003-2009 was the height of low rise jeans, hip bone tattoos, and the ""no thigh gap"" thing was a craze. 
I never had a thigh gap but at that time it's all i wanted. 
I yearned to be 90-100lbs but my body wasn't made for that.
I was never a thin girl but i was never over weight either. 
All bodies are beautiful, thin and small and inbetween but when i was young n nothing and no one could tell me different.
I was nothing but a number on a scale, and in my mind i felt guilty everytime i took a bite of food.  My whole existence was me obsessing over my weight and comparing me to them.
&amp;Every time I ate, went to the bathroom or made myself throw up- I got on the scale. Or exercise till i could hardly stand.

After every dinner, every snack, or any outing even with friends I would hit the toilet and purge all of the contents in my tummy.
After every school dance i was in the bathroom vomiting.
If i didnt do this, i felt gross

When summer came and i would ride my bike for hours, walked so much it hurt, and in the night id exercise non stop to burn off whatever was left in my stomach. 
I was obsessed with being thin. 
It was all I became.
I wanted to be someone else, but my body wouldn't allow it.
I wanted only water to be in my system, and i was looking up blogs with how to guides for binging and purging, fasting, and tips on starving yourself..

Junior year got out of control.
I had a boyfriend tell me i needed to ""suck the fat from my stomach."" 
I was 135lbs at this point. 
I got so into ""fitness"" i got a most improved award for dropping 20+lbs in personal fitness In gym class.
And altho my mother left my dad, she still had serious issues about how she viewed herself, and felt about herself for the things he had said to her for 10+years.
I don't blame my mom for any of this, nor my dad.
You know who put these ideas into their head?
Our society, the people on the news, magazines, fucking Barbie dolls. 
This was no ones fault but the brainwashing ways of the world.

I last made myself throw up when i was 20. 
I'm 31 now and i can't say I dont struggle with self love, but i have come so fucking far from the shell of a person i was growing up.
And it's been one of the hardest things i pulled out of in my life, but somehow I did it. 
No one even knew this shit about me until about 5 years ago, i was so ashamed and embarrassed.
But now things have changed, i have healed and i Keep seeing so many posts of girls and guys who currently struggle or have struggled with these types of things and it breaks my fucking heart.

I haven't been ""actively"" ED for probably close to ten years now, I'm in my late twenties. It shows. I'm skinny fat and my US/CAN dress size is pushing double digits. I live in Canada where lockdowns were pretty intense and I was out of work and so stressed out and overwhelmed and living on my own and it just clicked. Opting out of the grocery store shenanigans is the only way I will feel saner and cleaner.

I was right. I was so right. More right than I knew. I feel like I've come home. Things that didn't fit for years are baggy. My hair's kind of thin and my eyes are hollow, but, fuck it. For reference, I am not censoring but still trying to be mindful of where others are at, and prefer not to throw around numbers, but if you are concerned about my physical safety from the sounds of this, please rest assured my BMI is well within normal and you probably wouldn't assume I was up to anything if you had seen me for the first time. Not that any of this invalidates the danger inherent to these behaviours, I am just not at or even near ""medical intervention"" yet. I haven't posted here before so I wasn't sure if this was necessary to insert, but would rather err on the side of over-explaining given the subject matter than ""FUCK IT, WE'RE UNCENSORED, DEAL.""

My old(?) workplace, which put SO much pressure on me to perform and look perfect all the time, has screwed me over and left me hanging without work even though benefits have ended. I went to visit the other day because I look SO. GOD. DAMN. THIN. and I'm already tall and now my bone structure is popping and with the right concealer you can hardly see the purply eyes.

Everyone looked like shit, as expected, and the people that were the rudest to me before either ran and fucking hid with their leftover spaghetti, or were SO nice and fawning I was low-key wondering uh, is this the same person??

I'd forgotten how powerful even a low-key dramatic weight loss is, and going against the trend of a pandemic, when you are beautiful under the extra padding anyway. They can try to pretend like you're not and you're worthless across the board when you're chub but showing up unexpectedly skinny and lithe and running on empty. 

Oh God it hits so different.

1251,1251,eating_disorders,"I've struggled with my weight basically since I was 10. I gained a lot of weight rapidly in middle school, and my parents got on me about it. By the time I was 11 I was extremely overweight and my dad freaked out at the pediatricians. Kept saying how bad that is.  Seriously bad.  They start dragging me to run the park (I've never 'exercised' before, im fucking 11). And it was hard obviously. I hated it. I felt like i was dying. My dad pulled me aside and straight up told me i was fat, that i needed to workout and eat better. Otherwise, id have diabetes (like he does). He kept asking ""do you want to shove needles in your stomach every day? Do you want to die of a heart attack at 32?"" Yeah. I was 11. I was scared and confused.  Basically from then on, I never could not look at my weight. I developed depression, which spread to many other areas of my life (anxiety, social insecurities, obsession over my academics, etc). But my weight was the biggest trigger. 

I dont know if it was just me, but being 11-14 and being expected to go on a diet / exercise routine was.... not easy. I didnt know Jack shit about calories, nutrition, etc. I was constantly terrified of my body: I always wore long sleeve jackets, even in the summer, just so no one had to see my body. I kept outgrowing my school dress pants and skirt, but was too scared to ask my parents for another that would fit. 
The scale just kept going up.  I didn't know how to eat (and my family didnt make it easy. They just ate how we normally would, which made it harder for me to ""portion"" control off of that because again, I didn't know how to do that at 11 on my own). My family also made sure i was aware of my eating too, my mom making comments about how big of a slice of cake i was eating, just small things. I remember one time we went to a restaurant and I ordered a filet sandwich, ajd my dad said I could either eat the bun of the sandwich, or throw the bun away and have a milkshake as my ""carb"". I couldnt have both. It was tricky because I still liked food. 

Its always been very difficult for me to hold back on food. It didnt matter if I was stuffed: if something good came to mind, I was going to eat it.  And I literally just ate the entirety of things sometimes. I dont know why its so hard for me to stop and control myself. 

I remember my dad telling me he had a thyroid problem, and he was given medication. But the medication was tricky because if in the wrong dosage, could make you lose way too much weight. He said he dropped an unhealthy amount of weight in a short period of time ans had to stop taking the medication. And i remember hearing this when I was 13 and wanting so badly to have a thyroid issue JUST so I could be issued the medication. I was determined to take it, like a lot of it, because losing a ton of weight so quickly sounded like heaven.  I was so disappointed to never be diagnosed. 

I battled my weight up and down for years, counting calories, crying, forcing myself to workout. I would try extreme measures, like only eating 1/3 of what I normally did, but then pushing myself to burn 3x as much as I could in a day. I would crash and burn and binge and lose all my progress within a couple days. I didn't know anything about nutrition of course. 

I've spent years trying things. My parents tried a diet program which fell apart because it was hard trying to eat those while also going out to dinner with family or eating what they made me instead. I went to a weight trainer who helped me a lot in terms of how to workout effectively. I took weight training and nutrition classes all throughout high-school to learn more. But the overall fear ans consciousness of my weight fell on me every day. Id push myself at the gym for 2 hours every day until I couldn't manage it and would give up. 

I'm 20 now. My weight fluctuates 30 poinds every year for the past 6 years. I will fight myself and steadily gain weight between September and April (the school year) by repeated trials of going to the gym and then lapsing, counting every calorie and then binging, being stressed about my inability to keep on something or rather, still gaining weight despite my periods of trying. And then suddenly just start shedding the fat during the summer when i sit on my ass, sleep till noon, and do no physical activity except mow the lawn once a week. I once went to the gym 6 times a week for 2 weeks, and ate fairly well, and I thought maybe I cojld lose a pound or so, but I ended up gaining 2 pounds. I then tried to go 3 days without eating anything at all (and became depressed when I gave up at 62 hours and ate a PBJ ans chocolate milk ).

My parents also make it a reminder, especially during my ""heavy"" months of the year. Its bad enough when I'm already fighting myself internally over my weight and my eating on a daily basis, but because my parents only see ive gained weight, they take it as me not doing anything about it consciously. So my mom will buy a pair of jeans (and for whatever reason, probably ""hopes"" i lost weight and buys them a size smaller than what I am and have been for years) and these jeans obviously don't fit. Or a tight fitting shirt. And she will say 'its cute. But this would look absolutely stunning... if you just lost a couple of pounds."" Or during winter break (an obvious binge and guilt  period) my mom would see my eating and my body and say ""you have such a fantastic gym at your college! I'm honestly jealous.... promise me you'll go to the gym every single day when you get back to campus?""

I get they want whats best for me, but when I'm already internally stabbing myself with all these thoughts in my head already, hearing it from them too just makes it 10x harder. 

 I have always cried over the scale. Always cried when running out of breath on the treadmill. I cry when I look in the mirror or see a photo of myself. I hate my body and I hate myself. 

I finally live in an apartment this year where I can cook and live on my own. And I was doing REALLY good. Like really good: I've learned so much about nutrition and working out and finding a balance, of what I need and what I can cut. And how to splurge once in a while and treat myself. But I've also made a hqbit of weighing myself daily, tracking every calorie i take in, fretting when the scale goes up 0.5 pounds. Or being worried that i must have tracked wrong when the scale goes up. Its kind of hard to maintain this lifestyle, and I'm starting to plateau at this weight (which i still need to lose some). 

But when I come home during the weekends, and I'm surrounded by all the delicious and fattening foods that I don't allow myself to even buy at my apartment, i lose it. I just eat and snack and whatever, and I think lately it's been worse simply because I've been away from it too long. I'm not even hungry: I see a cake and eat it.  I eat cookie dough from the fridge. I had pancakes and cinnamon buttery loaf. We went to dinner and I was stuffed to the gills but still wanting to eat more ajd more of my potatoes, cake, and bread. 

The scale obviously increases a ton and i feel like I lose a month's progress in just 3 days. 


I started a new job (at a bakery / deli) and even saw my inability to control myself with food. If something is 1 day past expiration. We have to throw it away. But it's perfectly fine still and I end up trying to snack it or take it before it hits the trash. (I actually only started eating ""better because I had a fried cheesestick that was about to go to trash it was like 4 hours old. I had such a bad migraine the rest of my shift, barely made it home because I was swerving all over the highway in pain, feeling like I was passing out. I cake home and threw up. And the next day I just made something healthy and delicious and just stuck with it-- my parents were gone the whole week. So I could actually do shit for myself for once). 


I thought from that experience I would stop snacking at work but the urge is still there and I occasionally still do, despite how disgusting it truly is.

And when my parents came back from that week, and saw I was ""eating healthy"" it was such a big joke. My dad laughed and chuckled to himself when I made a veggie omelet and sliced fruit for breakfast. Kept saying ""let's see how long this will last"". Or we went grocery shopping and I put whole wheat pasta in the cart instead of our regular white pasta and my dad said ""oh my god, whole wheat?????? what is it with this healthy stuff all the sudden??"" (Like its pasta bruh. Seriously)

I get it. I've never been successful in making any long term change. So why should this be different? But its just. A little support would be nice. Just once. Just once. See I'm TRYING and congratulate me, and not make fun of me for it. 
 

But again, i just can't control my food intake. At  my apartment, if something sweet or fatty is available, ill eat it in a heartbeat. No control. Whether im hungry or not. Whether I just had a satisfying meal or not. Whether its 1am or 1pm. 

And at home, again, it's impossible. 

I don't know why I've always had such a hard time resisting food. I don't know if it was jus a coping mechanism for my depression or if there is some underlying eating discover (I don't like to self diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression but even that, my parents were skeptical of, so I am led to believe I shouldn't consider myself ""depressed""--which is a whole othee story of suicidal thoughts and self harm--paetislly due to my weight as well). 

I've never had the strength to talk about my weight or eating to anyone, though, so no one would even know to diagnose anything of that sort. 

So yeah. I dont know if struggling to control myself around food is normal. Or just being extremely overweight and subsequently, obsessing over my weight and my food is natural. 

I've read about eating disorders and learned about them in psychology class and I just assumed I definitely don't have one because I don't meet the severity of symptoms. Like I feel guilty after eating, and though I've considered trying to make myself throw up, I don't/cant. So I feel like that alone shows I just have lack of self control and not an eating disorder (although i genuinely wish i could make myself throw up. If I could do it regularly, i would).

For the past year or two many of my family members and friends have commented on how skinny I am or how they're concerned I don't eat enough (even though I've been gaining weight).
In the past I did have serious issues with calorie counting, food restricting, and maintaining strict exercise if I ever ate what I thought was too much. However, these issues were slowly being resolved as I knew the self-destructive behaviors would eventually lead to a dangerous place and was trying to stop them.
These last two years though, as I've been maintaining a healthy weight, my family members seemingly all of a sudden started voicing their concerns about me not eating enough. 
These comments reinforce my old mindset that all the things I did before worked well and recently I've relapsed a bit trying to maintain my ideal body image and in some twisted ways I want to feel validated by having them think I'm skinny. My mother and doctor have both asked if I eat enough and I don't want to worry them or have them monitor my food intake if they think what I eat isn't enough, but if they keep commenting on it I'm going to keep feeling shitty and fall into having a fear of eating and gaining weight again.

I (f18) have only been dating my boyfriend (m18) for a few months. he wanted to rush into things pretty quickly, and I let him because I liked him a lot. but i immediately realized that a few problems are coming up.

we both have dealt with very similar issues concerning our mental and physical health, such as self harm and eating disorders. personally, i’ve had issues with anorexia and mild bulimic habits over the years. he’s also dealt very heavily with bulimia, but i wasn’t made aware of this until recently.

now, this shouldn’t have had to be a problem. i had been “recovered” for a very long time. although i still struggled with that mindset, i never acted on anything and i was very proud of myself for it. however, about a month ago, my boyfriend made a joke about being bulimic and it was very triggering to me. so of course i brought it up to him, because why would i want to get triggered into going back to that low point, right? also, i just dislike that type of humor.

but it also turns out that it wasn’t a even a joke to begin with. he just flat out said something along the lines of, “well, i wouldn’t be so skinny if i wasn’t bulimic.” and proceeded to laugh like it was funny. it really put me in an off mood and we had a discussion about it. and i don’t know why, but ever since then i’ve found myself spiraling down into a relapse. it doesn’t help that he finds it appropriate to discuss his “struggle days” with me, even though he knows now that i struggle with the same problems (i.e, he tells me when he makes himself throw up, when he hasn’t eaten all day, etc). and i understand that he probably just wants support, but i feel like it’s taking a toll on my mental health and i’m not sure how to communicate to him that he can’t come to someone like *me* to hold him up when I can’t even fully take care of myself. he seems to lean on me quite a lot for emotional support and i’m not sure i can always provide it.

i really care about him a lot and only want the best for him. i just came here looking for any sort of advice anyone could give me regarding the situation since i feel really alone and as if i can’t talk to anyone about it. i also feel a lot of guilt and like maybe i’m a bad person for thinking all of these thoughts. so, could anyone lend a hand by offering up their opinion?",,ED Struggles in a Relationship,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,ihq21b,1,throwaway7748633672,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/ihq21b/ed_struggles_in_a_relationship/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/ihq21b/ed_struggles_in_a_relationship/,1598551503,453,0,0,0,-1,1,Boyfriend discussing his own eating disorder and making triggering comments,harmful,"The triggering comments and discussions about his own eating disorder have led the writer to spiral into a relapse of their own eating disorder, The writer feels guilty and unsure of how to communicate their boundaries with their boyfriend","Boyfriend discussing his bulimia and struggle days with the writer, making triggering jokes about bulimia",harmful,"Triggering the writer into a relapse of anorexia and bulimic habits, Putting a toll on the writer's mental health and emotional well-being",Partner discussing their own eating disorder and making triggering jokes,harmful,"Triggered a relapse in the writer despite being ""recovered"" for a long time, Feeling overwhelmed and unable to provide emotional support for their partner"

1273,1273,eating_disorders,"This is going to be very much about me, so sorry if the title seems misleading. 

It's a long post so tldr at the bottom. 

I'm 26/m and have only recently come to terms that I have anorexia. I've been getting therapy for separate reasons recently and have started to get help through the same therapist.

My entire life I've been the tall skinny guy. And I was always proud of that, people would always be telling me how jealous they were of how thin and light I was, and it's well sought out to be a tall male.
This made being the tall skinny guy my identity, if I wasn't the tall skinny guy, I wasn't me.

I'm 6ft2 and around last year managed to get over 10 stone(140lbs)  consistently for the first time in my life. It instantly filled me with dread realising I was slowing no longer becoming the tall skinny guy. It didn't help that my dad would always say 'just wait til your mid twenties, I was just like you then the weight catches up with you'.

To try and control my weight to be no more than 10 stone I started making excuses to skip meals. Suddenly I no longer had time to prepare and eat breakfast before work. This turned to during my lunch breaks I had other things I needed to make sure I got done,  I needed to arrange moving out of my girlfriends parents, I had a car that was breaking down(almost as often as I was!) that needed trips to the garage. The weight of adult responsibility was feeding my anorexia, allowing to to consume my life day by day.

More so recently, I realised to counteract the lack of food during the day with big unhealthy meals. Because I spent most of my day dealing with adult responsibilities, the last thing I wanted to do was prepare proper meals. I would just chuck a tray of chicken nuggets and chips in the oven, cover them in cheese and ketchup and call it a meal.
It tasted great, but left me conscious of my physique still.

For context, I have a super flat chest - literally skin and bones chest, but because of that it accentuates my stomach, making it look 'bulgey'.

Last year my girlfriend left me, for another man, and didn't hold back being open about it. The anxiety, depression and guilt (yes I blame myself for not being good enough for her) left knots in my stomach.
I literally was unable to eat, even when I was so hungry, I couldn't process the thought of putting food in my mouth and swallowing.

My Aunt suggested eating anything that I felt like eating as and when I got hungry, but that lead back to the one meal a day of chicken nuggets and chips, or fast food.

The past few months, I've been living off one meal a day, until maybe the last week or 2. I've been doing everything in my power to avoid eating.

I'll make excuses like, I'm too busy for breakfast, my doctors appointment in the morning over ran so I shouldn't take my lunch break, my flat mate doesn't feel like having the same meal as me so I won't prepare food. Even things like preparing food means having to wash up afterwards and I'm just too busy, and it's not fair to leave the washing up to my flat mate all the time. 

Last night I hit a whole new low when I kept wanting to eat, but a strange sense of pride held me back 'you've made it this far, you've nearly gone an entire day on just coffee'
I made it to bed last night and just felt so depressed that I wouldn't allow myself to eat - I started on a big bar of chocolate and after a few bites felt guilty, but was enjoying it so much. I made it through half the bar before the guilt became too much and I curled up into a ball of regret until I fell asleep.

So now with the long story out the way, the point I wanted to talk about.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm 26/m and feel ridiculous that I'm going through this, I understand its not my fault entirely. But at the same time I feel pathetic, you never hear about people over the age of 18 experience this, and if you do it's few and far between, let alone males experiencing it.
It makes me question the validity of what I'm going through, and what I can do to get past this.

1274,1274,eating_disorders,"i just discovered this subreddit &amp; i’ve been wanting to vent about my frustrations with food. my friends can sometimes be dismissive of it or give terrible advice. i’m not intentionally looking for advice in this post, but if anyone has a similar experience and has any insight i would be interested to know how you are doing!

i used food as comfort from as early as i can remember up until i moved out to college. i would emotionally eat as a child because i experienced trauma from my alcoholic mother &amp; dismissive father, and even after my mom got sober i still ate and ate and ate because i was severely depressed. when i was 18 i was approaching 270lbs and my self esteem was at an all time low. 
3 years ago i moved away from home to start getting my bachelor’s and i liked the independence that came with it. my parents would always buy groceries and it was often unhealthy, processed foods, but since i was living away from home, i was able to make better decisions with my food choices. at first it started out pretty well, with mainly home cooked stuff with normal portion sizes, and i could tell i was losing weight. my depression started to get better, too. it’s not completely gone, i still have my bad days, but i’m no longer hurting myself like i did in high school. 
but then i made a new friend who used a vape, and every now and again she would let me take a few hits from it. i just liked it because the taste was nice, but eventually i developed a nicotine addiction and now, two years later, i’m completely dependent on nicotine to function and i spend more money on pods than i do on groceries. we all know that nic can suppress a person’s appetite, and my weight is continuing to drop because of it. i also got diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and i’m prescribed to take 40mg of adderall per day. the combination of nic and adderall have completely destroyed my appetite, and more often than not i eat no more than a bowl of fruit or some yogurt. i’ve been vegetarian for about a year now so my only sources of protein are through legumes, lentils, and other things but i unfortunately do not eat a lot of those. 
i’ve noticed though that on days where i decide to not take my meds, usually because i have no plans/deadlines, i eat waaaay more than i am used to. the issue with that is that i do not even enjoy food anymore. i don’t know if i’ve ever actually, truly enjoyed food, though. as a kid i would stuff my face with as much food as possible, as quickly as possible, and i never really allowed myself to slow down and savor food. now, it feels like eating is a chore. the only time i eat quickly now is if the nic and adderall has worn off and i can feel how hungry my body is for food, but even then, i don’t enjoy eating. one time my friend and i took some thc-infused candy (we are both of age and in a recreational state) and got some late night munchies, and she made a comment about how i “inhaled” my food. i don’t think she meant anything harmful by it but it made me self conscious about my eating. i usually eat by myself because i don’t want anyone to notice how quickly i eat. 
i do not know how much i weigh now, and i refuse to buy a scale because i know i would become obsessive over it. i just know a general ballpark of where i’m at, and because of how tall i am, my BMI is around 30 which is considered obese. i know that BMI is not an accurate unit for assessing health but it still it doesn’t feel good to be classified as obese. i also often cant even recognize myself in pictures because i envision myself still as the 260+lb depressed 18 year old. 
i just want to be able to eat food, whether it be healthy or something indulgent, without hating myself for it or obsessing over the calories/macros of it. i went from being a human garbage disposal as a kid to becoming a ridiculously picky eater who prefers stimulants over sustenance. i feel like i will never be able to have a healthy relationship with food that doesn’t involve constantly telling myself not to go down a bad road again.
i cant even confide in my friends about my issues with food because they would not be able to believe that i have a dysfunctional eating pattern that’s going to hurt me in the long run. i am not thin by any means, i wear size 14-16 jeans and i usually have to go for large or extra large tops. my physical appearance doesn’t meet society’s expectation of a person with an eating disorder",,my relationship with food has always been terrible,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,iguekk,1,dubbleblended,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/iguekk/my_relationship_with_food_has_always_been_terrible/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/iguekk/my_relationship_with_food_has_always_been_terrible/,1598426507,847,0,0,0,-1,1,"Using food as comfort due to childhood trauma, developing a nicotine addiction, and taking Adderall for ADHD",harmful,"Experiencing a loss of appetite due to nicotine and Adderall, leading to weight loss, Feeling like eating is a chore and not enjoying food, Self-consciousness about eating habits and eating quickly, Difficulty confiding in friends about eating disorder","Using food as comfort due to childhood trauma, developing nicotine addiction, prescribed Adderall for ADHD",harmful,"Depression and self-esteem improved after moving out for college and making better food choices, Developed nicotine addiction which suppresses appetite and causes weight loss, Prescribed Adderall which also suppresses appetite and causes weight loss, Eating has become a chore and is not enjoyable, Self-conscious about eating quickly and eating in front of others","History of emotional eating due to trauma and depression, addiction to nicotine, ADHD medication (Adderall), vegetarian diet with limited protein options, negative self-image, lack of enjoyment in food, difficulty confiding in friends",harmful,"Continued drop in weight due to nicotine and Adderall suppressing appetite, Eating quickly and not enjoying food, Self-consciousness about eating around others, Struggle to have a healthy relationship with food and not obsess over calories/macros"

I'm hoping to get some advice regarding this problem.  
I'm sure I'm not the only person dealing with this.  
Achter 10 years of Anorexia binge/purge subtype and doing every ffed up thing possible I'm better now.  
I've been problem free for almost 3 years.  


However, I want to move on but apart from my Bf who's been there to help me along the way no one else from my friend group and family can.  
No matter what I do I get bombarded with questions, accusations and weird looks.  
My family sees me often enough to notice a difference in my behavior.  
Nothing is hidden.  
I used to hide in the bathroom for 1 hour to purge and go very eary or late.  
Often also because of L-pill abuse.  
I weighed so so little, but am very fit now.  
I even walked up multiple mountains (intermediate walks) every vacation.  
I don't have this grey lifeless skin.  
I eat, when they are there and don't disappear after.  
I've never cried again when looking in the mirror  
No food has disappeared and I'm saving a lot more money  
My blood checks are perfect  


Should I go on?  
Why don't they notice the difference and how happy I am?

1277,1277,eating_disorders,I don’t know if this needs a trigger warning or not but I’ll put one here just in case. TW ⚠️ So at the end of May I started trying to lose weight. I’ve always been really insecure about my weight so I decided it was finally time. I had heard about intermittent fasting and so wanted to try that out and also was trying to eat in a calorie deficit. It started out really healthy and then I started to restrict my calories a lot more. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with this until my friend told me that I was starving myself and I wasn’t eating enough. To be completely honest I still don’t see an issue. I’ve been eating about 500 calories a day for the past 3 months and I am completely fine. It’s also still taking me really long to lose weight. I do get quite scared to eat anything with over 200 calories and I always plan out what I’m gonna eat because I can only eat a certain amount a day but I still look and feel just as fat as before. According the the scales I have lost 20lbs but I don’t see it at all. Also I feel like that’s barely any weight loss in like 3 months. So many other people have lost a lot more in a shorter amount of time. So my question is is this disordered eating? Is there anything wrong with this? I feel fine so I don’t see the issue. I’m not gonna stop if it’s helping me lose weight but my friend just made me question myself a bit.,,Can someone help me?,14,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,ifn26i,1,anonymous27302,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/ifn26i/can_someone_help_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/ifn26i/can_someone_help_me/,1598267876,277,0,0,1,-1,1,Restricting calories and practicing intermittent fasting,harmful,"Eating only 500 calories a day for the past 3 months, Feeling scared to eat anything with over 200 calories, Not seeing significant weight loss despite the extreme restriction",Restricting calorie intake to 500 calories per day for 3 months,harmful,"Feeling scared to eat anything with over 200 calories, Feeling as fat as before despite losing 20lbs, Questioning whether this behavior is disordered eating",Restricting calories and practicing intermittent fasting,harmful,"Eating only 500 calories a day for the past three months, Feeling scared to eat anything with over 200 calories, Feeling fat despite losing 20lbs, Comparing weight loss progress to others and feeling inadequate"
1281,1281,eating_disorders,"I'm currently a 23 yr old female that has struggled with eating disorders from age 11 or 12. I discovered pro-ana sites and was fascinated by restricted eating. this mostly had to do with my abusive perfectionist mother who made fun of my natural pot belly and made me start working out at age 10. My father was also not in my life until age 10, where he developed his own eating disorder and was obsessed with ""clean eating"". sometimes I would starve with him.

by age 13 I think I was bulimic but not necessarily due to wanting to lose weight but I loved the feeling of purging. I did that every night in the shower and even when my parents discovered it they did nothing. I was still praised for losing weight.

by age 15 I moved to a new school and met a girl who was clearly up to no good. through her I discovered losing weight by using meth. I used until I was about 18, and was still bulimic.

at age 18 I stopped cold turkey. I've rarely made myself throw up since then and its only been due to being drunk or sickness. at this point I've lost about 50 or 60 pounds overall and I now hate how frail I look. It's obvious I've lost weight fast and unhealthy, and now my relationship with food sucks. I have to force myself to eat most of the time and I have developed severe gastritis from my eating patterns.

1283,1283,eating_disorders,"1. I had to eat tomatoes for breakfast (at noon today) because I could not mentally handle anything else and I would run the risk of passing out or becoming even more weak than I already feel and nauseous if I did not try to eat anything, which would prevent me from eating “normally” for the rest of the day sending me into day or week long cycles of starvation, exhaustion, and depression due to physical and mental fatigue. I am still trying to eat more tomatoes and it is now 1;30 pm.


2. I frequently cry before or during meals in order to relieve the overwhelming tension and anxiety I have about having to force myself to eat and to gain the confidence to eat at all 


3. I frequently take two hours or more to eat a “meal” that I do not even fully get through and it often takes me two hours or more to prepare that meal as well because I can’t sit still, or be around the food comfortably for an extended period of time. 


4. I am on a physical and emotional roller coaster hour to hour and minute to minute of the day because I do not know if I am okay or not (am I going to pass out, Will this make me throw up, whats wrong me with that I can’t eat this, I can hardly stand up, I feel like I’m forcing food down my throat and it’s not even going down) 


5. Mealtimes, restaurants are ruined for me and the people around me (mostly my boyfriend) because I have a total inability to feel comfortable eating in a “rushed” or “pressured” setting (I.e when meals are expected to only last a certain amount of time and the people around me openly enjoy it and clean their plates) It makes me jealous and miserable at the same time. 


6. There have been times where I binge eat to the point where my stomach feels like it’s going to explode. 


7. My relationship with food and eating is heavily tied to my moods (volatile daily), emotions, and well-being. 


8. I have lost and will continue to lose hundreds of dollars to food that I waste, or buy just for the pretense of looking like a normal person.


9. I fixate on certain foods and will obsess about eating that food as much as possible for a period of time (for example, two winters ago I was getting 32 Oz or sometimes 64 Oz of boiled peanuts a day for weeks on end and subsisting on them) 


10. I don’t like that my body looks like a weak child because I can’t take care of myself and I can no longer accept this version of myself and be okay with it anymore 


11. I sometimes use liquids or alcohol to try to fill the empty space in my stomach and body. 



This is my life daily and has been for many many years (around 7 or 8). I can no longer live like this as it is driving me into an even deeper and escalating depression and I am scared for my life, the quality of it, and my future, which at this time seems extremely bleak because all I can see is more of the same if I don’t ask for help.

At first everything was fine, I exercised a normal amount and ate healthy too. However, in the last couple months I've been in an endless cycle. I've gone crazy counting calories every day and sometimes I scare myself into eating less than a normal amount of calories a day. If I go over the threshold, I always increase my workouts just to burn it all away. The second part of the cycle is the binging. After a week or so I give in and just binge on whatever I can find. Usually I average to 3000 or so calories and I always feel guilty afterwards but once I start I just say ""F it the damage is already done"". Through this I've seen my weight fluctuate a lot. I reached my goal weight only to want more and continue restricting, and through binging I always gain the weight back and thus the cycle continues. I'm scared to tell my family.

when i was a teen, i hated my body and just stopped eating. i didnt know what was happening but it did, until I eventually managed to eat healthier and more balanced.

a few months back I learned how meat and dairy can be bad for you, so I stopped meat such as chicken and beef(?) and stopped dairy altogether, using alternatives. 

however, a few weeks ago, i started eating lots and making myself sick after. it got really addictive and i was doing this with every meal. soon after i was feeling bad about it and even though I was hungry, I’d chew food and spit it back out, rising my mouth out with water to make sure I didn’t swallow anything.

But recently money has been tight. I havent been drinking alcohol/smoking weed, I have been eating frugal meals, and biking instead of driving.


All my clothes are looser. I'm really upset. I feel panicked.


Immediately I fell back into that horrible mindset of obsessing over weight. I started thinking about dieting, planning my days around it, imagining myself at my ""ideal weight."" I started looking for a scale, was about to download a weight loss app, was ignoring hunger cues, etc. It's bad. It's real bad.


Part of me feels like I have achieved something that I need to protect with my life. Something I can lose at any second. I feel vulnerable. I am scared to put the weight back on, but I think eventually I'm going to. I'm trying to prep myself for that, but it is hard.


I also feel scared. I'm scared that I didnt lose the weight in a healthy way. I feel scared that I lost weight without control and intent. That's not how it has ever happened.


*TW* SA
I'm also scared because when I was at my smallest I went through SA. Being thin is a trigger. I gained a shit ton of weight after that happened. What would happen is I would eat and eat and think, ""I need to gain weight. I need to be invisible.""


I am swinging from both extremes right now. From ""I need to lose weight to be loved"" to ""I need to gain weight to be safe."" The latter is the one I see coming in from the distance. I don't want to go there again. I havent binged in so long.


Now nothing feels simple or safe. I went for a walk to clear my head, and all I could think was, ""Am I really doing this to clear my head? Or am I doing this to burn calories? Am I going back into my ED?""


I also feel bad because I know healthy people wont understand. My mom would say ""Isn't this what you want?! Stop complaining about the weight of your diamonds."" I feel guilty over my struggle with this.

I wanted to buy a sandwich today to make things easier, but the fucking menu had the calories on it. Ofc I picked the one with the fewest calories. Why do they do that? I just want food to be food, not a number.

1301,1301,eating_disorders,"This will be long. I just need to get it off my chest.

I've struggled with anorexia since I was five years old, when I first started restricting, throwing food away and lying about it, chew&amp;spit, etc. That was nearly 30 years ago. I spent most of my teens twenties with a BMI of about 16, sometimes lower. My wedding dress, a directly off the runway sample size, had to be taken in 3 times before my wedding. When I'm stressed, I starve, and well...I stress often. I've had 3 children, and not only could I not breastfeed any of them because my bodyfat was too low, I also lost bone mass with each pregnancy. So, sure, it's been a struggle. And every time I think I've found a balance, some semblance of contentment with myself, there's some trigger and I fall down the rabbit hole again.

I had my third child a year ago. In July, I weighed 140lbs, 10 more than my prepregnancy weight. That may sound like a large number for an anorectic, but I'm 5'11"", so 140 is a size 2 on me. I was more or less okay here. I felt fit, was working out every day, walking/hiking every day. Feeling pretty decent, and though I'll never love myself, I didn't entirely hate myself.

And then I caught the coronavirus. We've been so careful. I haven't seen anybody out of our household since February. I only go to the grocery store and for walks, and I obsessively wash and sanitize. Always have my mask on out of the house. Still managed to get it. Of course, I quarantined in the bedroom to try to keep my family from getting sick. Did not leave the room for over a week. Didn't play with my children, couldn't snuggle my baby, couldn't touch my husband. He brought anything I needed to the room and quickly left. I stayed in bed a lot, slept loads. No appetite. None. Funny enough, I never lost my sense of smell or taste. Just no desire for food. I ate once a day, because I knew I absolutely had to. A cup of soup and two pieces of toast. Every single day. For nine days. 

When I started to feel better and could leave the room, on a whim, I decided to look at the soup box my husband had been purchasing. 170 calories per serving. Plus toast. I estimated that I was getting about 500 calories a day while fighting a virus. Which is probably why I lost over 5lbs in a week...

I love it. I was so incredibly happy to see the number on the scale. And I thought, well I still don't feel great. I still don't feel like eating. Why not continue? That's exactly what I'm doing now. Ten more pounds. I've promised myself I'll stop at ten. In fact I'll only do five more and assess from there.

But let's be real. I'm lying. Because this always happens. There's always a reason, always an excuse, and I find myself willingly falling down the rabbit hole again. I will always be Alice.

I haven’t wanted to tell my family because they all struggle with body image and I didn’t want the questions, but everyone has noticed that I lost a lot of weight. I try not to weigh myself much, usually once every couple weeks since March and I’ve been losing on average about 5 pounds every two weeks. Last time I checked the scale, which was yesterday I was the same weight as two weeks ago. not only that, but this week I have been so unbelievably bloated and my stomach is impossible to suck in. I’ve been seriously spiraling because I feel like I’m being punished in someway. I basically gave up eating for the past five months just for my body to randomly betray me and start uncontrollably bloating Even when I’m doing everything the same.

1304,1304,eating_disorders,"Just posting this because I feel like I'm going crazy and wondering if anyone can relate. Quarantine has made my ED flare up. I'm super sad, which has left me with a decreased appetite, and then I restrict to try to make myself feel better (I guess my thought is, ""I may be sad and alone, but at least I can lose weight."") Obviously, it doesn't really help, but it is pretty comforting. It is also SOO easy to do so because I'm 1) alone and 2) home all day. My family doesn't eat together much, so it's pretty easy to restrict without anyone noticing, which is nice, but it also makes me feel a bit sad that I'm not spending enough time with anyone for them to notice the changes. 

I started cooking at the beginning of quarantine, and have continued to do so and enjoy it so much, but have gotten to the point where I can barely enjoy the meals I make (I cook for my whole family, and still enjoy the act of doing it, but really miss enjoying/wanting to eat the food.) My appetite has been really really poor lately which makes me feel sad and exhausted and kinda like I'm losing my mind. I barely want to eat anything, but I realized recently that I enjoy really basic foods that are high in sodium, so I got some top ramen, and eating that made me feel good and somewhat normal. I don't know why I'm writing this, I'm just so sad. I miss enjoying food, but I also feel that I don't deserve to eat it. 

I had one of my first meals with people outside of my family tonight and it was tough. When I served myself, I felt like my plate was full, and I knew that it was more food than I would want or normally eat, but when I looked around I realized I had so much less than everyone else. I had to pace my eating during the meal as to not finish way before anyone else. My friend's mom served everyone dessert, and not being able to pick my own portion obviously freaked me out. People joked about how little of it I ate, but I'm not really a sweets person, so I didn't feel too uncomfortable about it. I think the being alone aspect of all this is difficult. I've really come to feel like my behaviors and eating are normal because I'm just not around other people, but they're not. I am so sad, and lonely, and miss enjoying food, but I also feel that restricting is one of the few comforts I have right now. I'm not really looking for advice I just needed to vent.

1307,1307,eating_disorders,"Hi friends,

I have never posted on any type of internet forum before, but I am too scared to talk about this with family/friends/therapists/medical team members for fear of being sent back to treatment. I am an almost-30 year old medical provider myself, and I understand the importance in speaking with a medical professional and not going on the internet for medical advice- I condemn my patients for this on the reg. I am just hoping someone here has some medical understanding of how eating disorders affect the human body and can give me some advice anonymously, or perhaps lead me to someone who might be able to help. 

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa 1.5 years ago- spent 7 days in the hospital because I was bradycardic and then spent 3 months in treatment. At rest, my lowest HR during sleep was 35, and it was mostly in the 40s-50s during the day while I was up. No symptoms other than GI issues (which is what brought be to the doctor's office in the first place), no abnormal labs, BP was totally stable, no dysrhythmias. My eating disorder had developed over the course of 6 months (so not something I've been living with for long). In that time, I had started running 2-3 miles daily (never was a runner before), and was restricting calories to anywhere from 1,000-1,500 per day. Lost 40lbs over 6 months, and noticed very quickly into it that my resting HR was in the 30s/low 40s. It probably only took 1-2 months to develop this severity of bradycardia, and at that point I had only lost about 10lbs and was at a stable BMI. I thought it was so fascinating but (even as a medical provider myself) didn't see anything dangerous or wrong with it since I had no symptoms and felt great. I figured I was in the greatest shape of my life.  

Fast track to after treatment, I was fully weight restored, and HR was back to normal (resting in the 70s). As soon as I came out of treatment, I probably dropped 15lbs in 1-2 months. I've been stable at this weight now for over 1 year and actually feel like I have found a good balance. I am not underweight, I work out regularly but not obsessively, and I eat 3 meals/2 snacks a day (probably average 1,600-1,700 cal per day) which I DO understand is not enough, but I've been maintaining at this number for a while so I feel okay. From the outside, everything seems fine. 

But the truth is, I am bradycardic again- and have been for maybe 10 months. I am hiding my bradycardia from everyone. At rest, I am usually in the low 40s, sometimes the high 30s. When I am moving around during the day (not exercising), I am in the 50s-70s. Absolutely no symptoms. Everything else is normal. 

I just wonder why I am so seemingly stable yet my HR is so low. Is this going to be harmful over time? It seems that it doesn't take much in a change in exercise/diet to bring my heart rate that low, since this happened just a month or so into starting my ED habits (and at a point where I really hadn't lost much weight). Am I being stupid for not telling my doctor? I know that you're all going to tell me to talk to my doctor right away, but I feel convinced that, since everything else is stable (medically and emotionally), I don't want to see someone and have that number freak them out and trigger them to send me straight back to treatment. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

1309,1309,eating_disorders,"It was around 10th grade when I realised I don't like how I look. I used to be a skinny kid, but I guess my metabolism sucks because I started gaining weight when I turned thirteen even though nothing in my diet changed.

11th grade, we moved, my mom worked abroad and my dad was always busy, so my and my sister always ate alone. I took this as a chance to loose weight and avoided eating dinner. It worked, I lost weight and for a moment I was happy, but then I wasn't satisfied with it anymore. I had this classmate who was skinnier than most people in class, but not too skinny, so I decided that my goal was to be as skinny as her. So I avoided eating dinner and lunch, only eating biscuits when I'm hungry.

11th grade ended, and my weight did not change that much, only losing a few pounds here and there and then gaining it back for some reasons. I didn't know what i was doing wrong, so I researched. Then I discovered the world of calories and calorie counting. Apparently, the biscuits that I eat had tons of calories, therefore I wasn't really losing weight (because Im lazy as sh*t so I don't exercise). Not eating wasn't enough if some foods that I do eat had a lot of calories, therefore I ended up downloading an app to keep track of how many calories I've already intaked.

And it worked, my first goal was 1200, but then I started reading anorexia forums where I discovered that most eat calories lower than 500. So I thought, Imma do that as well. Although, I still have weakness around food, thus I can only reach around 900 calories a day. I decided I'll just stick to 900, because I'm still human, I still get hungry, and besides it's still lower than the required calories people needs to intake everyday.

At this point a lot of my relatives were noticing my weight. Keep in mind that I only used to be a skinny kid, when I turned thirteen my weight was around 54kg with the height of 5ft flat. So when when me and my twin sister visited them due to the holidays (both my parents were not with us because it's a long family drama that's still going on until now) my cousin forced me to stand on a scale. I was 39 kg.

Now, I know that that's a really low number for a weight, but considering that I'm small for my age, I don't think i was that thin. But they panicked, so they told our mom. The thing is, our mom was already scheduled to come home that year, but when she heard the news, she went home a lot earlier.  Long story short, mom and dad joined forces to feed me.

They assumed I was anorexic. I was never diagnosed, and honestly, I never reached the part where bones where obviously protuding out from me. I think they just noticed my drastic weight loss because they were so used to seeing me with a little fat. I had belly fat, thighs that touch all the freaking time, and most of my shirt sleeves were always about to pop off due to my huge arms.

I mean, I was going to stop starving myself when I reached my weight goal. 

Right now, the last time i checked, my weight was 45kg and my parents are making sure it won't drop any lower than that. Every family gathering, I was always that person that was anorexic, so everyone and their mother was always watching over me, always telling me to eat or something.

1313,1313,eating_disorders,"Need a place to vent because this issue causes me a lot of anger and stress for which I have no outlet at home.

My mother has had a binge eating disorder since she was young and has struggled with being overweight for most of her life. This is the tip of the iceberg, but to summarize, she has a long, unhealthy relationship with food that has given me my own body image and food issues.

It's been a large cause of sadness and insecurity for her for my entire life. I have memories from my early childhood of her crying over her weight when she thought she was alone, measuring out tiny portions of food at breakfast when she was ""on track,"" and seeing her gorging on fast food in her car before coming inside after work. During periods of weight gain she would try on her clothes, fail to fit into them, and say awful things about herself. ""I'm a whale, I can't fit into my clothes, I'm embarrassed to go out like this,"" etc. When I was young I'd fixate on the things she'd say about herself, and cry knowing that my mom, with whom I've always been very close and was very attached to as a kid, was so miserable in her own skin.

Her binging and weight problems are things we don't talk about, because it's such a source of shame for her that she avoids the conversation, and I don't want to force it on her by insisting we discuss it. It's uncomfortable, and I know she feels a lot of guilt and embarrassment.

The disordered behavior persisted into my teenage years, over which there were many incidents that I would never bring up again. She once saw that I was about to eat our last brownie and physically ripped it from my hands - she even pinched me hard enough that it hurt to make me let go of it. She was sheepish about it immediately after, and I could tell that she was embarrassed that she did it, and we've never talked about it since. I don't want her to feel ashamed or like she's a bad parent. The point in talking about it wouldn't be to shame her, it would be to find a way to help her, but her behavior keeps telling me she doesn't even want to change. She's in an endless cycle of deciding to change, talking endlessly about changing, doing it for a short while, and then going back to binging when staying ""on track"" becomes inconvenient.

I want to be very clear that I do not care if my mother is overweight. I'm not the one who wants her to lose weight. She wants to lose weight. I hear about it constantly. She wants to lose weight, while constantly making decisions that work against that because she refuses to address the psychological aspects to why she has an obsession with food and overeats compulsively. I'm constantly feeling frustrated and disappointed, not because I want her to be thin, but because I want her to be happy, and watching her sabotage herself repeatedly, knowing her actions are going to continue to make her miserable, is what makes me angry and resentful.

She regularly binges on anything containing carbs or sugar. It's one of my more trivial complaints, but carbs and sugar do not last more than a day in the house. Whether it's a box of cereal, cookies, a loaf of bread. The moment she sees it, I know it'll either be gone immediately or by the end of the day. (We've tried not keeping it in the house, she just finds it elsewhere.)  Just today she ate an entire bag of sandwich rolls I bought to make sandwiches with. The entire bag (6 rolls total) in a day, because she eats them as snacks. There goes my lunch plan for the week. Same goes for other foods as well. Multiple servings of leftovers meant to last the week? Gone. Again, part of a larger pattern of me preparing food meant to last days, portioning out the food in to-go containers to take to my job, and finding that she ate all or most of it in a single day.

I can't tell her to stop because 1) there's no way to say it without it sounding like I'm food-shaming her and hurting her feelings and 2) she's well aware that she needs to stop, and that in and of itself is not enough to get her to stop. Reminders from me to ""please don't eat the entire loaf of bread"" will not cause any change. It might sound petty to be angry at the inconvenience of running out of food - and I partially agree, it's not the worst consequence of someone's ED and she certainly suffers from it more than I do - but live with someone's disordered eating for 24 years and then tell me that. You eventually run out of patience, not only for the person's lack of consideration for you but also because you're watching them engage in an addiction that's making them miserable. 

What makes it so infuriating is that I can't be honest with her about these feelings. When she binges on food I had plans for, I can't tell her that it made me angry, even if she asks me what's wrong because being honest about it would hurt her feelings badly. She already has so much shame surrounding her binging, and I don't want her to feel like I'm another person judging her for her eating or her weight. So I keep it to myself, which causes the resentment to fester and grow worse, because that's what happens when you don't express your feelings. Sometimes I find that she ate an entire package of whatever food item in the pantry and want to scream, not over the food but because it's the same shit on a different day and I know I'll never be able to be open about it with her.

I'm embarrassed to admit that quickly-disappearing food in my house has made me a little bit food-aggressive, which makes me cringe even typing it. I don't mean to, but I have an impulse to make sure people don't take my food, for reasons I'm sure you can guess. I don't want to behave like that, I don't want to be a person who is paranoid that friends and family are going to steal food from my plate or leftovers from my fridge, but it's the result of living in a house where any food left out in the open disappears within the hour.  I used to hide food from her in my bedroom, which was the only place to keep it safe from her. If you can imagine how pathetic it is for a teenage girl to be stashing chocolate in her dresser just so she can have one treat to herself that her mother won't eat, you can imagine the shame around the conversation addressing my mom's binge eating and why we've never had it.

I realize that a family member's ED is not about me, which is another reason we don't talk about my frustrations regarding it. So I'm leaving them here instead.

Seeing her weight make her miserable from an early age, in hindsight, taught me that being fat is the worst thing that can happen to a person, something I can't consciously un-learn no matter how hard I try. I'm terrified of gaining weight and while I don't consider my diet and exercise habits excessive or unhealthy, my mental and emotional fixation with ""not gaining weight"" is decidedly not normal, to the point that it governs most of my food choices (I don't eat fast food, pizza, burgers, etc. not because I don't like it - I love it - but because the amount of stress I feel after isn't worth it to me) and sometimes takes a priority over other parts of my life (I've canceled plans with friends before to exercise because I'd gained a small amount of weight). I've gotten professional help for it, and am working on it with my therapist.

I was at least 40 pounds overweight in high school (I'm the same height now as I was then, 5""4', and pushing 170 pounds when now, at ten years older, I'm 130). I didn't realize how terrible my eating habits were because the only example I'd had set for me when I was young was my mom's terrible diet and disordered eating. Following her example, I'd thought it was normal to have three helpings at each meal, and to have fast food several times a week. I've tried to let go of the resentment I feel towards her for this, but it's hard to let go of it because being chubby was a huge part of the reason that I was miserable in high school. It gave me insecurities that followed me into adulthood. It was the reason I didn't start dating until college - no boys wanted to date me like the rest of my peers and it made me feel like something was wrong with me. All this happened because she'd deluded herself into thinking fast food four days a week was normal, or maybe she knew it wasn't but couldn't stop herself from doing it anyway. Either way, her bad decisions had consequences for me growing up, and I'm still angry at her about it and don't know how not to be. I feel that she was selfish in letting it affect me, for making terrible diet choices not only for herself but for me (I'm talking about an age before I could drive, and my only options were the food she brought home; once I started driving and was free to choose more of my own food, I lost some of the weight. I lost the rest of it when I went to college and moved out of her house completely).

TLDR; My mom is a binge eater and I've been watching her cyclical behavior for my entire life. She employs the same system of lying to herself, making excuses, playing the victim, etc. that all addicts use to justify their behavior. She's tried keto, intermittent fasting, paleo, pretty much any diet you can think of because she's willing to try anything to lose weight other than eating vegetables and jogging. I think she needs to address the psychological and emotional reasons behind her binging, but won't do it in any meaningful way. I don't want her to be thin, I want her to be happy, and being overweight makes her miserable. She talks about changing, I get onboard, then she quits days later and disappoints me. I don't know what  to change because I cannot do the work for her. I also have a hard time letting go of my anger toward her for the way her ED affected me growing up, namely making me overweight in high school because she fed me the same shit food she was eating, giving me a crippling fear of becoming overweight, and throw in a hint of embarrassing food-guarding habits because no food was ever safe from her in our house.

Advice would be appreciated, or thoughts from anyone who has similar experiences because I feel like the only person who struggles with this.

1316,1316,eating_disorders,"I've had an eating disorder for over 20 years. I've had periods of really solid recovery but that hasnt happened for a while. Last September I finally admitted I needed some more help and started a partial hospitalization program. For 8 mk ths I cycled through the different levels of treatment they offered (inpatient, residential, php, and iop). I was finally discharged in may, I felt strong and healthy and ready to take on the world again. I went back to work after 7 months of medical leave and I really thought I had beat it this time. But then 1 fateful day I decided to weigh myself at target. Since then I've been fighting to keep myself out of relapse. I bought a scale about a month ago and promised myself I wouldnt get obsessed. We all know that didnt last. My therapist (who doesn't specialize in eating disorders) got me to agree to weighing myself once a week and reporting my weight to him. I HATE  telling people my weight but hes trying to get me to not let the number have any power. He has given me the green light to lose weight through ""normal diet and exercise "". Today I met with my nutritionist for the first time in 3 weeks and she is concerned. I agreed to bring in my scale to our appt next week and to tell my therapist that him telling me I can lose weight is harmful and it's only feeding into my disorder. 

In addition I'm about to move into an apartment with a girl I met in treatment. We have become really close and agreed that we would only move in together if we r both in a good place. Well neither of us are in a great place and I am terrified that er r both gonna relapse when we live together. We are already feeding off each others disorders and the last 2x I've gone out to a restaurant with her I was so triggered by the food conversations that I purged immediately after. She literally asked me to teach her how to do it. I obviously said no fucking way but I'm scared that things are gonna go downhill fast. I've lost 4 pounds since friday and its fueling the fire big time. I gained so much weight in recovery and I cant stand my body right now. Part of me wants to keep going and just try to ""control"" how much i relapse and part of me is so damn tired of being obsessed and i just wanna eat what i want when i want.

Long story short, this self awareness feels worse than actually being in a full blown relapse....which is where my nutritionist is convinced I'm heading right now. My mom is cooking dinner and my anxiety over having to eat it is raging but still....I dont feel like I've lost total control.

1318,1318,eating_disorders,"I’ve been recovered for almost 4 years. Since then I’ve fluctuated a lot in weight, and have been okay. I have epilepsy and because of that I take a lot of medications, really causing my weight always going up and down. August 2019 I got off of all of my SSRI medications which cause you to gain weight and I slimmed down immediately, I was stoked. One medication I was left on is an appetite suppressant, which I didn’t know at the time. I guess that’s when it started. 

I was skinny, but okay. But I liked it. Then I guess if I would feel fat, I just wouldn’t eat until the next day. Things that I could excuse as NOT ED behavior, because it wasn’t nearly as extreme as what I had been doing. I’m hungry, but I’m in the middle of this episode. But I have to watch the next episode too! Can’t eat... now I have to walk my dog, I don’t have time to eat. Well now I’m sweaty so I have to shower. Well, now I’m not even hungry anymore.

I’m also angry that at myself. I don’t know if I knew subconsciously what I was doing or not. And I’m sad for my mom, I had to call her and tell her today, and she said she already knew. That she’s already been looking into treatment centers for when I realize that I’m ready. I hate knowing I’m breaking her heart. 

When people would come to me and ask me if I was relapsing, I would get so sad and be so confused because I would have no idea how they could think that. I would look at my body and say what? I look perfectly fine, what do you mean you think I’m relapsing?

1328,1328,eating_disorders,"My problem with food dates back to the scarcity of it in my childhood. That being said, im an adult with enough money for food now. Yet i am very imbalanced. In always after more, so i have cut myself back a lot.

I also think i have a money problem that ties into the food problem. At the beginning of the year I bought sams club bags of rice and beans, stored them in mylar bags, and gave myself an allowance of $10 a week for food to go with it. Bananas, roma tomatoes, and jalapenos are suuuper cheap so ive lived off of those, and mangos when they were half off. 

I wanted to try this out for a year to see what it was like. I went from spend $80 a week on whatever I wanted to that. 

In order to not let myself fully freak and break, if someone offers me junk food i take it. 

For a while that was ok. I was saving enough of my food money to buy something extra every couple of weeks. Then the pandemic happened. That freaked me out and i went into super savings mode. Now I only spend money on bills. 

When all I have is rice and beans, no fruits or veggies, i freak the fuck out. I tell myself in my logical way that i obviously have food but the addictious feeling permeates from my body. Anxiety. I cave and use my mattress money to buy food so i dont go against my no spending rule. My body gets so weak from psychological torment when i notice that's ""all"" i have. People can live off of that though. Im not dying. 

My neighbor bought me a small pizza today as a thank you for something. I could feels the waves of addictive thoughts. I could feel how very low i would become if i ended up not getting the pizza. It had nothing to do with my hunger. I wasn't hungry. I have food. 

I ate the whole pizza. I feel like if i didnt quit smoking cigs, the food obsession wouldn't be so bad. 

So now the question is, what do I do? I dont want to give in to my addiction to food. I want to be able to live off of what i have and just be ok with that. 

Maybe im looking at this all wrong. Idk how else to look at it though. 

Im not poor. I can get food if i want to. I just want to live like this to try to stop myself from freaking out over it. To show my brain that everything will be ok.

1335,1335,eating_disorders,"I've been suffering from mixed eating disorder (alternated anorexia and bulimia phases) since I was 13. My usual attitude is to eat too much and feel just a bit guilty about it, until I gain a certain weight and start throwing up and skipping some meals until I completely stop eating. This usually goes on until something big happens that makes it easier to ignore the fact that I'm repugnant and don't deserve eating. Usually, it's the start of a relationship or help from my loved one.
In the period before the quarantine my anorexia phases had become overwhelming. When I then started a new relationship with my bestfriend, whom I'd been in love with for a while but initially rejected because of personal complexes, I slowly started eating again.
We've been together for almost 5 months now, and I did have some mental breakdowns about my weight. The only thing preventing me from starvation is seeing how he suffers about it. It literally makes me want to be better for him. However, I think those short mental breakdowns were just punctures, because now I'm really falling back into anorexia. And the real problem is... this often comes with some kind of side effect, which completely shuts down my sentimental (sentimental only) sphere. So I start living relationships like I'm acting in a movie, without feeling it. Kisses, hugs, caresses, they all become a mechanical habit moved by no affection. If I think of my boyfriend now, he's a friend. My closest and dearest friend, like before we committed, but still just a friend. And even though I know this is probably just a phase, it paralyses me, because we've had this problem since the beginning - I didn't want a relationship with him despite feeling completely addicted to him, until I gave up my shields and let go, accepting his love. However, everytime I feel slightly less in love with him, the fear that I might have made the wrong choice by starting our relationship comes back. 'Cause, maybe I'm not really in love, maybe I just got carried away, maybe it was just a moment, maybe sex, habit and addiction is what keeps me with him, I don't know and I can't know... The only thing I know is I run away everytime I'm scared, and now I'm terrified by both the possibilities that he really is not meant for me as a partner, AND that I will run away in denial despite this (not) feeling being just a phase... I feel so trapped like I got myself into something I cannot handle and he makes me the most happy person in the world, but... sometimes I wonder if I really am in love with him, or if I just want him in my life so much that I accepted being together and lying to myself that I love him, just to hurt him no longer and lose him not. And while I think of all this I started throwing up again, and I don't wanna eat anymore and this situation makes me feel so bad about myself that anorexia gets worse and damn I really feel like I can't make it, I just wanna starve until I die out of this...",,I'm falling into anorexia again and I'm terrified it might ruin my relationship.,2,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hzgwev,1,Lilith_Kea,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hzgwev/im_falling_into_anorexia_again_and_im_terrified/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hzgwev/im_falling_into_anorexia_again_and_im_terrified/,1595950868,544,0,0,0,-1,1,"Mixed eating disorder (alternated anorexia and bulimia phases), starting a new relationship",harmful,"Started eating again due to new relationship, but mental breakdowns about weight have occurred, Anorexia is resurfacing and causing emotional detachment from partner, Fear that the writer may not actually be in love with their partner and is only staying due to addiction or habit",Mixed eating disorder and starting a new relationship,harmful,"New relationship led to some improvement in the writer's eating disorder, but now they are falling back into anorexia, Anorexia is causing the writer to shut down emotionally and question their feelings for their partner, Fear of losing their partner and feeling trapped in the relationship is causing the writer to spiral further into their eating disorder",Mixed eating disorder and starting a new relationship,harmful,"Starting a new relationship helped the writer slowly start eating again, The fear of losing the relationship has caused the writer to fall back into anorexia, Anorexia is causing the writer to have trouble with their sentimental sphere and to question their feelings for their partner"
1336,1336,eating_disorders,"⚠️ Trigger warning: self harm, mention of school shooting, depression and mental health.⚠️


Here’s a little backstory: I (under 18F) have been suffering from mental health issues for a while. Unfortunately I don’t feel safe or respected enough in my family to ask for help/therapy or to get tested for disorders/mental illness I think I might have. At first I was pushing everything bad into the deepest part of me and ignoring how I felt (not a great coping mechanism I know). But a little over a year ago I was in a school shooting. This had broken the wall I kept up to block out all my depression and anxiety. I was suddenly getting an anxiety attack at least once a day and started to fall into a depressive spiral. My coping mechanisms weren’t working and unfortunately I turned to self harm as a form of release. I soon became addicted. But then my neighbor was institutionalized for just thinking about self harm. The anxiety and fear of people finding out and throwing me into a psych ward was too much to handle so I stoped. It took a lot for me to recover but for a while I was better. Then we went into quarantine. My mom just had to start commenting on my weight (witch is about average for my age group but centers around my stomach) and forcing me into exercising. Needless to say my self-esteem and self worth took a drastic dip, my depression and anxiety found something new to latch onto. My weight.

At first I was just skipping some meals, like 2-3 meals a week. Then it turned into 5, then I started skipping breakfast every day. Right now I’m skipping breakfast and lunch (I can’t skip dinner as I eat with family but I eat as little as possible and Im positive that if I could I would). I have lost about 35 pounds in a month. But even though I have lost weight I still look the same, and it makes me feel worse. My mom keeps commenting on my weight and she will poke fun at my stomach and pinch my fat. It makes me so mad sometimes, I have told her to stop and why it makes me so upset when she does that. She just keeps doing it and ignoring my mental health, focusing on my brother who has one panic attack and gets to go to a therapist but I get like 10 a week and I’m just “faking it for attention”.

But now for why I titled this what I did. I like the pain that I get from the hunger. Is this a common thing? I always thought that eating disorders (not saying I have one, not tested and all) were about the weight. Recently my mother stopped her comments, and I still feel awful about my weight. I tried to start eating normal again (starting slow of course as to not overwhelm myself) but I found myself missing the feeling of being hungry. I found myself becoming nauseous at just the thought of eating. I found myself constantly staring into a mirror and standing on a scale hating how I look. But when I’m hungry I feel numb, sometimes even happy. I don’t feel fat. Without the constant pain I feel lost and depressed and my attacks are much worse. So I’m still not eating. I’m getting worried with myself. I feel as though I’m addicted to the pain of hunger just as I was with self harm. And I don’t know if there’s anything that can pull me out this time. I realize what I’m doing is harmful but I can’t stop, and I can’t get help from my family, and I have too much anxiety to ask my friends. I just don’t know what do do anymore.

Honestly I just need to rant and get this off my chest but any help/advice is appreciated.

1340,1340,eating_disorders,"As the title says I sometimes strongly think I was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder. I started therapy with an intern therapist last year for anxiety and other things. After a couple months she told me that I had an eating disorder and should start seeing a dietian. Basically what I told her that made her come to this conclusion: I have always hated my body, hated my body in photos, hated certain features of mine, always been self conscious, been bullied for how I look, etc. I had gained a little weight during that time after moving and wanted to lose about 10-15lbs to be back where I was before, especially since my wedding was approaching at that time. I was counting calories (only eating 1400 a day) working out occasionally. A lot of times I would go over 1400 calories. I was losing weight but verryyyyy slowly. I also follow a vegetarian diet (after seeing the dietian I realized I wasnt getting enough protein which I think was causing me to get sick a lot but now I know). In addition, my mom had an eating disorder at my age (she was anorexic and wouldn't eat for days). When I was around 15 I noticed I had gained some weight and started to skip dinners and I would lose 1lb every day. I got pretty low in weight (under a normal BMI) and my friend's grandma made a comment to me about being too skinny so I felt embarrassed and realized what I was doing was probably bad and stopped and just stayed at a normal weight after that. At the time I was fluctuating in weight around [135-140 lbs](#s) at 5'6"". I felt like I was ""fat"" and a lot of times I did look really fat because I was super bloated from GI issues (that later the dietian helped me fix). So with all these things she told me I didn't have Body Dysmorphia but had an ED. I was kinda shocked to be honest.

So I started seeing the dietian because I did want to get to the bottom of my GI problems but also wanted to hear them out on what I should be eating. She had me eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, wayyyy more than I have ever ate before. I told her this was too much food but she told me this is what I needed. I told her I was afraid of gaining weight and she told me I wouldn't. For awhile I wasnt gaining weight until a few months in it all hit me. My thighs began to touch and I couldn't fit into my clothes anymore. This was my worst fear and it sent me into a depression. I am still depressed and still unable to fit into my clothes, I am sooo uncomfortable and I feel like no one is listening to me. I have thought about purging and starving myself, things I never thought about before because I feel so desperate to lose this extra weight. 

Recently I gave some old clothes to a friend who to me looks so incredibly skinny and when she fit into my old clothes perfectly I was literally mind blown. I look back at old pictures of myself and realize I was at my goal weight and feel upset that no one told me I had body dysmorphia until it was too late. I know it would have taken a while to get me to see my body for how it was at that time but I wish someone would have helped me. My new therapist told me I do in fact have body dysmorphia but she has also always been under the impression I have an eating disorder from what my old therapist has told my dietian who has now told me new therapist (they work together). After giving it a lot of thought a huge part of me believes that yes I probably was high risk for developing an eating disorder but I was just dieting at the time (many people count calories and eat less then I was to lose weight but they werent diagnosed with eating disorders) I knew that being underweight was wrong and I wasnt striving to be that I just wanted to be on the lower end of my BMI. So I am just so frustrated with everyone and everything and I have been thinking real hard about dropping my therpist and dietian because they want me to accept my body how it is right now and I told them I will not do that because I am very uncomfortable and I want to lose this extra weight safely but I want to be in my old clothes and feel comfortable again. I end up leaving sessions with them feeling more depressed than before because they make me feel like I'm not allowed to lose weight. Also when I look up eating disorders I dont fit into any of the definitions so if my old therapist was wrong about my body dysmorphia maybe she was wrong about me having an eating disorder?

1341,1341,eating_disorders,"Hello. I am a 22 year old college student who has been suffering from depression and anxiety since middle school and an eating disorder since high school. I have been really down in the dumps lately because my dad has gotten laid off for the second time and I'm trying to finish up my bachelors, only to get news that one of the classes that I needed to graduate in May that I was signed up for the Fall semester has been cancelled. This class is only offered in the Fall so that's a really fun time for me because this is the third time this has happened to me at this same uni. I have been feeling so stressed and overwhelmed lately and I know I shouldn't be worried about being unable to help my parents, but due to covid-19 I live with them again instead of on campus.

To say that I have relapsed sounds like a huge understatement to me at this point. Summer of 2019, I finally reached 100 lbs. It was the first time I reached that weight and I was proud because I did so mostly healthily. I still had a decent amount of stomach fat, but not as much as a few years ago (to put it in better perspective I'm only 4'10). When I came home early from college in March, I weighed around 92 lbs. I maintained it until June and even gained 2 lbs in muscle weight which I was proud of (I really love having muscle). Now, between June and today, I now weigh 83 lbs. I feel like I'm a walking skeleton. I didn't intentionally want to lose weight because I lose weight very easily. I think it's primarily the stress and depression I've been feeling. Due to my family and I still trying to look for work but we can only work online because we're all high risk, it has been hard to find any work at all AND I also have to worry about paying my tuition for my supposed final year.

I guess my main question is how can I get myself to slowly overcome this? I feel like I don't really have somewhere or someone to turn to because my dad doesn't understand it because he hasn't been through it. It just doesn't click for him even though he's done research on his own about it and I can see how much it frustrates him that he doesn't know what to do to help. It frustrates me just as equally because I don't even know what I need to beat this either. A lot of times I don't feel like getting out of bed and I feel like I'm having to force myself to eat because I don't get hungry anymore again. I think it's hitting me even harder because I worked so hard working out and eating more so that I can build muscle and I worked out and ate 3 meals a day for a solid 6 months. I don't gain weight easily, but I know how to put on pounds if I try hard enough. The problem is that I don't have the energy or the willpower to cook and eat. Another part of the problem is that I'm uncomfortable eating with my mom, but since I'm home I have to deal with that pretty much every day now. My mom used to tell me a lot in middle school that I was eating like a man and that I ""shouldn't be pigging out because I'll get fat"" and ""I'm a girl and she didn't raise me like that."" I feel that got ingrained in my brain and once I got badly injured playing sports and that depression set in, that all came flooding back.

How can I get over the uncomfortable feeling of eating around my mom? How can my dad help me get better? What are some steps I can take to get myself to eat more? I really want to get better again, I REALLY do. I don't want to lose anymore weight. I feel so weak, frail and un-energized and I just want to beat this thing. I just feel so lost atm and I know it's something I can't tell my mom either because she would just tell me to suck it up and eat and my younger sister is worried that I'll die after watching a traumatizing video about eating disorders apparently.

Thank you for your help. I'm normally not good at asking for help but, I *really* need help. I can't do this on my own...

P.S. I hope this makes sense. I am very tired atm as I have been up for 24 hours due to insomnia haha...",,How Do I Bounce Back?,8,,tw: numbers,,,EDNOS,t5_2zzq8,hwz0pk,1,ChristineBrillon,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hwz0pk/how_do_i_bounce_back/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hwz0pk/how_do_i_bounce_back/,1595584470,795,0,0,1,-1,1,"Stressful life events, depression, anxiety, negative comments from mother about eating",harmful,"Experiencing a severe relapse in eating disorder, losing weight unintentionally, Feeling uncomfortable eating around mother due to past negative comments, Lack of energy and willpower to cook and eat, Feeling lost and in need of help","Stress and depression from family and academic issues, negative comments from mother about eating like a man",harmful,"Significant weight loss and relapse in eating disorder, Difficulty eating due to lack of energy and willpower, Uncomfortable eating around mother due to past negative comments","Stress from family and school, depression and anxiety",harmful,"Experiencing a relapse in her eating disorder, Loss of weight and muscle mass, Difficulty finding the energy or willpower to eat, Uncomfortable eating around her mom due to past negative comments, Lack of support from her dad who doesn’t understand her eating disorder"

1350,1350,eating_disorders,"23 yo/female.
Hi everyone! I have been bullied all my teenage years for being fat. 
Things changed when I was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (genetic) and diabetes. I always had hypothyroidism as a child.
I lost a lot of weight as I watched my eating habits.
Losing the weight and feeling included within the social context I was in, felt so good. People were finally listening to me after years of being neglected. I became obsessed and soon was excessively underweight. 
Then I had to move abroad alone. I felt devastated with the loneliness. I found a friend in food. I started binge eating. Initially nothing changed. But soon my health started worsening. I still am not overweight, I have started strength training for a year now. Somedays are really good. But other days, I eat like a monster during the night. My blood sugars are a mess. It is so high in the morning. I feel like I am slowly killing myself. 
My housemates are aware of my condition, I have explained it to them. I did so to avoid binging on their food ( I become a different person during midnight ). But they don't take me seriously. I have some nights binged on their food and the shame I wake up with in the morning makes me feel like killing myself. They whisper around me about the situation and I cannot stop crying in the bedroom. I don't want to touch any of their food, but I always end up doing it... I continuosly compensate by buying them food and groceries for free. I wanted to change my accommodation but given my budget, I am not able to find anything suitable. More so I don't know if I will ever be able to explain my situation to anyone...

People are nice to me. I do respect my housemates. But I have started to disrespect myself.. I feel trapped and unable to communicate my issue with them..

Please suggest if you all have any ideas about what should I do?

Please don't be mean in the comments. I won't be able to absorb that right now!

1355,1355,eating_disorders,"Hi. I've just joined reddit because i'm really confused and I was wondering if you could help me. First thing first, i'm sorry if my english is not perfect, but i'm not a native speaker.

I'm scared i might be developing an ed, but i don't know if i'm just impressionable and insecure. 
Well, tbh i AM insecure. I have a low self esteem and i see myself as ugly (constantly thinking that i'll be pretty when i lose weight) therefore i'm often sad. 
I find it really difficult to lose weight. 
My Bmi is considered in the 'normal' range but i see myself as really fat: i always wear baggy clothes, going to the beach is traumatic, and so on. I'm worried that other people might judge me, but my family and some of my friends ( the ones whom i feel kinda ""comfortable"" talking to about certain topics)  tell me that i'm not fat. I'm sure they do that to make me feel better, but this way i feel even worse, i feel like i'm a burden.

Regarding the calories, it's difficult for me to count them because i'm not the one cooking so i don't know how much, e.g. oil there is in my food, but i eat about 600/700 calories per day. 
When i eat, i feel like i'm binging, i feel out of control and guilty, but there are times when i'm really strict and i feel good.
 By the way, whenever i feel like i've binged i ask my mother how much i've eaten and she tells me everytime that i haven't eaten much (she used to tell me when i was eating too much so i can rely on her opinions).

There are also periods when i'm really strict, i lose some weight but then i became obsessed with certain foods and i can't help but eat them.
I don't fast, but i don't know if it is because i can't ( my parents wouldn't allow me to, they would notice if i didn't eat and get really pissed) or if i don't want to.
 Now i'm eating a little less than usual and i've lost some weight.

i dont think i have an eating disorder, but i dont know what else to call this *thing* im going through.

i eat as little as i can because im fat. others say im skinny, they say im losing way to much weight, but i know theyre lying. i have this disgusting belly, thighs that are definitely bigger than normal, gross flabby arms, and an ugly double chin.

 i still eat much more than id like, to stop my family from worrying. where i come from, a meal isnt a meal without rice, so i have to eat at least half a bowl with every dish. but even then, i still get hungry, and i “binge.” i raid the kitchen at 3 in the morning and retreat to my room with chips and cake and sweets. 

i dont feel bad about it until im about fall asleep, at 7 in the morning, and so i grab something sharp and start dragging cuts along my forearm. and thats where i am currently.

i still eat everyday, and i dont purge. does this still sound like having an ed? what should i do? i absolutely cannot talk to a professional, or to my parents, im already a disappointment and i dont want to seem like a whiny child. my friends will probably brush it off as a joke, some have also told me you need to be diagnosed to truly have a disorder.

For the past few days I feel absolutely sick to my stomach from right after I eat until I go to sleep which could b hours. Every time I feel this way, I am lying in bed and thinking about just how easy it would b to purge everything very quickly. 

I purged for the first time last summer and after doing it almost daily for about 3 months I lost over 30 lbs which, since I am quite large, was met w a lot of admiration by my family and peers. As much as I wanted to change my appearance, I felt self conscious about other ppl noticing my change bc they would go out of their way to comment and I didn’t want anyone to catch on to what I was doing. I had a lot of mixed emotions about doing it but mainly I finally felt good about myself. I looked back on pictures of myself from the summer before and was revolted by how swollen I looked and finally felt light and freed from the pain of being super fat. I was still fat but at least I wasn’t the same as before. By the time February rolled around I had lost roughly 40 lbs. 

Anyway fast forward to now; I’ve gained 16 lbs since quarantine started but it feels like more, I feel like I did before I lost any weight at all. My pants don’t fit and I just feel so disgusting whenever I happen to look in the mirror. Ever since I noticed that I had basically blown up Its been eating at me (no pun intended). 

My mom bought a scale that measures ALL OF THE STATS— weight water muscle BMI bmr bone mass visceral fat etc — and ever since I stepped on it I have felt like shit. I literally feel disgusting as if I didn’t already feel that way. Every time I eat anything I feel so disconnected from my body as if I can’t believe that I’m eating a meal and I feel disgusting I feel pounds being added on I feel like a pig and like I should stop eating but I just can’t for whatever reason. And after I’m done I feel so full and disgusting and nauseous that I want to go and purge it all. If I did someone would hear, so I don’t. 

This is the first time I have ever identified these feelings as an urge to purge and I feel very fucked up. I gave in once 2 days ago bc I had smoked a bunch of cigs after eating heavy greasy foods and had to get it out and it felt like “well hello my dear old friend, welcome back to my warm loving arms”. So I’m a little scared bc now im worse than i was before and I will one hundo percent give in to these urges soon and don’t know what to do.

1363,1363,eating_disorders,"I used to have a real bad anorexia and I never really healed so to say, but nowadays I'm 151cm and 55kg (muscular body type). Even tho I'm ""clean"" I still have a dietician that I see about once every two weeks (now during corona it's been a videochat). I had a call with my dietician yesterday and it turns out that during these two weeks I lost about 3kg. Not bad if you ask me, but I did tell my biological mother and she got furious. She went off on me telling me how sickening it is that I'm still trapped in the mindset that I need to lose weight. I told her it's not that, I just haven't felt good. She still thinks it's my subconscious that makes me lose weight. I'm not saying she's wrong, but the fact that she actually yelled at me for that small amount just irritated me. An hour after that, my adoption mother called me and started to question my health status and she now thinks I'm relapsing. I told my SO that I lost some weight and before I could continue, they started to nag me how I should eat more. I'm not talking about like a banana or two more, a whole ass meal more. Then I told them I think it's unfair how my biological mother went off on me and they were actually taking my mother's side, making this a big deal! I don't think it is, but how can I convince them that it isn't? I can't leave them in the dark, I tried in the past but that just sparks up rumors and more yelling... It once got to the point that my biological mother said I can't visit her if she doesn't know for a fact that the same old skeleton is not going to visit her, so we made a deal that I'm honest while being private (I don't tell her where my cals come from, I just tell the weight).",,"Everyone's either judgemental or just overly worried, help!",11,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hnyakt,1,alextrande,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hnyakt/everyones_either_judgemental_or_just_overly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hnyakt/everyones_either_judgemental_or_just_overly/,1594276854,337,0,0,0,-1,1,Seeing a dietician for support,harmful,"Lost 3kg in two weeks, leading to concerns from family and SO about relapse, Biological mother yelled at the user for losing weight, causing irritation and stress, SO is nagging the user to eat more, adding to stress and pressure",Seeing a dietician for recovery,harmful,"Lost 3kg in two weeks, Negative reactions from biological and adoption mothers as well as significant other, Feeling frustrated and misunderstood by loved ones",Seeing a dietician for regular check-ins,harmful,"Lost 3kg in two weeks, Received negative reactions from biological and adoptive mothers and SO for the weight loss"
1364,1364,eating_disorders,"as child and tween i was obese and im sure my parents meant well because since kindergarten i had cried from being fat shamed and begged for help altering my appearance. it begin with my parents monitoring 5 year old me's eating pattern and withholding sweets and junk food (but still keeping it in the house). then in the third grade my low self esteem surrounding my body image became almost unbearable. my mom enrolled me in our local weight watchers program (which in hindsight dieting is EXTREMELY terrible for a 9 year old) and tracking my calorie intake and weekly meetings provided me with the accountability and feeling of control over my body that i deeply craved (i think its important to state that i have OCD so i constantly crave 100% certainty and control). i was the only child there and everyone absolutely adored me and lost weight (but of course since it was a fad diet i always gained it back). then my parents started offering me an incentive to lose weight by taping envelopes with money and goal dates to achieve a specific weight on a special date in our kitchen (spoiler alert this didn't work either). next, they brought me to a nutritionist when i was about 10 where my nutritionist recommended fat dissolving pills to a fucking 10 year old. as you can imagine all of this was traumatizing and more than damaging to my life long body image. ive always been popular but i got fed up with no boys ever having crushes on me and using me to get to my friends, so i decided to begin starving myself when i was about 12. i ate 200-400 calories a day which was always about OMAD and as you can imagine i miraculously dropped 35 lbs in a few months. everyone was floored and wanted to know how i had miraculously dropped that weight and even then i knew i shouldnt go around saying i was starving myself so i lied and said i religiously followed a calorie counting app and the accountability it possessed was the biggest contributor to my weight loss. all the boys i had secretly crushed on for years began writing me love songs, sending me poems, asking my dad to take me to dances a year in advance, and constantly complimenting me providing me with the validation i desired. im not gonna lie it was amazing and fueled my body image issues even more because now i could have just about any guy i wanted and was the most popular girl in my class. the thing was a still hated my body and i couldnt understand why. as soon as i was learning to accept a body that i didnt feel like i deserved i developed severe cystic acne that just got progressively worse over about 8 months where i tried every antibiotic, topical ointment, and skincare routine out there. i spent hours researching ways to mask my hideous skin and began spiraling into a depressive state. i started going to weekly therapy and was in a constantly irritable state and cried about twice daily. before this i was amazing at masking my emotions but then i didnt give a fuck and i just cried whenever and wherever. my relationship with my parents was beyond strained and i contemplated self harm but didnt want the scars. i ate my way through the emotional pain because despite my therapist begging my parents to put me on antidepressants they refused and told me ""i would be hazy and numb"". i was thirteen at the time and i had always been a model student and a teacher's pet but this aggression and hopelessness made me want to be rebellious. i began drinking alcohol to stifle my sadness on a very regular basis, cussing constantly, trying smoking, and i even wound up getting suspended and involved in every bout of drama. i began eating and drinking away my hopelessness and this caused a weight gain. then in march of this year my doctor prescribed accutane and finally my skin is clear four-ish months later, but now i have to cope with the weight gain. im not heavy if u look a chart and deep down i know that, but my self hatred and body dysmorphia have convinced me otherwise. i tried throwing up the food but i have an extremely sensitive gag reflex, so it was too painful and difficult. so i began using twice the recommended dosage of laxatives daily if i binged or having OMAD and drinking zero calorie energy drinks, sugar free gum, pickles, and unsweetened tea to suppress my stomach's growls. i have a thin figure and 34DD breasts so obviously people dont perceive me as someone who typically suffers from body dysmorphia, but i will never feel confident because i will never feel as thin as my 21"" waist prepubescent peers. i find myself constantly seeking validation and pushing away everyone who cares about me. i check my body's appearance by lifting my shirt in every reflective surface in the hopes that a thinner figure will stare back at me. i watch amberlynn reid videos to suppress my appetite and fuel my thinspo. im absolutely spiraling and relapsing right now and even though my close friends and immediate family know about my struggles with food they fail to ever check-in on me or even care. i put on a brave face and fake my happiness and lie to those around me saying im doing better than ever with my confidence and body image because i hate when people pry into my diet. i remember comments people have made a decade ago about my body and use it as fuel for weight loss. i cant even put on a bikini at my own home so on my recent tropical vacation i wore spandex and and an oversized tee in the pool. i am so hungry but i cant risk feeling out of control. nobody ever says the right thing and i desperately need some advice from like minded people. it's 10pm and today ive had a packet of oatmeal, a glass of apple juice, and some unsweetened tea and gum to suppress my stomach growling. i spent hours watching amberlynn reid eat so i can enjoy it vicariously through her. no one is concerned because im told i have a desired figure now and before i was heavy but im definitely mentally fucked up. i cant even eat my ""trigger foods"" like pizza or chocolate or mac and cheese at all even if i purge and i cant eat if people are watching for fear of their judgment. please help.",,please read i am desperate

I’ve had extreme weight gain and extreme weight loss,

so about 3 months ago I just decided I was done and lost 30 pounds in 3 months. It started off healthy, as it always does, but as I lost more weight the obsessive behaviors got worse and worse. at this point eating any single thing in a day makes me feel like shit and a genuine fucking failure. I’m on the verge of passing out all the fucking time, the last thing I ate was 20 pieces of fucking goldfish days ago, and the only thing I can allow myself to do is drink and smoke. Is it going to be like this forever? I just hate this, the idea of eating is SO HORRIBLE. I feel as though my ex boyfriend left me bc I gained weight and now I just feel as if no one will ever love me until I’m so fucking skinny. My friends comments on the lack of food make it worse, and push me further into not eating anything.

However the last couple weeks I have really been struggling with all the weight gain and body image. Plus theres just a lot going on in my personal life that feels chaotic and out of my control. I slowly started cutting things out of my MP. In the last week I've purged twice (when I first started tx it was every time I ate basically...which wasnt often). Since getting out of residential in march up until a couple weeks ago I had only purged 2x. Now it's been twice in the span of less than 7 days. I bought a scale, I'm restricting a LOT and I feel like my ed thoughts are starting to take over again. I met with my therapist yesterday who was like ""sooo....ur spiraling"" and I denied that I was. But the more i think about it, maybe hes right. He asked me not to weigh myself until at least wed (when i meet with my nutritionist and can process it with someone) and I agreed....but I got home and weighed myself anyway. And did it again this morning. I decided to actually have breakfast this morning (I havent had an actual meal all week except once. I've been surviving on coffee, adderall and the occasional protein bar).

1383,1383,eating_disorders,"So for some context, I've had a really unhealthy relationship with food on and off for the past sevenish years. I don't want to go into to much detail because I don't want to unintentionally give anyone ideas, but I have a history of starving myself. I'm twenty now and in the past year I've lived in an apartment with some close friends at college. Having the freedom to buy my own groceries, cook for myself, and eat what I want when I want has really helped me develop a healthy relationship with food. I was eating more whole foods, more consistently, and I was feeling really good about it. However, since returning home for the summer and having that freedom taken away - it has been really difficult for me to maintain that healthy relationship.

In high school and middle school my mom recognized that I was eating poorly, but she only acknowledged it by bringing me small things when I was on the verge of passing out or making comments like ""Are you going to eat today?"". Besides that, I had never gotten help or been taken into a doctor for a proper diagnosis. My dad would also get angry at me if I ever cooked for myself (yelling at me if I just used the toaster) because he thought I would make a mess or ""burn the house down"". My own issues with my body paired with the fear of making my dad angry brought me to a point where I would only eat a snack or two in an entire day.

Both of my parents are overweight and have been trying to lose weight together (my dad needs to lose weight in order to have a surgery done and my mom has been ""dieting"" with him). They are no longer buying any bread or snacks and all around the kitchen my mom has posted notes saying things like ""STOP, before you cheat..."", ""Say no to \_\_\_\_"", etc.. Being back home has been really difficult for me and I've found myself reverting back to bad habits - except now it feels worse because there is nothing I can eat as a grab-and-go kind of thing. The notes have been really triggering for me, my parents don't cook for me, and I am still afraid to make food for myself because of what has happened in the past.

With the pandemic too - money has been really tight and I haven't been able to get a job to support myself. Any time I bring up needing something with my parents (body wash, a haircut, etc) it is brushed off and ignored so I'm not getting a lot of my needs met. If I say I'm hungry or craving something - my mom suggests a ""healthier alternative"" which is also triggering to me because I'm trying not to look at everything I eat as being ""good"" or ""bad"". I feel like in losing a lot of my freedom by being home, I'm also losing my progress. I feel very alone and discouraged.

I'm thinking of putting together a grocery list of things I need and asking if they can pick those things up the next time they go grocery shopping. I'm just really nervous about what being home is doing to my relationship with my body and I'm afraid to talk to them about the things that are really triggering to me (the notes, being afraid to cook).

Mostly, I've had anorexia although had a few periods of bulimia over the years. I've had multiple rounds of treatment of all kinds over the years (hospitalizations, residential, day treatment, outpatient). 

I was discharged from residential about a year and a half ago at my highest weight ever (130 lbs at 5'3). I relapsed 6 months later and lost all the weight I had gained in treatment plus a bit more. I have been relapsed ever since then (coming up a year now). I had made a bit of progress in the month or so before COVID happened and had gained a bit of weight back. Once COVID hit I lost all my outpatient support and could not be weighed weekly anymore. In the last few months during COVID I have regressed quite badly and lost the bit of weight I had gained back. I have been trying so hard the last month to get back on track but my ED is way too strong, I am out of my depth. I know I need to go back to treatment but due to COVID there is zero help available. All of the inpatient and residential centres are shut down. I can't even get a doctor to see me in person to assess my medical stability and I can feel that my body is not doing well.

For example, I have been feeling a little anxious over the last couple of days, and while before I may have felt a little queasy and lost my appetite, I now get SO queasy that I have to sit by the toilet (or end up throwing up without warning) and can’t get on with my day!

Was wondering if anyone else has experienced this, could explain it or offer tips on how to get this to subside?

So with that being said I have recently been working out excessively and purging more than I ever have been before. And almost everyone in my family has commented on “how good I have been looking” and how “my hard work has really started to pay of.”

I have never had anyone romantically interested in me either, so when a coworker of mine revealed feelings for me I felt like it was reward of sorts for my behavior. 

It feels like everyone in my life is proud of me and my weight loss... and as much as I hate to say it I am kind of proud of myself too. Yet I feel the worst I ever have. My head and throat always hurt, my muscles constantly ache, and I feel disgusting in my body despite the weight loss.

1396,1396,eating_disorders,"TW: I go into details about my ED experience.

I realise that this whole post is very “pick me” energy but I feel it might be helpful for me to tell someone, even if it’s random internet strangers. It’s long. You don’t have to read it if you don’t want to, I’m mostly just posting it to vent.

I always get SAD in the winter, but this one was especially worse. I have a lot of intrusive thoughts, even when it’s not related to anorexia, but I’m someone who prides myself on being able to ignore them and move on. I was 5’7 and 166 pounds. That’s the heaviest I’ve ever been. I was overweight, just slightly. I felt so so so fat. I got more and more guilty every time I ate. I started looking up calories after I ate and worrying over them. I ate a slice of Costco pizza and realised it was 700 calories. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

So I stopped eating, of course. I was living under 200 calories a day. I hated it a first, I love food. But then I started seeing results. A flat stomach first, and then skinner legs (I have a pear-shaped body, quite bottom-heavy. I have *really* big thighs). Then I started to love it. I dropped almost 20 pounds in two weeks at my worst. I had a locked thinspo album on my phone and I developed rituals. I had one I called “forfeit” where in the off-chance I had a meal, I would put how much I *wanted* on my plate then get rid of a quarter. Then, at the end I would have to throw away either the best part of the dish, or another quarter of the dish. I browsed proana blogs. I was so consumed by it.

That lasted for a while. I don’t even know how long. I ended up recovering by myself. That was about a month ago. It was hard. I couldn’t tell anyone.

Looking back on it, I think there were two main causes for my illness: my friends and my family. Half of my friends have some kind of mental illness, and they’re all severe. I’m the stable one. I felt that if I brought my little “I’m afraid of eating” to them it would probably seem like an exaggeration. 

My family, especially my mom, is really toxic about weight. We were all overweight except for one of my sisters, who struggles with weight gain. My mom always compares us to her. She’s always on some kind of diet and is always projecting her unhappiness on us. I remember when I was in the height of my disorder, she bought a shirt for me and when I tried it on she said “Wow, you really are fatter than your sister, huh?” I was the thinnest I had ever been. All my sisters repeatedly try and fail to starve themselves to lose weight. My brother is 13 and after comments from my mother started eating less than 800 calories a day. He’s 6’0. Even my skinny sister has recently been dieting. 

I’ve been in self-recovery for about three months. Some days are harder than others. I’ve gained a lot of the weight back. I’m not overweight anymore, but I feel like I’m always on the edge of a relapse. When I feel my thighs brush together while walking , a wave of disgust hits me. The smell of Gain laundry detergent still triggers me because I used to use it to mask the smell of my mom cooking so I wouldn’t be hungry.

My mom still comments on my weight. I feel like no matter what the scale reads I won’t be enough for her. She called my legs fat the other day. If I eat too much she’ll tell me “Wow, that’s a lot. I thought you were dieting...” referring to the days I wouldn’t come down for dinner because I was too busy crying over photoshopped pictures.

The worse part is I loved myself more when I was anorexic. My stomach was flatter, my legs were thinner, and I just felt skinnier. The feeling of my clothes slowly getting looser on me was ecstasy. Every time I eat I feel like a pig. I’m *this* close to a relapse. I know I shouldn’t, but I really want to.

1397,1397,eating_disorders,"I'm 21 years old trans man (pre hrt, pre surgery) and I have been struggling to eat regularly for years.

It started when I was in secondary school (around 15-16) I would not eat breakfast or lunch and would snack until I got home or wouldn't eat until dinner. I never thought of it as me being conscious of my weight because I've always wanted to gain weight but found wanting to eat hard. 

Later on it turnt into a form of self harm. Intrusive thoughts would tell me that I didn't deserve to eat. The hunger pain became normal for me and I started to enjoy it. But I would be upset and self conscious that I would lose weight. This was around when I was 17 - 18.

Since then intrusive thoughts haven't been as bad but I just don't eat. I have 1 meal a day and most of the time barely finish it. 

I've tried to get myself organised and have meal plans but they don't stick. I will make food and end up having a little bit. I find it easier to eat out with others because I don't like to seem like I don't eat. I've tried to research about not wanting to eat and how to get the desire to eat back but I find myself confused by what I find. I don't think I have a eating disorder.

So before I explain my ‘problem’, I wanna give you some background information: I am a 18 year old female, 5’3 (161 cm) and 114 lb (52 kg), which is not under- and DEFINITELY not overweight. I don’t have a ‘toxic’ relationship with food and I don’t have a history with an ED, but I have been very self conscious since I was a literal child, like 8 years old. 

I’ve noticed that, especially since the lockdown, I have been eating VERY little, but not on purpose, I’m just... not hungry? I eat breakfast, skip lunch and eat dinner at night + maybe a piece of fruit in the evening and that’s literally it. I counted calories last week and turns out I’ve been eating under 800 calories a day for WEEKS now and it scared me because I know I need so much more, at least 2000. 
I have been 114 lb for a year now and I’ve been 5’3 for 1.5 years so I think that’s the reason I haven’t really been noticing my ‘dangerous’ eating habits. Right now I feel fine, but I am afraid this is gonna result in me (unconsciously) developing an ED (given the fact that I’ve been very insecure and self conscious since I was 8) or that it’s gonna damage my body and its functions in the future.

1408,1408,eating_disorders,"Every time I confided in someone about my eating disorder, they immediately wanted to know if it was a control issue or a weight issue. But it wasn’t that at all.
I had 2 jobs, was a full time student, and had just started a company. One of my jobs was night shift, 10pm-3pm, the other was mornings around 9-3. I had a full course load and literally every moment I wasn’t working or in class I was doing research, emailing people, making product, and coming up with new ideas. I would get home from my night shift and work on my business until 7 am, then would start getting ready for my other job. I’d sleep a little after that, then go back to working. My school days were back to back classes for 8 straight hours, I would do my homework for one class while sitting in another. If I didn’t have homework to do during class, I would start working on my business again. If I was with my friends, I was cutting materials, sketching designs, discussing possibilities while we sat and smoked a bowl. My friends said I was the highest functioning stoner they’d ever seen. My sleep schedule was destroyed, which in turn screwed up my eating schedule. I was stressed and exhausted and felt like crap at all times.
It started with my stress and busy schedule simply forgetting to eat or just not having time. Eventually I would get to a point of hunger where eating would actually make me nauseous. I lost 25 pounds in about a month.

I recognized the problem early but honestly didn’t think it was worth my energy to try to fix it. I felt that the most valuable thing I could do with my energy was work on my business. It was something that hadn’t been done before, would legitimately help the environment, and would raise a lot of awareness for issues. Everyone was praising me and supporting me for it so I felt that’s what I should focus all of my free energy on. I felt like it was the most valuable part about me.

I was legitimately too exhausted to make food, or go and get food. I ordered delivery often because it meant I would have more time to work, but eating fast food makes me sick because of intolerances I have to preservatives and artificial flavors. Plus, stress made it uncomfortable to eat. Eating was physically painful and nauseating at this point because of how bad my disorder had gotten.
And it only got worse, because I wasn’t eating, I had no energy.
I would sit in bed thinking about how badly I wanted to feel healthy again, and thinking about my hunger. I often didn’t have enough energy to get out of bed, let alone make a full meal or go drive to get food. I was too weak to stand sometimes because it had been days since I had eaten. I felt pathetic honestly. I remember thinking that if I died, then maybe my project would get the attention and funding it needed to get made. Most artists don’t find fame until they’re dead, was my mentality. It didn’t occur to me that if I was dead, my project wouldn’t happen because I wasn’t there to create it.

The tipping point was when my mom came to see me. She gave me a hug and I felt her arms wrap around me so easily, like there was nothing there. She pulled back and she looked so sad. She worked so hard to make me, all those years and all that work, and I was throwing it all away.

I’ll be honest, I didn’t feel like I was worth getting better for. My depression was awful, I had full body stress hives, and I felt like I was a failure for not getting an impossibly huge project done in an incredibly unrealistic time frame. I was having severe panic attacks several times a day.

I got better for my mom at first. She brought me to doctors appointments, made me food, and held me through my panic attacks. I could tell it broke her heart to see me like that.

But most of all, she made me feel worth saving.
I never want to feel like that again, but more than anything, I never want my mom to feel that way again. I can’t believe I was so selfish to not think of how the people around me felt seeing me destroy myself like that.

That was over a year ago. My cheeks are fat, my skin is clear, and I love myself again. I feel strong again, and I’m grateful for my beautiful body and mind. I’m taking my time on this project, and I’m taking care of myself, because I know that I’m the only one who can get it done.

The people in my life worked hard to make me who I am today, so I’m working hard to make sure their efforts aren’t in vain.",,My eating disorder developed from severe exhaustion,10,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,h7yb6w,1,[deleted],,/r/eating_disorders/comments/h7yb6w/my_eating_disorder_developed_from_severe/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/h7yb6w/my_eating_disorder_developed_from_severe/,1592013717,847,0,0,0,-1,1,Stressful schedule and busy lifestyle leading to lack of time and energy for eating,harmful,"Developed an eating disorder due to lack of time and energy for eating, Lost 25 pounds in a month, Eating became physically painful and nauseating, Had severe panic attacks and full-body stress hives","Stressful lifestyle due to having 2 jobs, being a full-time student, and starting a company",harmful,"Forgot to eat or didn’t have time to eat due to busy schedule, Lost 25 pounds in a month, Developed an eating disorder due to stress and exhaustion, Eating became physically painful and nauseating, Had no energy due to not eating, Had severe depression, panic attacks, and full-body stress hives","Stress from work and school, busy schedule, lack of time to eat, nausea from stress and lack of food",harmful,"Lost 25 pounds in a month due to stress and lack of time to eat, Disordered eating habits developed due to stress and exhaustion, Eating became physically painful and nauseating due to the severity of the eating disorder, Depression, full body stress hives, and severe panic attacks developed as a result of the eating disorder"

1413,1413,eating_disorders,"I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with food for quite a while now. When I was going to school, I used to skip meals during the day and only eat when I got home in the hope to lose weight. But since the lockdown began and I’ve been at home 24/7 I’ve been forced to eat 3 meals a day (as my parents wouldn’t let me skip). I was already underweight but as I started eating more I started gaining weight. I became really unhappy with my appearance (even though I was still classed as underweight) and so I started trying to be healthier. I started eating less and exercising more. But I still wasn’t satisfied. I started weighing myself regularly and restricting my calories and I wasn’t happy unless I had lost weight. As well as this, I only exercised to compensate for the food I had eaten, not for the actual health benefits. I feel like my mind is constantly consumed with food and calories and it’s making it hard to enjoy the foods I used to love. A few days ago, I calculated my bmi (which I know isn’t always accurate) and it said I am severely underweight. I know that the weight I am at the moment isn’t healthy but I’m really scared to recover. I know that I need to gain weight to get better but a small part of me doesn’t want to. I feel like I’m no longer in control and even if I wanted to stop, I couldn’t.

1419,1419,eating_disorders,"I developed an ED in college and struggled with it for about 5 years.  At one point, I thought recovery from my eating disorder was impossible.  I literally could not imagine a world where I could eat normally.  It was like I was stuck in a game of Jumanji, where I didn't want to play anymore, but had no choice but to.

Then things slowly turned a head; my life got better, I found more meaning, and the ED just didn't have the same siren call.  Tracking calories and restricting just seemed like a pointless chore.   I was resolute I would never relapse.  There just was no appeal.

And ...  now here I am, back.   I am in the epicenter of the virus (NYC); my relationship ended and left me heartbroken; WFH as a software dev is deeply isolating, as I literally just silently stare at code all day;  my office, which provided a critical social network, is closed at *least* until fall.  My world has shattered.

There is nowhere for me to go.  I stare into 300 square feet of lonely apartment space.  There is nothing I can do in my life to move forward; everything is closed, everyone is self-isolating.  No new hobbies I can pick up, no one I can have a face-to-face conversation with, no places I can travel, \*nothing\* I can do except sit in a tiny studio apartment alone and descend further into depression.  I don't even want to go out to get food, or order it in, because that involves seeing people in masks and a reminder of just how fucked the world is.  I have no desire to eat anyway.  I'm so depressed.

The only thing that now brings me joy is withering away to nothing.  It's something I can control!   I can't reopen the world; I *can* eat less.  Stepping on the scale to see my progress is something I really look forward to.  The idea of setting more underweight ""goals"" excites me.  Not because I want to be thin, or think I am fat.  I just want to make forward progress in life on *something*.

There's no end game.  I really like running, biking, hiking--restricting will eventually render me incapable of doing those things.  I will damage my body.  I already know how hard it is to recover.

This past year I’ve been dealing with a lot of stress from exams, some toxic friends etc and took it out on myself. I was overly into exercise, particularly running where I damaged my knees, had shin splints and pulled a muscle in my thighs now and then. I was losing weight and I hated how I looked but I also couldn’t bring myself to eat. I went to boarding school and would eat my lunch alone in my room and throw most of it away.

1431,1431,eating_disorders,"I’ve been recovering from AN sort of up and down (with the help of an excellent outpatient ED clinic) for the past four years. I’ve been at a stable point in my recovery for quite a while now, maybe one and a half years completely symptom free. I’ve slowly gained up until this point, and after a recent minor weight gain, I realized I’m back at my pre-disorder body size (if not a tiny bit larger). 

This realization sickens me. In the past few years while I was at slightly lower weights, I found that I could at least take comfort that I wasn’t at my HW and still had a somewhat slim, or at least average body size. Now I am above average in weight for my height, which appears to be my body’s happy place (as it was my healthy pre disorder weight). I’m feeling that the small amount of positives recovery gave me do not come close to the negatives I’m experiencing in returning to this body size - namely the disgust I have for my self and body. 

Ideally I want to push through and not lose all the weight I worked so hard to regain. I seem to be stuck, and my therapist and I are kind of at a roadblock in trying to figure out how to help me with this. I guess the idea is that as one recovers and weight restores, your brain catches up with your body size eventually and the feelings of disgust are supposed to kind of plateau or decrease, but this isn’t the case for me. 

What am I doing wrong? Do I just have to sit with my self-hate forever until it’s maybe not there someday?

So I’ve been having negative feelings about my weight and body as long as I can remember. I started starving myself in 3rd grade because I was bigger than my skinny friends. This came an odd habit that I couldn’t stop. I finally told my school councelor in 4th grade and they didn’t take me seriously.

And now I’ve been struggling again, but with different kind of problem. I don’t know if this is a normal thing or something. I just want to ask. 
So at 2019 January I started to skip many meals and I only ate once a day. I lost many kilos, but nobody cared. In June I came obsessed with training and went to gym 7times a week. I started to eat more but way too healthy. This lasted about half years. Then I started to eat way more because I wanted to stop the empty feeling inside of me by eating. I gained back to my healthy weight (130pounds, about 58kg)
Now I’m at this circle where I starve myself and then binge. And I hate it. I can’t stop but I just feel like I can’t let it go.

I believe the environment I grew up in fostered my disordered thoughts. My dad was 400lbs at the beginning of my life and he wanted to make sure I would not struggle with weight like he did. But, this caused my mom to hide giving me milk as a child; receiving dirty looks from my dad if I were to get a slice of cake at a birthday party; and feeling the need to hide food so that it wouldn’t get thrown away because it was “unhealthy.” This is just a small look into what I believe added to my disordered thoughts. 
Its been 4 years since I was at my healthy weight. The pounds just add on and on. I can’t keep up the exercise regimen I had in high school. I did cross country and swim which consisted of running 8 miles almost every day. In swim season we would swim about 2 miles everyday. I also ate close to perfection. No junk food and limited my carb intake. However, In this stage of my life I just do not have the time to keep up with such a strict regimen. But, what’s frustrating to me is that I know for me to reach my goal weight it takes that much dedication. I cannot “cheat” at all. So now, 40 lbs heavier, I feel so defeated. I don’t know what to do because I feel like working out or trying to eat healthier just doesn’t have an effect on my body.

I purge upto 10 times a day but I don't need to force it so don't damage throat, however my teeth have been eaten away by the acid.

1456,1456,eating_disorders,"Hey everyone,

I must say I am really worried about my gradual but now sudden weight loss that keeps dropping.

So basically I came off antidepressants last December and they made me gain quite a lot of weight. They made me end up weighing 57 kg (I think that's like 125 pounds or something?) but keep in mind I am only 5'3 tall and female. So when I came off them I gradually started to loose weight and I actually didn't really notice it at all. I was definitely eating less because I was not as hungry as I was on antidepressants (they made me feel constantly hungry all the time). It was not until about 2 months ago probably around April that the weight started coming off even more and when I started to weigh myself very often. When is started to loose quite a bit of weight I was really happy. I am also at university full time so I am very stressed and already depressed. I will admit that I have started to get overly obsessive with calorie intake and check how much calories most things I eat have and have reduced my portions substantially. I am always thinking about food and my next meal which is debilitating. I worry about like how many calories in fruit and pretty much everything. I am afraid that i'm starting to get scared of food. I want to exercise but I don't think I eat enough so I would feel dizzy and I get migraines so that wouldn't help and had this fear that I would have to eat more if I exercise which is so ridiculous I know. I now weigh 49.7 kg (I think 105 pounds?) and yesterday I weighed 50.2 I don't know why the weight keeps coming off because I think i'm still eating the same as I did which is really strange and quite concerning. I think when I started to weigh my self more frequently (now every day) I get more restrictive with what I eat. I actually increased my portion for breakfast a bit yesterday but it made me feel sick. When I started to restrict my diet I felt hungry all the time but now I don't even want food, I feel like im forcing food down me. I feel really tired everyday and can hardly concentrate when doing uni work. I am very health anxious and keep thinking  what if I have a disease like cancer or something wrong with me that is causing all this weight loss. Thats really freaking me out. Should I call a doctor and get a blood test? Sorry for all these questions.

Any help or suggestions will be so appreciated!

I was wary to post here, as i’ve had bad luck with Eating Disorder communities in the past, but after reading through the wall a bit I feel like it’ll be okay.

Lately i’ve really been struggling to follow through with my meal plan. I just feel like me making it a priority is glutinous and selfish.
 
I feel like I need to be with friends rather than eat and every time I eat I HAVE to go and exercise.

I've lost 25kg in 3 months eating 500 calories per day and rarely binging, everyone was so proud of me and happy of how thin I looked.  
My life started to become a mess after my parents have a serious discussion last month, I went to the kitchen to have a sandwich and it was my mother birthday party, she discussed with my father and he hitted her in front of all the guests. I got completely numb at that moment, forgot the sandwich and started crying and shaking, the rest of the day became a complete binge disaster with at least five sandwichs eaten and plenty of sweets. After that day I've lost control over everything and started eating even more for weeks, recently I've gotten to a normal diet with around 1200 calories per day and I feel fat as hell.

1463,1463,eating_disorders,"TW I think, I'm just gonna be honest about how I feel. I'm gonna block out parts that might really hurt some. :)

Tl;dr upfront: I've suspected I might have a problem with eating and food for a bit but I can never pinpoint if it was bad enough to bring up with my therapist/doctor.

When I was around 8 up until I was about 12, I was teased about my size by both girls and boys. I always noticed I was a little bigger around the stomach than most of the other kids. I would grab my stomach and see &gt;!how much I had to lose to have a flat tummy!&lt;. I loathed &gt;!being weighed !&lt;as well. 

To ""cope"", I made a deal with myself. That deal was: &gt;!you only eat when you're hungry; if you're not hungry, don't eat.!&lt; I kept that promise but I was a kid; &gt;!kids are often hungry.!&lt;

Around age 12 or 13, things got worse. I used to lie in bed at night and dream about&gt;! using a knife to cut off all the ""excess"" fat on my stomach so I could finally be skinny. !&lt;

I knew those thoughts were bad, so I ignored them and moved on. 

My eating habits, however...

I've unconsciously been keeping that promise to myself for years. In the past year, I &gt;!haven't been hungry as often, so I haven't been eating.!&lt; First it was &gt;!skipping breakfast!&lt;, and then it was &gt;!skipping lunch!&lt; as well. My mother and boyfriend started getting a little concerned. I couldn't lie to my boyfriend, so I told him I just wasn't hungry. But with my mom, I started &gt;!throwing away my lunch everyday so she thought I ate.!&lt;

Eventually, I got used to being hungry and began &gt;!not eating even when I was hungry!&lt;. It took me being in &gt;!physical pain to eat.!&lt; 

I was like that for almost 2 months. 

Now, I'm a little better with food- I still &gt;!hate my body and hate being weighed!&lt;, but at least I'm eating semi-regularly (&gt;!skipping lunch or breakfast, never both!&lt;) and have even gotten myself to eat 3 meals a day sometimes. However, I still get these ""moods"" where I loathe food and refuse to even think about eating. Sometimes these moods spring up while I'm eating, which forces me to &gt;!force-feed myself and try to not choke on my food!&lt;. Sometimes they spring up when I'm just getting hungry and I &gt;!feel guilty about being hungry!&lt;. 

I've suspected I might have a problem for a bit but I can never pinpoint if it was bad enough to bring up with my therapist/doctor.

1478,1478,eating_disorders,"I(19F) went to college and had a great time. I had a boyfriend, found friends who didn’t hate me, and overall did well. But when I came home from break, my whole family noticed the infamous freshman 15 I was a victim of.

I was always a bigger girl, super picky, but I was overweight my whole life. I ate pure junk food, fast food, whatever. My parents both worked and were separated my whole life so a lot of the food I ate was on the go. When my mom cooked for me, I never wanted it. People would come over and swoon over her home cooked meals, but I’d go on hunger strikes until we got McDonald’s. I got teased, sure, but I never cared though! I loved my weight and my body!  Sometimes I would look at myself in the mirror and pinch my fat but I was smart enough growing up to love my body because, at the end of the day, I hated to exercise and didn’t wanna try new foods, so I lived with it. 

When I came home from my first year of college though, all the snide comments about how I gained weight made me notice how “bad” my weight gain was and it fucked me up. I started working out and fell into a terrible depressive episode. My ex and I had a swift, mutual break up after I came out of the hospital for attempting suicide. A few weeks later, he’s dating his much prettier, sweeter, younger, skinnier girl best friend he told me not to worry about.

This REALLY fucked me up. I realized that I didn’t want to kill myself and, being the spiteful girl I am, dedicated my summer to losing weight just to show everybody that I could. It was then that my cousin put me on to the free Planet Fitness membership for kids under 18.

Unfortunately, this is where I think my ED (or whatever I have) started. I would wake up, go to the gym, smoke a cigarette, then go to the mall, grab some food there, and go home. Not so bad, other than picking up smoking tobacco after spending freshman semester preaching to my friends about how bad nicotine was. 

I would smoke weed at home and get munchies. For some reason, even though growing up and KNOWING all the dangers and signs of disordered thoughts/eating, I started to vomit my food after eating it. I would feel nauseous if I ate too much and run to the bathroom in the basement so no one would hear me. I kept it to myself and hid it VERY well from my mom and everyone else. My best friend I met in college is super skinny, naturally. She had some hormonal issues growing up that stunted her growth and she grew up with parents who were together and kept her active. I looked up to her, but I never compared myself to her. Still, I think I started to look at her and think “damn, I wish I could be that little.” She would NEVER encourage this stuff if she knew how deep it goes.

But the one person who noticed was my best friend from high school. She confronted me several times about getting help and I pushed her away to the point that I don’t think our friendship has ever been the same. We used to speak openly to one another about our depression and my bipolar disorder and her health issues, but now we always skirt around those topics. 

Flash forward to now. A few days ago, after a stint of purging, I had this sharp pain in my chest that had me stumbling around my room. Felt like I was having a heart attack until it disappeared. I’ve started feeling cold in my house even when I’m bundled up and layered. I started waking up and checking myself in the mirror. I tell myself that I’m mindful about my eating, but I noticed that I go longer without eating than I used to. 

It’s odd to me because I don’t think I’ve really changed how I ate because I LOVE to eat, but if I’m being honest with myself, I have a really unhealthy relationship with food. I used to eat french fries every day, now I have to force myself to eat some so that I can remind myself that I CAN eat that shit in moderation and I don’t need to puke it up. I’ve been really good about stopping myself before I get too full, but I only really eat like one meal a day with a bunch of snacks here and there. I try not to purge, but it still happens every now and then when mentally I’m not doing too hot.

Anyways, I wanna post here because I already have A LOT of issues. I know that being bipolar makes me a lot more likely to develop an eating disorder, but I think I’ve fought getting help for so long because I was scared of having ANOTHER mental illness to my life. But when I look at myself now, I’m so upset because I feel like I went through so fucking much and I still can’t stop finding things about myself to be unhappy with. I love the weight I’m at now, but the more I reflect on it, the more I realize that I have a problem. I finally admitted to my mom what was happening and broke down. She hugged me and started crying too, telling me how she was so sorry she didn’t noticed and that she felt awful for ever making me feel that way.

What really broke me is what she said when she pulled away. She gestured to my self harm scars (almost a year clean now) and said “if you can overcome that, you can get through this too.”

So point is, I am getting help but I’m still so scared. Scared of gaining weight again, but also scared that this will kill me. Please, if anyone is reading my story and can relate, how did you go through your journey of recovery? I have had so many friends who had eating disorders, but that was before we were friends and I never felt the need to bring it up. I’ve shown compassion for my friends for YEARS when they went through their own issues with their weight. How comes I can’t show myself the same love? And for anyone else who may be ok this thread because you’re struggling, or maybe you think “this CAN’T be happening to me”, please take care of yourself. Don’t make the mistake I did and make excuses for yourself.",,Anyone can relate? How did you overcome? Are you still struggling? This is my story.

1481,1481,eating_disorders,"I have a weird history with my body. I've always been a healthy active one in my family for 11 years old. I would do martial arts, and when I got bored with it, I kept a workout routine at home. From then it was to the gym, where I wanted to try bodybuilding. At 5'4 I had no problem eating 2500 calories. Then, I had a more prevalent seasonal depression, and in my depressed season, I fell out of my routine from about August to January 2019. I felt fat, but I was always a healthy weight. I even purged here and there, and back then i solved my feelings by overeating. But once the clouds cleared, I got back into working out, doing yoga, eating healthy, etc. I wasn't perfect, and struggled with consistency, but still.

I went out of the country for a month to Brazil to see my grandparents, where I ate crap and didn't work out for a month, and upon coming home, I was out of shape for the first time in my life. I was never fat, but I was at the highest part of the spectrum of what was healthy for me, about 130 pounds. I tried to lose it a healthy way, but the onset of seasonal depression left me struggling with consistency, and eventually sedentary. I reasoned with myself, ""ok, I'll starve until I'm skinny, but then go back to building muscle with a good lean foundation, right?""

Well, it's not easy to starve yourself. Until you get diagnosed with ADD and prescribed Adderall that kills your appetite. I love the medication because it helps a lot with my ADD, but I was also very excited to have this appetite suppressant at my hands every day. Fast forward to now, about 4 months after my diagnosis, I am 114. (I think) If I lose one more pound I'm underweight.

Throughout this whole story, I have never truly felt self insecure. I would speak negatively to myself looking at the mirror when I was out of shape, watch my stomach shake when I poked it, and jumped. I was convinced I was fat. But at the same time, it never was a SUPER big deal. I do and have always understood I'm a conventionally attractive person. (not a narcissist I promise lol) I have a pretty face and cool fashion, and also an intelligent girl! But now when I wake up in the morning I love it, to see my waist and whatnot. 

I just recently looked at old photos of me. It wasn't a giant change in my body but a substantial one. I miss my body... it was healthy and full of life. I love my body now too but when you consider what I did to get here, it's a bit dangerous. But in my other photos, there is some unexplainable aura, a healthier one, even if I didn't eat healthy or workout. Just, more full, pinker in my face, a smile that radiates more. My breasts have gotten so much smaller, my legs and butt too. Things don't fit the same, which can be a good or bad thing depending on the article of clothing.

The standard of beauty is a big butt, big boobs, small waist. I can either have the waist, or the boobs and butt. I can't do both at the same time. And now, I just want to keep going just a bit longer, just a little more skinny, and then I'll find a happy medium! But I can't stop for some reason. And I know if I could snap my finger and have my old body back, I'd regret it. Maybe it isn't exactly about the body, but what is it about then?

1484,1484,eating_disorders,"hi. glad i discovered this group i  guess. so, nobody knows about my eating disorder except for this one friend whom i share everything with her. my ED story... it all started when i finished my high school education, and i had to stay home for few months until i got accepted to college. so it was like 4 years ago. i LOVED food i could eat anything without a single care in the world. i'd eat late night (carbs not healthy ones) and i was so happy back then with my friends (boarding school for 5 years). my happiness and affection towards food had all gone the second i got home. everyone especially my parents kept telling me how much ive put on weight. at first, i wasnt bothered about it at all. but then one day, my inside voices kept telling me to lose some weight then slowly it led to insecurity. i hated my body i wanted what my sisters had (model-type kinda body). and then one day i woke up, i didnt want to eat. i suddenly count the amount of calories that i'll be eating that day. when i got accepted to my college, i havent had a single carbs. i would only had 100 calories a day. until i got tired of starving myself on a scorching hot day. i proceeded to have a proper meal (so-called haha!). but theres a voice in my head that will always creep on me. ""OH NO THAT FOOD WILL MAKE YOU FAT YOU NEED TO THROW UP"". so since then, whenever i eat, i'd purge them all out to make myself feel better. im not 158cm and 46 kg. everytime i put on even 2 kg's, i'd beat myself up and starve myself.

1485,1485,eating_disorders,"Okay I just want to note: I don’t regularly make myself throw up. It’s *never* something I plan to do, and I usually only do it in the moment if I eat something like a meal and I feel guilty afterwards. So it’s not a regular occurrence or anything for me and I try to avoid it.

Anyways, I fasted for a little over two days and decided that I could eat a bit today. I got a kid’s size pasta bowl from a local all natural vegan restaurant, and ate half of the (really big) piece of focaccia bread that came with it. It probably wasn’t even that high in calories—it was a “kid’s size” and it was from a “healthy” restaurant. 

But after I ate it I just felt so guilty and disgusted with myself and I made myself throw it up, even though I really was not planning on it. And now I just feel shaky and dizzy and lightheaded. Usually I don’t feel like this after I do that, so I’m just wondering what I could do to feel better?

1488,1488,eating_disorders,"(This is kinda like a diary entry for me. I just wanted to get all of this out. It’s annoying to keep it bottled up and feeling like no one in my life understands. There are probably spelling mistakes, I didn’t proof read if. I don’t want to read it. It’s 6 AM, I haven’t been to sleep and I just needed this out of my head asap.)  

You can skip this if you want. I just really want to explain how this happened but I have no interest in telling people I know irl about it because I’m afraid of giving tips or tempting someone to fall down this hole. I’m going to keep the specifics to myself because I still don’t want to offer tips to anyone. But I’m assuming a lot of people in this subreddit have gone through similar experiences so it’s okay for me to speak freely. 


Basically what happened was I 
 (F17 at the time) moved in my with sister for a bit. My sister and her roommate weren’t on the best terms in regard to finances. So my sister wouldn’t buy groceries for the house because the roommate would benefit from it without paying for anything herself. So instead we ate meal to meal. My sister would bring home fast food and food from the restaurant she worked at regular. On top of food she would always made sure I had one sweet candy, one chocolate type candy, a bag of ships and soda. Everyday. 

As you can imagine I gained so much weight. I didn’t notice how much I gained until a few months later I moved back in with my mom. I started getting heart burn and I definitely had a stomach ulcer because all the chips my sister bought were typically hot ones. So everyday I was eating hot chips. 

I decided for the sake of my health and how I was feeling, I wanted to change my diet. I started eating healthier. Just making conscious efforts to be more nutritious nothing crazy. I noticed within a month I dropped around 15 pounds. I wasn’t restricting, working out or anything. Just changed the way I ate. So then I decided that I loved the way weight loss looked on me and wanted to actually give it a try. I’ve had issues with my body my entire life, so for once I was doing something about it and I felt great. 


I started watching YouTube videos and learning about weight loss. I was very adamant on not wanting to calorie count. I didn’t want eating to become something I felt guilty of. (Foreshadowing. And man, If only I knew what I know now.) so I didn’t calorie count. I started working out and running a mile on the treadmill every day. I started cutting out red meat, gluten and dairy. 

Another foreshadowing moment is because I was watching weight loss videos on YouTube I started being suggested peoples restricting diaries they uploaded. I remember looking at these videos disgusted and unsettled that YouTube would allow such sad and dark content.

Eventually I started calorie counting 1300 daily. I did this because most of the YouTube videos were saying to lose weight I HAD to be in a calorie deficit. So I told myself I was allowed to calorie count but not do it so seriously. If I over eat slightly oh well- it was just a target area to reach. But as you could imagine that didn’t stop the slight guilt I felt whenever I did eat past my 1300 calories. 

I was so excited at first for working out but eventually that changed. I started getting anxiety whenever I would lay down to go to sleep because I knew the first thing I did in the morning was work out. I HATED working out. I hated it so much. I was motivated for a solid week before it became a chore. I was getting panic attacks every night over it. 

What ended up happened around this time was my mom was in between grocery shopping. I was on a gluten free, dairy free, red meat free diet. So I ate very specific things. At the time I had no food at all that I could eat besides grapes, black beans and eggs. So I started accidentally restricting. I was eating 700 calories a day because i didn’t have food. I was obviously keeping track. I didn’t realize I was actually starving myself until I noticed I was losing weight. And I LOVED the way I looked. Well, less about the way u looked- I loved the weight loss progress I was making at such a quick rate. I had spent the last 6 months of my life having panic attacks over working out and THIS was how I started seeing the results I desperately wanted. 

So I told myself I’d stop restricting once I got to the weight loss goal. One that I’ve never met and probably never will. I don’t know if a perfect version of myself even exists anymore. I eventually started finding comfort and enabling in those YouTube videos I mentioned before. The SAME videos I was disgusted by became my best friend. It made me not feel alone and it intrigued me to see how people struggled like me and how they dealt with it. 

My sister who bullied me my entire life about my weight saw me for the first time in months around when I first developed my ED. She told me she was *proud* of my weight loss. I wanted to cry because she didn’t get it. She doesn’t get it. She doesn’t get that to look and maintain the way I do now I have to starve myself.  As much as I hated this comment she made it only enabled me more. It’s something I still think back to and “motivates” me.





I’m going to add a list I made a while back because I’ve always wanted to share it but I obviously don’t want to publicly advertise I have an ED and the only place I can share it is here. So


Ways my ed has effected me:

- I have insomnia regularly 

- my periods have gone down from 5 days to 2 days long. 

- I wasn’t suicidal and I didn’t have regular depressive episodes before my ed but now I cry a lot and I want to die. I was on a really strong self love journey that is completely gone now. 

- I was really into modeling/ photography. I haven’t picked my camera up in months. My Instagram account, which used to be my joy, has been neglected for nearly a year now. 

- I look in the mirror and only see what’s wrong.

I'm too stubborn to reach out to my mom for help because she'll just make me come home. I don't want to lose the independence I have, but I'm also really scared. I feel anorexia creeping up on me. The worst part is that each day I'm stuck in quarantine brings more and more proana thoughts. All I want to do is lose weight, but the logical part of me remembers my suffering before recovery.

1501,1501,eating_disorders,"I struggled alot with my weight and disordered eating/bulimia from the ages of 12/13/14, and depression since Inwas around 8, But then I thought I got better, I started to talk about it and I genuinely stopped throwing up after meals, and ate everyday. I thought I was getting ""better"" and for a time I truly believed I was! 

I was about 76ish kgs (I will admit ive always been heavy no matter how much fat i actually loose, and thats made me feel horrible some days, even when I hot compliments on how ""healthy"" and slim I looked) and I was pretty steady at that weight staying around 76-78 pretty much all year, and I was pretty okay with that. And then I met my current boyfriend of 8 months, and since then ive started taking depo as birth control. but i do love him, and hes amazing! really is, but back in February, his mother passed by her own hand which I don't really want to talk about. (Which I do feel selfish for feeling sad about as I'd only known her for about 5 or 6 months) And that started a pretty large bout of depression, which I genuinely did try to get therapy for, and then Covid showed up. The mix of depression and bingeing has made me gain alot of weight. I weigh 86 kgs now! im only 5'5! and Im trying my best to lose weight healthily, but what ive realized now is how obsessed my mother is with pointing out how much weight ive gained. every day Im forced to go near her as were stuck in quarantine alone, in a tiny house. I feel like one of her main hobbys is making me feel like shit in general right now, i do love her but everything she says really does hurt, though to her if i say anything im just overreacting and being a wuss. 

I also had a nurse's appointment today, for my depo shot, and my whole experience there has made me feel so bad. Ive made myself throw up tonight for the first time in almost a year and I feel horrible. First I had to be weighed, which is fine, its procedure i get that, but I asked her if it was okay that I didnt look at the number, as ive delt with disordered eating in the past. her response? ""Oh it doesnt really matter anyways. Can you read it out to me please?"" I guess i was in the wrong here but I complied. She then proceeded to give me quite a harsh talking to about how much weight ive gained, and then reprimanded me for it, because ""whoever youre taking birth control for won't want you if you keep gaining weight like this."" I have to get it every 10 weeks. ive gained a total of 2kgs in over 2 months. she went on and on until I was out the door, and I must say im very thankful for all the Covid-19 precautions, as I was in and out in about 10 minutes, where it can usually take 30+ (with waiting after the injection). I guess I just can't believe some of the stuff she said in there + all the stuff from my mother + myself unfortunately. I just feel like shit and I needed to get it out in a place where I hopefully won't be judged. If you read this far thank you, and I hope youre doing amazing.

1510,1510,eating_disorders,"Hi all; forgive me if there aren't proper additional tw/cw on here. I had struggled with AN (restricting then b/p subtype) for over 10 years. I started recovering from AN b/p subtype about 2 years ago, but didn't get more serious about my recovery (i.e. stopping purging all together cold turkey) until early Dec. 2018. I have been behavior free for well over a year now and my health/vitals are all good again. As a part of my recovery, once I hit a weight that was 'scary' for me (healthy bmi cutoff) I knew it would be best to stop weighing myself all together. That was about 15 months ago (Jan 2018). Yesterday, after a lot of stress during quarantine and feeling ok with how I look/feel I thought 'why not just see' and weigh myself. In my head, I kept feeling like it would 'be fine' or that 'i probably weigh x since my clothes are the same size'.  I now feel emotionally and physically  horrible. I feel as if my body is covered in bruises. I've spent the last two days crying. While I have basically maintained weight for these 15 months and am a slim/normal bmi of 19, I weigh a bit more than I thought I would and feel like a failure for not wanting to start losing weight again. I feel like recovery was also for nothing, since I don't feel like I can accept myself at this size even though I was totally happy with it just days before weighing myself. Nothing about me has changed but I feel so much bigger.  I know all of these thoughts are illogical and my ed and have been trying to fight them, and even was able to eat a normal amount for myself yesterday and avoid any behaviors.

there is someone i know who has started to use ED behaviours. they have also started talking to me about it, giving me details about everything and saying all sorts of triggering and negative things. this has ended up in me getting very very triggered and i want to help them and be there for them but i dont know what to do, i cant be an asshole and tell them they're triggering me and i dont know if they're talking to anyone else about it as well, so i dont want to risk making them bottle it all in and/or do something bad.

I've been in recovery with a few minor relapses from anorexia and excercise bulimia for almost a decade, but not in therapy for it in a long time. I've been in quarantine since the 15th of last month. Going into quarantine, I purchased a whole months supply of food for us. It did last us a whole month, as we just started running out, so my boyfriend went to the store for us. I sent him a list, but he got everything wrong and now I'm panicking about how I'm going to eat this food.

Some examples of the things that are wrong; he got bone-in skin-on chicken and I gag from the skin due to texture, mixed meat sausages which I don't eat, sugared drinks and I always get sugarfree, sugar added flavored oatmeal where I would normally get plain, and fruit cups in syrup where I would normally get fruit juice or water cups, ect. Even the pot pies are a somehow higher fat and sodium than I would normally pick out. 

I know it's my fault, I should have been more specific with the list, but we have lived together and done our shopping together for 3 years and I have talked about my eating before so I thought he would know a little bit better what to get and go for the stuff we usually purchase. That was my mistake and I'm very grateful for him as I am scared to go out myself.

That being said, I don't want to put us and others at risk further by going out again to get food that I'm more comfy with. I know that even though this food is creepy to me in some ways it's not going to kill me and I have to eat it because it's what we have. I'm very grateful to have food at all. 

I've never been good at making myself eat food I'm scared of though, especially outside a therapeutic setting, and this could very easily become a relapse, does anyone have any tips or tricks? Advice? How I can feel more in control of my eating even though I can't get the food myself?

When I was 12 I became extremely conscious about my body (i don’t remember a time when I didn’t like my body) and started having problems with food I was not eating or throwing up. My parents took me to a psychologist and a psychiatrist and medicated me.
Then I start suffering from depression and cutting myself.

I was a routing, I wake up have lunch then eat compulsively “take a shower” and throw up. I did that the past 3 weeks with out getting caught but yesterday my mom smell vomit in the bathroom and today she talk to me about it.

I know many and majority of the population think clothing is non-essential but this is severely affecting me at this point. My bras bruise my skin due to trying to tailor them myself to fit. Underwear slip off. I refuse to take off my long winter jacket if I am around people, even indoors, I will only wear an oversized house coat to cover myself from my own eyes when I am home.

I need help..please be kind.. I understand if you think this is non essential but it is essential to my mental health and recovery.

I've suffered from eating disorders for a while. When I was a kid I had binge eating disorder and would find any excuse to eat. In 9th grade I realized how much I weighed and I needed to lose weight so I went full throttle and at only around 600-1000 calories a day and would exercise obsessively, I compulsively counted calories and only ate one thing for breakfast and lunch because I knew exactly how many calories, carbs, sodium, fat, and sugar was in it. I lost my period for 10 months and only recently got it back. I lost 100 pounds in like 9 months and I'm terrified to gain it all back. I've stopped restricting so much since because my mother threatened to send me to the hospital a few times but it was very hard to do and I still have very OCD eating habits from when I was restricting myself and I want to stop. Recently I have been eating more unhealthy foods occasionally and I get very anxious that I am falling back into old binge eating habits and I will exercise compulsively and have the desire to restrict myself. I just want to have a healthy relationship with food and live normally and not be scared to eat certain foods.  How do I stop being so obsessive over food? I think it came from when my parents would constantly tell me I'm not eating enough so I would eat more to make them happy. Eventually I just did it out of habit and the desire to be better.",,I think I'm falling back into old habits.

Hey, so basically I started losing weight about 7 months ago, and lost a lot. I was eating ~1300 calories at most. I went to the doctor eventually and they told me to gain weight, but my mom was very defensive about anyone suggesting i had gotten too skinny. After i lost my period I finally at least tried to gain. I stopped calorie counting and was feeling better. 
When this corona quarantine thing hit I started feeling really down. The calorie counting and restricted eating is back; full throttle. I really need someone to help me stop: to notice what I’m doing is unhealthy. I love my mom more than anything, and I know she’s not a mind reader, I just really wish she would notice. One of her friends gave her ensure and in passing she kind of suggested I take it but I said I’d rather not and she never mentioned it again. I keep telling her I feel fat and don’t want to eat “too much”. But her response is always either “you’re not fat at all” or “don’t worry, we’ll half the recipe that way we don’t have too many brownies (or whatever other food) in the house”. I understand I should just tell her I need help, but it’s really hard and I don’t know what to say.

1534,1534,eating_disorders,"So I have always been anxious around food since I was younger, especially as I am a dancer and do many sports.
 
Recently I have been restricting my food.
It started slow then got to a point where I would even attempt to throw it up after a meal but was never successful.

I limit myself to around 800kcals a day and then workout but I usually dance 3-6 hours a day anyway so it depends. I plan everything I eat days before and it’s the first thing I think of when I get up. I refuse certain foods because they are high in calories.
 
Also I struggle with depression so I stay in bed a lot.
also due to the virus stuff going on My OCD is crazy and makes me anxious so I stay in bed.  I use this to my advantage and stay in bed until it’s 6pm and my parents tell me to eat.
I stay in bed to avoid eating. 
I just drink soooo much water and each day try to cut down my calories.

Someone said it might be a reaction to my depression. I self harm and so they thought it might be due to this but I’m not sure although I have been self harming less since this all started.

I’m just confused. Should I be worried!? Even if I know it’s bad I feel like I probably won’t stop and I feel guilty but I should do it because I’m not pretty.

However with COVID-19 and my parents and myself not being able to work, I was faced with the harsh truth that I would have to move back home. 

Being back home has been the roughest thing I have ever experienced. Everyone in my house-hold mentions how skinny I am (I tend to stay active at school) at least 10 times a day and always say how they're gonna make sure I gain weight while I'm home which is extremely triggering to me. 

At this point honestly I don't even know what I physically look like. My body dysmorphia is at an all time high due to these comments and I find myself constantly fearing and getting anxiety that I would gain weight. 

Back at school, I finally actually started eating when I'm hungry and having an appetite. But at home, I find myself resorting back to skipping most of my meals in the day and having no appetite whatsoever. 

My parents also constantly push food in my face and make me feel guilty for not eating more or always make comments about how little I eat which also makes me have a lot of anxiety and my negative associations with food have returned.

The last few days that I’ve been working near the kitchen, I’ve noticed that she has exactly one (1) small meal between the time she wakes up (late) and the time that we have dinner (~7 pm). So she only has like a cup of yogurt from one dinner to the other. My mom asked if she was feeling alright, because we’re all being super vigilant about our health. She got mad and said “yeah I have a perfect BMI for my height and weight!”, not necessarily understanding that if the measurements that make up your body mass (ie body fat, muscle mass, bone mass) are wack you can still have a “perfect” general ratio. Honestly, this is one behavior in a host of many others that have us all super concerned (we suspect her roommate is controlling and manipulative due to situations we have observed, and even her behavior towards my parents and I with regards to my sister). 

Is this considered disordered eating? If so, what can we do, as a family, to keep her from going further down this road? Right now, she reacts combatively and aggressively to even the smallest show of concern about her wellbeing, so outright communication is all but off the table for now.

1542,1542,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone.  

I've struggled with different eds most of my life. I've had anorexia, bulimia, and struggled with binge eating. I've also struggled with weight gain for the past decade or so. At my biggest I was 220 pounds and I'm only 5'4"". In December of 19 I decided enough was enough I was tired of being fat just wanting to be thin. So I started working out and changing my eating habits. It worked wonders. I'm down 50 pounds since then and it really helped me control the binge habits. 
Now there is a different worry. Am I working out too much?  My plan was to workout 2 to 3 hours a day 5 days a week to help increase my stamina so that in the next few months I can help build our new house and mange the farm my husband and I are building. At first that was fine and I was doing great but now I have to workout for at least an hour or 2 everyday. I know I need rest days but when I try all I can think about is how if I don't do my workout I'll gain all my weight back and then some. And I only get more self abusive the more I try to ignore myself. So I'll workout. It doesn't matter of I'm tired, sore, sick, injured whatever. Even if all I can do is pace the house and stretch I have to be moving because ""moving equals burning calories"". 

I've struggled so much trying to heal myself from the disordered mindset that comes with ED's and I thought I was strong enough to not fall into my old habits but I'm scared I'm gonna sabotage myself.  I just want to be healthy enough to live my dream, but it's like my mind can't accept that. I have to be a ""skinny minnie"" as my father so lovingly put it, or I'm failing. I don't want to make myself sick again but I'm not sure I'll be able to stop myself either.

1552,1552,eating_disorders,"So I moved abroad with my boyfriend After high school (4 years ago). After not liking the country I was in I moved back to the states after a year. And like I said lost the weight after starting to exercise and using MFP. Now I had tendencies when I was about 12-13, of not eating more than 900 kcal a day etc., I remeber crying to my mother about the thoughts I had in my head, but this hadn’t come back until this time when I lost the 40 lbs I had gained while living with my boyfriend. 
So I came back to the states and During this time, I was very stressed out, trying to get As in all my classes in college to get into the program I am currently studying, I only worked and went to school. This is important because I really didn’t have friends, my boyfriend was abroad, and I was extremely lonely. So anyway... after I lost the weight, I got down to 120-125ish I was happy in that range. But I started slowly constantly counting my calories, gaining fear of going over my daily calories, spending 2 hours in the eliptical in the gym before working at the restaurant I worked at at the time. If I ever ate more that I earned I would comensate in the gym or on my treadmill at 4 am the next morning and again go to the gym later that day. This went on for about a year. 
Then I found this specific YouTuber in about September 2018. She had an ED previously or so she claimed. Now she has this eating style where she would deprive about 500 kcal off her sun - fri and then Saturday would eat about 8,000 cal from the weeks worth she’s missed. I fed into this and she convinced me this was a great method. So I did this. I would constantly count and count and count calories, calculate how much I needed to burn, research ways the body burns calories, etc. I was so obsessed. I would go to the store buy about 20 protein bars and then eat them all when I got home, then immediately after, write each ones calories down in a journal. Then I would ensure to subtract them off the next week and only eat 900 kcal the next day.  It’s hard to explain but it was fucking insane. This would happen every. Fucking. Week. (For about 6 months) 
I then got a job later that year as a server and had gotten a Fitbit, so then I got obsessed with my steps. Just for you to understand I would walk 5000 steps on my treadmill downstairs at four am go to work at 7 am, work a full shift on my feet, then go for an about 6000 step walk with my mother at night, that was 30,000 steps all day. And I HAD TO do this everyday. There were no excuses. Or the guilt would haunt me. 
So fast forward this past summer. I went to my country of birth. Me and my boyfriend (no fiancé) were in our final steps of our journey for him to come to the US for us to get married.I was where I wanted to be. 
It vanished. 
I wasn’t counting my calories, I wasn’t really looking at my steps, I was just eating when I felt like it. Walking when I felt like it. I ate healthy, barely craved crap foods that I had previously been unable to survive without. I stopped caring out of nowhere.
Later on school started... I was in the program I’ve been fighting to get in for 2 years. My fiancé was moving to the US in 2 months. He came... I was happy... now fast forward today, we are married. I don’t really care about my calories anymore. Some days I count them, most days I don’t. I make sure to exercise 30 mins a day with some muscle training maybe 3x a week, but I really don’t care to do more than that. I miss days completely (something that was unspeakable just several months ago) My obsession just seemingly vanished. I realize now i was undiagnosed with probable depression and some sort of eating disorder, I was unbelievably lonely, constantly obsessed with either food or school. Always trying to be perfect.

This is my first time posting on here, also first time asking anything about ED. I'm a member of a facebook group, but here things are much more anon so I feel more comfortable here.

I've been struggling a lot with b/p over the last year, and I've been trying to stop, but I have little to no access to help. I don't have the money for treatment, nor the time because I live and work in South Korea (and we all know how mental illness is treated here). Most treatment programs aren't in my language (English--I'm not korean, I am an expat).

I depended a lot on my job to keep me from b/p behaviours and since the beginning of march, I haven't been allowed to work because of the virus. It's really putting a lot of stress on me and has caused me to go down HARD.

At this point I don't know what I should do. I don't know where to go to find help and to stop this. I'm at a complete loss. And no, I can't just return to my home country, I don't have work there, and here I am guaranteed free housing because of my job. At least there is a roof over my head.

I only have one friend who knows about my ED. But i havent heard from her in weeks and she never tries to even check up on me. I feel so alone and don't know what to do. I have no help and everyone i reach out to for advice in person just brushes me off and doesn't take me seriously because i'm not super thin. I dont want to trigger anyone with numbers or anything like that, but i am not underweight. I still have this problem though and it has become so habitual that I can't get rid of it.

2 years ago, I started having ED behavior and thoughts very strongly again, and currently I’m struggling with it - some days are better than others and I like to think that I’m improving, but other days I’m not so sure about that. 
Anyway, it quite clear by the way I eat and how I eat that my eating isn’t exactly “normal” - my close friends have noticed and picked up on this well. 
One of my close friends particularly noticed this, and would get particularly upset when I wouldn’t eat with her or eat what she was eating.....
I thought it was mainly concern about my health and well-being, but now I fear it may also stem from jealousy and insecurities with her own body image. 

Recently this friend started the gym, and she started telling me about her new “healthy” lifestyle. I encouraged her and told her that it’s good she’s making positive lifestyle changes. 
Anyway, long story short, this friend quickly ended up becoming obsessive about the gym and about the way she ate as well.... she recently began counting calories in everything, and started refusing treats and such foods. 

I know all this because this friend has made it a point to tell me. From what I gather, (and from what she’s told me), she knows I’ve gone through/am going through an eating disorder and she views me as an older sister figure who will be able to guide her and help her through this disorder......
She recognizes that her behavior is disordered and not normal. 

I truly and sincerely love this friend and am touched she views me this way and trusts me. But, I am also quite frankly jealous, and annoyed. 

The fact that my friend has started this ED journey and is losing weight is making me go insane with anger; it really has ignited my competitive streak, and I feel a strong urge to win this “competition” of who will be the skinniest. 

I know that her talking about her ED is very triggering for someone who is dealing with an ED herself. I know deep down, I should probably tell her that I’m dealing with an ED myself and am probably not the best person to help her manage it. 
But her telling me about her disordered eating has triggered a perverse response in me. I feel the need to keep tabs on what she’s eating and how she’s eating so I can make sure I eat less and exercise more than her. 

It’s such a fucked up situation because I truly love my friend. It may not seem like it (according to everything I’ve written so far), but I sincerely care about her. 
My irritation and competitiveness is making me focus on the fact that I feel threatened by her potentially becoming thinner than me, but I’m also scared for her mental health and her going down a dark and painful road......

Another thing that’s very frustrating about this situation is that I’ve urged this friend (on multiple occasions) to speak to a therapist about her eating.
However, she is VERY hesitant to do so and seems content on simply confiding in me. She is VERY open with me about her lack of eating and her excessive exercise. 

I don’t want to let her down because I realize that she views me as an empathetic figure of trust, but it is very tough for me to handle her issues in a balanced manner. 
On one hand I feel extremely irritated that my weight loss is being “challenged” and threatened, and another hand I’m genuinely scared for someone I love. 
I’m not sure what I should do or how I can handle this. Please advise me.

Have multiple mental disorders. Depression and bpd being the biggest problem. I make myself think that I'm utterly disgusting. So I'll starve myself for a few days.

And then I'll pick at my dinner but then I'll feel guilty about it later because I make myself think that I ate too much. 

Last summer I did that, was uber depressed. Lost 45lbs, i was finally under 200lbs and now I'm starting to gain some of it back and I'm actually terrified to go over 200lbs again. But my brain wont let me work out. Just makes me want to smoke weed and sleep all day.

I'm a 16yo female and have been suffering from anorexia for the past 3 years. I was hospitalized in August and stayed impatient for 2 months. 
I have been seeing a therapist and I'm supposed to be following a meal plan ever since. However, I don't always stick to my plan, I miss most of my snacks and sometimes I skip breakfast. To be more specific, I've been eating about 1200-1300 cals for the past few months, which has resulted in some weight loss. Even though I fake my weight at my physician appointment, my parents have noticed. They made it clear that if I lose even more they are going to get me to the hospital again. This happened 2 weeks ago, and I have managed to increase my calorie intake to about 1400 cals. (I have been inspired to try the minnie maud recovery method but I'm to scared to do this lol).
I can't talk to my therapist about it. She doesn't know I've been restricting, she thinks I follow the meal plan and is proud of me. However, she has told me I need to gain to get my period back. I consider myself (and I think she does as well) to be a mild case of anorexia, as I was underweight but not that much.(?)

I'm hungry and thinking about food most of the times. I eat large amounts of veggies and stuff but the volume doesn't seem to satisfy me. Today I kind of ""binged"" on 1700, which happened for the first time and now I feel guilty.
I want this to stop, I want to be able to just enjoy food. I know this affects my parents as well, which makes me feel even more guilty.

1582,1582,eating_disorders,"I have battled with anorexia on and off for years. Anorexia came into my life at a very young age. I wasn’t even double digits of age while watching videos of people with anorexia (not knowing it was a disorder). I was fascinated of how skinny these girls were. 

Anyways. Not gonna tell my whole detailed anorexia story but I started extreme dieting at age 12. Never saw a problem with it but everyone else did. I gained the weight back slowly but surely and things seemed fine for a while. I had a major weight loss one summer in high school. I was 15. Went to the first day of school and saw jaws dropping (oh and I sickly loved it). I was living off 80 calories a day proudly having a BMI of 14. Very unaware I had an “eating disorder” believe it or not. Just thought I was dieting better than anyone else could, and anyone who tried to make me gain weight was jealous (sick I know). From 15-17 I was very anorexic. From hospital stays to therapists nothing worked. I was desperate to live so I fought. I started gaining weight and getting all of the guys attention. I used boys to get over my anorexia. I had my first relationship (at 18), then my second (19-20)

Here I am just turned 21. My second relationship ended and I started talking to my ex. My (first) ex and I got in a fight over the past and haven’t really talked since then (been about a month).

I am the most single I have been since I started dating, and I find myself missing my anorexia sooo much. I hate everything it did to me, but I miss it. Is this normal? Is it possible to relapse after all this time ? Did I ever beat anorexia or did I just distract myself ??

1584,1584,eating_disorders,"Some numbers in here...

So I've always had a bizarre relationship with food.

First I have what is technically an autism eating disorder- where sensory issues severely restrict what I can/cannot eat.
Second I have an illness known as Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome so I grew up puking enough to send me to the ER to be sedated. I would skip meals or eat tiny portions or liquids only because it was SO much easier to vomit water than bread, or to dry heaves while walking with friends. It wasn't healthy but it was essential to survival. It totally screwed my metabolism.
(To be clear my vomiting was in no way related to an ED, but I think it made it easier for me to fall into habits of restrict/binge/purge after highschool.)
I grew up being ""the pretty one"" in my friend group and due to my illness issues from very young I determined the best chance of long term survival was to wield my attractiveness as a weapon to entice others to care for me even if I had no real skills.
Constantly being told that my body was my best feature put pressure on me to STAY thinner. Once my CVS was controlled I found my weight going up as the weight of the females in my family will do.
I have been restricting to water and drink flavors only, exceptions being if I am in a group eating, in which case, one small serving of something- which rapidly spirals into another, and this and that and those and then purging. Puking. Is purge the right word?

I've been very hydrated, taking potassium, getting electrolytes.

For about a week I have only eaten twice and both times purged most of it immediately.
I've started chewing food then spitting it out in my trash.
I've had more energy than I'm used to?
I definitely feel my body struggling. Joint paint has increased slightly (Chronically ill so I already had constant pains).
I'm colder more often.
I get brain zaps/tingles.
I don't even notice any abdominal pain- again strange because it was a common issue for me, and now I get maybe a tiny twinge but it's primarily silent.
I haven't actually felt hungry, just the flavors and textures cravings...

I know EDs can kill you. I know they can cause irreparable harm.

I don't know how to stop. I don't want to stop. I want to see my bones and see through my skin. A part of me says ""I'll stop at my goal weight of 130-140"" but... Lately... I don't know that I will. I was determined not to vomit after dinner, it was cabbage and chicken with just a hint of dressing, not too many calories and my first food in two days. But... I found myself getting up from the table to purge. 

I've lost about five pound so far and I still hate my body. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to love it as much as everyone else does.

I crave seeing my bones. I love the thin weak look. It feels safe.
I'm still technically overweight right now, so maybe I will get less strict as I lose pounds, but I worry that I'll spiral and not be able to see myself clearly, still feel fat when I'm more bone than meat.

I haven't told anyone about this. I don't know what type of eating disorder I fall under.

I had to move back home recently and forgot this is where my disorder stems from. But my mom has been gone out of Country and though my eating habits haven’t been the best from a new crippling depression I’ve been able to kinda internally deal with it.

I always just told myself as long as I have these abs i’m good. my self esteem tho was never great; i’ve been struggling with acne for 10 years now. however my first year of college was a beast. my grades, my mental health, and my eating habits all went to shit. I gained the freshmen 15 but in my case it was the freshmen 25. for the first time i really started paying attention to how I looked in the mirror. I could pinpoint every little detail on my body that I hate until there was nothing left for me to like. Freshmen year of college was the worst year for me mentally and to cope I would snack a lot. the summer after freshmen year I started to get my life on track while still dealing with my internal monologue.

I started smoking weed which made me want to eat more and more.

I didn’t even notice in the mirror I just saw the same fat  lard with belly rolls, but people started saying I looked so skinny and that I looked so good. that now I feel this pressure to keep losing until I can reach the weight I wanna be at.

What are the consequences of this? Well, I can't stop taking them, first because of the psychical dependency, but it's also something psychological. ""I binged, but if I want to fast I must have an empty stomach"", and that happens everytime, almost every day now. 
I need a different dose depending on how much water I drank and how much food I ate, I've learned this through time but still it's never precise, so I sometimes overdose, and I end up throwing up gastric acid, trembling and having extremely painful cramps.
I can never hang out anywhere because I always have the need to go to the bathroom, and if I do, good look feeling comfortable doing that in a public restroom.
The worst part is hemorrhoids, yeah I know it sounds even funny but the pain and bleeding is not. I couldn't even sit and the pain made me cry. Depending on the type you take, laxatives can make your intestines burn due to the acid, so imagine how corrosive it can be.
They make you dehydrated, and it doesn't matter how much water I drink my mouth is always dry. 
Plus, it makes you very bloated, so the body dysmorphia gets unbearable.

I think that's all. I just wanted to post this because I wanted to talk about it somewhere. Laxatives aren't worth the suffering at all. And sorry if I made grammatical mistakes? english isn't my main language.

It was later when I realized that I have an eating disorder. I restrict myself from eating a lot. I eat around 550-1100 calories a day for the past months. I don't know but I feel safe with my ed?? It's so weird. But I feel sad when I'm not hungry before I sleep. I don't know it's like my routine. I eat my small dinner at around 5pm then I sleep at around 1am after watching mukbangs. Sometimes I binge (approx. 1600-2000 cals) and yes, I always count my calories. It's like my life just revolves around food. I became a lying machine to my parents. Telling them that I already ate even though I did not. There are times where I refuse to go eat out with my friends and with my mom which is really sad. We used to have ""saturdate"" but my ed ruined it. But that was all like 3 months ago?? During Christmas break I'm kinda ""comfortable"" with my eating disorder??

1599,1599,eating_disorders,"I’m not sure if I have an eating disorder or not, but I feel like my relationship with food is unhealthy. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just a place to vent.

I’m 15, and a sophomore in high school. I weigh about 160 lbs, which isn’t super unhealthy, but it’s a bit overweight.

I’ve felt uncomfortable with how my body looks since fifth grade, and no matter how many people tell me that I’m not fat, I can’t stop feeling like I look 8 months pregnant every time I look in the mirror.

I go through a kind of cycle usually, I’ll binge eat super unhealthy junk food for about a week, and then I feel bad that I did that and try to throw up (doesn’t work), and then I don’t eat for a week after to try and even it out.

About a year and a half ago, I went like three months with eating maybe 500 calories a week.

Recently, I’ve been doing better and mainly eating healthy foods, but the amount of calories I eat per day is anywhere from 10 after exercise to 1,000 after exercise. The 10 calories wasn’t on purpose, I just did a lot of exercise that day and didn’t realize how little I had eaten. Today I burned about 600 calories, and feel awful eating it all back. I’m eating healthy, but somehow the idea that I ate almost 1,300 calories today (before exercise) really bothers me. 

I also don’t know how badly it will affect my body in the long term to be eating only 1,000 calories after exercising, but I don’t really even feel hungry for more than that either. I’m just at a loss for what I can do in this situation. I’m still going to continue to try and eat healthy, and focus less on calories, but I’m just stressed out about this.",,Quick Vent,2,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,f45e02,1,effortlessaphrodite,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/f45e02/quick_vent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/f45e02/quick_vent/,1581746341,317,0,0,1,-1,1,"Binge eating, purging, and restricting food intake",harmful,"Feeling uncomfortable with body image since fifth grade, Experiencing a cycle of binge eating and then trying to throw up, followed by not eating for a week, Eating only 500 calories a week at one point, Eating only 1,000 calories after exercising, which may have long-term effects on the body","Binge eating unhealthy junk food, feeling uncomfortable with body image, throwing up after binge eating, not eating for extended periods of time, eating only 500 calories a week for three months, eating only 1000 calories after exercise",harmful,"The writer is experiencing physical and emotional symptoms related to their disordered eating, including feeling uncomfortable with their body image, binge eating, purging, and restricting their food intake., The writer is stressed about their relationship with food and their calorie intake, The writer is unsure about the long-term effects of their disordered eating habits","Binge eating, trying to induce vomiting, restricting food intake, obsessing over calorie intake",harmful,"Feeling uncomfortable with body since fifth grade, Going through a cycle of binge eating and then not eating for a week, Eating as little as 500 calories a week, Stressed about calorie intake and unsure how to manage it"

1608,1608,eating_disorders,"Welp. The title really says it all. I have struggled with an eating disorder for 17 years now. I went to rehab (for what I promised to be the last time) Nov 15’-Mar 16’ and swore I would never look back. Unfortunately, I had some challenging health issues that made eating disorder recovery more complicated. After being completely weight restored and almost 6 months into recovery I began to lose weight due to a rare digestive disease. I was diagnosed at the Cleveland Clinic, and almost immediately received a feeding tube, which I had for a year and a half. During a second surgery to have a J tube placed, my surgeon discovered some twisted bowel, repaired it, and things got so much better! My digestive issues seemed to clear up, and I had my feeding tube removed last year. Eating was going remarkably well, and I was doing really well! I remained under the care of a psychiatrist and psychologist for this entire time. 

Well, I am not exactly sure when things went wrong because denial obscured my vision. Things have definitely gone wrong though. I know for sure I have relapsed. I talk with my professionals about eating behaviors, but for so long I was adamant that any weight change or vomiting was due to my digestive disease. I can not deny clear behaviors any longer. 

No matter what I do though, there seems to be a barrier to discussing this with my team. I know they are there to help, and I truly do not want to continue down the slippery road that relapse will lead to, but I am completely lost. I guess I am wondering if anyone else has been in the position of being fearful of discussing a relapse. I have considered emailing, writing it down, writing poetry, and a variety of other ways that would not be verbally telling them. I cannot bring myself to do it. Maybe I am hoping that this post will be a foot in the door. I told someone, right?

I don’t know. I’m depressed, ashamed, angry, and sad that this is where I find myself. I’m also afraid of the person I was when I was fully active in my behaviors, and that person is not who I am. That’s even more of a reason to be open, I know. And the pressure from understanding this simple fact makes it even more difficult to be open. I don’t know what to do.

1619,1619,eating_disorders,"So I'm reletively new to the ED life, on and off this past year and a half I've been binging whenever emotionally distraught (I was in a big city being looked after by people who were emotionally abusive and had gotten sexually abused several times and couldn't go to anyone about it). This led me to gain weight. I hated myself for that.



I then tried to lose the weight naturally this year after coming home to the countryside, working out a bit and lowering my calories and that worked. I lost some of it but didn't keep it off. My stress went up like crazy because of school and relationships and the gained back some of those pounds.
Awhile ago I tested to see if I could make myself throw up, and now I've perfected the technique. It feels totally normal now. These past few days I've been purging several times a day. BUT my mom has noticed which is a pain (countryside is really quiet), she even asked me about it (I ofc lied) so now I need another option. I know whenever I eat I want to binge because I haven't felt hungry the same way for the past year and a half (no idea why) and I just can't tell when I'm full unless I'm stuffed.


So, I'm going to see if I have the willpower to restrict because I love the feeling of being empty but my mind sometimes just forces me to pick up the nearest bag of chips and once I start, I don't stop until my belly feels bigger. It doesn't help that I'm stuck at home all the time, boredom = eating. 

A little disclaimer that I'm not an unhealthy weight, I used to be on the lower end of the healthy range (my friends used to call me boney and a stick but I ate completely normally) then I gained and just felt disgustingly fat. Now I don't want to think about food, just have it be chore.

1627,1627,eating_disorders,"So I spent some more time with my mom over the holidays and doing so triggered a relapse in my anorexia. It’s only been a couple weeks but it’s already worse than ever. Best part is that I’m also moving in with her next week so it’s probs not going to get better. When I had my ED in hs it was almost unintentional. I would be running late to school, not pack lunch, and not be able to afford buying any. As a result my stomach shrank and it made it super hard to eat without feeling sick. On top of that nausea was a really common symptom of my anxiety so I could only eat when I smoked weed. 

I’ve fluctuated since usually managing on the healthier side of things. This was pretty manageable and I was practicing a lot of coping mechanisms and self love work to protect myself. I don’t know exactly when it stopped working but it all really fell apart when I cut my hair last week. I’m trying to grow out an undercut so I cut all of my hair short to grow it all out together. The problem is that I don’t have a cute thin frame like most girls with pixie cuts and I just look like a boy. It really highlighted how badly I’ve been feeling. I haven’t felt pretty, or feminine, or beautiful, or sexy in at least a couple months. I tried to go out on NYE and I couldn’t find anything to wear bc all I own now are baggy sweaters and sweatpants. I didn’t even realize that I’ve been hiding my body so badly until then. That thought burned in my head and when I cut my hair everything crumbled. It started slow, I convinced myself I was just trying to get healthy and then I just started eating less and less and going to the gym more and more. Today was the worst. I only ate like less than half of the calories I’m supposed to and when I got hungry again I scratched my stomach until it was raw.

Now look. I know it all. I know I need to get help and that this isn’t healthy but as much as I know that there’s this huge part of me that can’t stop. It’s like I don’t want to see a therapist until I have already lost the weight. Like I’d rather be skinny than healthy right now.

1628,1628,eating_disorders,"So  yeah. Title says it all really. My eating habits got out of control again and I desperately want to loose weight.  I loose weight there’s so much I can do in life and it would make me a lot happier. I had this same habits at secondary school quite a few years ago and it’s never really left or ever fully recovered? There’s stages where it gets really bad or that it’s fine, but it’s never either one of the other?? However never have I really had the binging aspect of it? Untill now that is.... so along with not eating/ skipping meals or counting calories I then have days where I really couldn’t care what I looked like and would eat normally again almost binging? Although it’s minor binging not like eating all sweets or savoury it s more the fact I’ll go that’s nice I’ll eat more of that or I really fancy this right now? Anyone know why that is? But I’ll have like 5 days where I’m not hungry and won’t allow myself to eat extra calories and then randomly will wake up one day hungry??

Also!!!! If I have a rough time with my eating and not eat a lot it’ll on appear on my body like a month later? So when my friends or parents tell me I’m skinny and not eating and showing them I am then ... idk 😂 just like “ wut” why now on my body as I’m starting to recover and then because how I like how it looks and feels I delve back into it!!!

I’m very sneaky I got to admit. My parents never clock into it. Personally I’m not one to binge and throw up. I just secretly advoid the food or always swap to the healthier options or leave the high calories and sugar and carbs alone and stay far away. Very rarely my parents catch me out and say I’m looking thin so will make me eat a very rich and high calorific dinner and to enjoy it. But I never can? I’m always sat there feeling sick at how rich it is and just the Thought of putting that much strain on my body? And subconsciously I end up throwing it all back up without having to put my fingers down my throat 🤷‍♀️

It’s kinda an endless cycle that I struggle with by myself? I confined in my boyfriend which is nice but... sometimes he triggers it. 
He binge eats when feeling depressed and sometimes it gets too much for me and disgusts me of food or how he can do that to his body? He’ll eat till it hurts? And it really scares me. So secretly I start dieting. I can’t tell him as he gets guilty and then more depressed as he tries to diet with me but has no motivation so gives up after a few days and his weight is starting to scare me alittle. Like when we hug I feel like I get crushed sometimes and intermate moments just feels overwhelming and like I’m trapped? Just very clostrophibic. I don’t want to tell him again as I don’t want to be mean and I’ve hinted for years that we b out h diet together to loose weight and I’ve tried to support him so much but every time he gives up?.... and after 2 years of trying I’ve given up trying to help him as it’s making me worse? It’s selfish I know but I don’t want my bad habits getting worse so I’ve left that part up to him to control and try to manage. Ofcourse I’ll support but I can’t be the one to lead.

1629,1629,eating_disorders,"Like title says, I feel pretty tempted to make myself throw up rn. 
I don’t have an eating disorder or anything (yet? Or that I am aware of?) I’m just posting here bc this is kinda weird and scary and I wanna talk to someone but I don’t have anyone to talk to abt it :/ 

Basically the first time I felt this way was last week-ish. I had eaten something my body didn’t agree with, unexpectedly. I have IBS so this isn’t uncommon. 
Also Started going to therapy and having to talk about narcissist mom and loneliness and stuff like that, means i can’t really ignore how depressed I am like I used to be able to. So I had a pretty crappy week. Anyways that also contributed to my wanting to puke, rather than just waiting for it to go away. I don’t really know how exactly? It kinda felt like it just did somehow. Consciously, the way I justified it to myself was that “I want to puke because I don’t want this food to trigger a flare up.” Which doesn’t rly make sense? I’m always in a constant state of flare up anyways? And all I have to do is just not eat anything for the rest of the day and take gas-x and call it good???? Idk how else to explain it. I hope it makes sense. Anyways, I kinda tried a little bit, but I didn’t do it. 

Fast forward to today, we got a short break during class. I went to buy a little thingy of instant ramen during my break to eat in class, which I’ve been doing lately bc of PMS cravings. When I got to the store thingy to buy some, I wasn’t excited like I thought I would be, wasn’t hungry, and i was actually a little full from having JUST eaten yogurt and several snacks earlier. I wasn’t even rly craving it. I bought it anyways. It was compulsive. Went back to class and was about to eat. Still wasn’t excited, or feeling anything at all anyways. Finished all of it. Didn’t enjoy it, it was the opposite actually. I felt gross and guilty. A bit sick to my stomach. Feeling upset at myself for eating it. And of all things I could have eaten compulsively, it was THAT. Fuck lmfao. Couldn’t pay attention in class just thinking about inducing vomit as soon as class was out. Went to the bathroom and didn’t even try, mainly bc it’s a public bathroom and that’s yucky lol. 

Anyways. Feeling disgust and shame after compulsive eating isn’t a new thing for me. Wanting to puke is a new thing, although the idea may have crossed my mind a few times before, but I never thought twice about it.
I don’t really know what I’m asking for here. Advice, validation, slap some sense into me??? Idfk lol. I really DO want to actually induce vomit sometime in the future tho. I think it would make me feel better when I eat things that make me feel gross.

Random afterthought: i have anxiety and I think sometimes I confuse physical pain when it’s actually anxiety...? Even though anxiety can cause stomachaches sometimes? I don’t know what to do with this information yet, I literally JUST thought of it lmao.

I'm 5'8"" and I used to be about 130lbs which I guess is normal for my height but I went to an event when I was 18 and a guy like...pat my stomach and made a comment about a ""fat belly"" and since then I've been obsessed with losing weight. 

It started innocently, I just wanted to lose 10lbs and bring myself down to 120lbs. I started excersing and counting my calories but I thought I was being healthy about it and it wasn't going to be a problem....I reached my goal of 120lbs but I still felt fat so I told myself ""just 10 more pounds and then you have to stop this."" At this point I started doing long fasts that lasted days and days. 

So I did exactly that and reached 110lbs in a few months....but it's stil wasnt enough. I could feel my bones and see all of them but I wanted to be smaller. I wanted to be 100lbs. 

I achieved that goal rather quickly, but people started making comments about how grossly thin I was and i always felt sick, lethargic and incredibly grumpy. it made me insecure so I told myself enough was enough we were going to get back to 120lbs as was the original plan and I tried but once I got to 115lbs I just....hated myself. I felt sick even thinking of eating or gaining a single more pound and am now back at 110lbs again. 

I can't stop obsessing over this, I can barely handle this. I love being hungry, it feels like doing drugs to me. Its lovely but I want to stop caring so much. I want to be able to weigh a healthy amount and still love myself. 

I keep wanting to lose more and more and more until there's nothing left. I know I'm sick and need help but I don't even know where to start.  The idea of eating normally and not looking at calories or avoiding carbs is terrifying.

When i diagnosed with anorexia at 13 my parents closed me at a clinic. I gaind 6kg/12 lbs there. But of corse that doesnt mean i was recovering at all. From anorexia i went to orthorexia. I was scared to eat to much but i was also scared to lose weight and go again at the clinic. After a while I started to binge. I couldnt control it. I started gaining weight. Always thinking ""i need to lose weight"". I find the dolution to purge, i thought this could help me lose weight and i could also binge. Of corse this didnt happen cause with purging you lose only the 20%of what you ate. So i continue gaining. I gained 16kg/ 32lbs and i was so sad. I was so ashamed with my body, i couldnt even go out, even at school. Always on a diet. On a sick diet. I finally began to cut the binging and the purging. I told myself that i could do it only 2 times a week. I lost 6kg/12lbs. I felt nice and happy( not at all but you know). I finally could control it. But i still had to lose until my goal. I still had to find a way to lose. So i started to getting laxatives. I end up eating like 6 almost every day. My metabolism was fucked, my stomach always was in pain and i was feeling so bad. I finally cut it and now im so better with out this bullshit. I still wanna lose weight. I ve been so many times at psycoligist. No one helped.

1651,1651,eating_disorders,"I think even if I don't fit the criteria for ed, that my eating has been disordered for a long time. I was 11 when I restricted my eating for the first time. It started after trauma happened and became my coping strategy and much more.

 If I was anxious I felt nauseous so I wouldn't eat, if I was scared of sitting alone, if I got into trouble by a teacher or was upset I'd 'punish' myself by not eating but I couldn't keep it up for long. 

Pretty soon I was raiding the fridge at night after restricting all day because I felt like I deserved it. My mum said I was 'stealing' by having food from the fridge at night without asking and that caused further guilt and Shame. I started to restrict at school and binge at home so nobody was the wiser. When I gave in I felt disgusting. I couldn't and still struggle to look at myself in the mirror. 

It got worse, and my clothes started dropping off. People come ted that I looked great and it turned me even though I started wearing belts to keep my trousers from falling down.  I purged after every meal. I spit my food out into a cup, I took ages to eat and played with my food. This happened for a good six months but I developed a fear of being sick and stopped purging. Instead just binging and feeling guilty so restricting.

I make it a game to see how long I can heal with the hunger pangs even now. I like having them. I keep pictures of anorexic people and unhealthy quotes on my phone. I used to surf pro Ana and pro Mia websites for tips. 

Now almost 13 years later I'm obese after a hormone problem and binging led to a sudden rapid weight gain. I eat one or two meals a day and I still stay the same weight. I'm picky with my foods due to having autism and with chronic pain, I find it hard to exercise. I feel no matter what I do It just doesn't help. 

I did decide to try weight watchers a few years ago as my doctor is concerned for my health due to being overweight and I am too. The only time I lost any weight was eating soup for every meal every day. I became obsessed with calories and would panic because I like to know everything exactly, how much butter am I spreading on this sandwich? I would freak if I couldn't get the exact calorie info for something I was eating and so I'd give up again and go back to restricting and feeling guilty.

1660,1660,eating_disorders,"hey, so recently because of winter break, I've spent most of my time inside my house, also meaning I've had open access to the kitchen cabinet. I've had a conflicting relationship with food and weight for a few years now, I won't let myself eat during school hours even if it hurts, but when I'm at home, I'll eat as much as i want even if I'm not feeling hungry. Sometimes I'll eat so much that it hurts; to a point where vomit starts to burn my throat without me forcing it out. I don't purge, but sometimes I want to puke because I've eaten so much that it hurts. In the beginning of the break I weighed 112 lb , but now I'm all the way up to 115 lb (BMI 19.5). I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but i look in the mirror and it shows, I want to have a flat stomach, I want to feel healthy, but all the food my family buys is filled with carbs, and we barely have any fruits and vegetables in the house. Me and my mom are going shopping for better food, but I use food as a distraction. Do ya'll have any ways of distracting yourselves when your sad or bored, any ways other than food.

1661,1661,eating_disorders,"I am in such a tough spot right now. A lot has happened in the past 3 months with myself and my dad (personal matters) that have really taken a toll on my mental health. I had never seen my dad take mental health days until these past 3 months occurred and I wish there was more I could do to help him. 

On top of all my personal issues, I got screwed over by my university for the 7th time once again delaying my graduation to where I have to take a whole extra year to get my bachelors. My eating was slowly starting to get better, but now none of us can afford health insurance so I currently can't see doctors or specialists. I do get free counseling on campus, but they don't specialize in eating disorders. I went from eating 1/2 a meal a day at home to consistently eating 1-2 meals a day on campus despite my hectic schedule. I know that's amazing especially since it's so hard to eat on campus and lugging everything to the kitchen downstairs where someone may or may not be using it is a huge challenge, so I tend not to cook on campus.

I just don't know why when it comes to being home, my eating habits are worse. I have now gone from eating 2 meals a day consistently to eating 1 meal a day. I have binge-eating disorder and I have managed to only fill my dorm with snacks that I have that won't trigger my IBS and that I won't feel guilty snacking on because they are in some regard healthier than what I could be snacking on. 

I guess to top off the stress, I have no idea what I want to do with my life still or what I should be doing with it and I'm in my 8th out of 9th year of college right now. I feel as though I should have really honed what I want to do at this point so I could start applying to remote jobs (my skillset allows for me to work from home and not in an office space which I really don't like). Should I choose to move out within the year, getting a remote job would be ideal since I do have someone I could rent a house with and I won't have a car for a while due to paying off debt. 

I have spent the majority of my last few years just lost and depressed and anxious about everything. I don't know where to begin anymore or what questions to ask or even to get myself out of bed for that matter. Do I need to move out? Would it be more beneficial to my mental health to move out? The worst part about thinking about moving out is that I feel like I'm abandoning my family as I have a sibling with cerebral palsy. I kind of feel like I'd be walking out on them in a way. I love my family don't get my wrong, but my mother and I butt heads all the time and it's really frustrating and anxiety inducing for me.

I feel like I'm just rambling at this point. For a TLDR: I'm not eating well when I should be at home and it was harder to eat on campus. On campus I managed to begin maintaining at least 2 meals a day instead of 1/2 or 1 meal a day. I have a lot of stressors and feel really lost and just don't know what to do anymore.

1665,1665,eating_disorders,"TW: abuse mention, numbers (calories). It's a long one, sorry.

Other than a few-days lapse about two years ago, I've been free of this shit for almost 5 years.

Then some nasty PTSD triggering happened (long story short, my stepdad--former sexual abuser--got sick, been having to help my mother with him, he has early stage dementia and made a grossly sexual comment at me and touched my ass) a few weeks ago. I saw him again at Christmas but didn't say anything to him, which was fine, huge family so nobody noticed.

I'm in therapy for PTSD/depression/anxiety. I'm getting the help. I'll be restarting meds after the first of the year. I work in mental health, for God's sake, I know the coping skills. I'm working with my therapist on reducing contact with my mother and her husband (I can't cut contact, which is a story for another day).

But I've been extra anxious lately. And when I'm really anxious I get sick to my stomach and my appetite tanks and I forget to eat, maybe a small meal a day. (Was the reduced appetite from anxiety the cause of, or a result of, my ED? Chicken or the egg, the world may never know)

I realize I'm getting about 900 cal a day, half of it in coffee creamer. And the scale is dropping. And then I start drinking a little less coffee and a little more diet coke. And then if I eat more than 300 calories in a stretch I feel an overwhelming urge to purge it. I haven't, so far. I've been good on that front.

Y'all. I see the train wreck coming but can't step off the fucking tracks.

 I just can't make myself want to eat. It's not like it was way back when, obsession over my body and the numbers and all of that. I respect my body. It's a good, strong tool. It's made *people*. I don't want to be the weak shell I used to be.

I've got kids now, like I mentioned. I don't want them to see the heartache and drama and agony that goes with this. I don't want to tell them that Mommy can't play because she's too tired. I don't want them to notice that I'm not eating.

And I'm starting fucking grad school in two weeks. How the fuck do I handle that if I can't get my stupid brain to focus?

I'll be mentioning this to my therapist at my next appointment. Probably. It's honestly really embarrassing. I should have more self control than this.

He doesn’t seem healthy at all and I don’t know what to do. I feel like he may shut down and isolate himself if I approach this directly or in the wrong way. 

Can you help me with advice on what to do? What helped you seek treatment? 

Am I too close to him and need someone else to talk to him? He has lost almost all of his close friends over the last year because of his tendency to isolate and push others away. The only person he talks to regularly is his gym partner, who may be encouraging these habits.

1674,1674,eating_disorders,"Hi I'm a 17y/o Male I'm pretty sure I have anorexia, I have a family member who had anorexia, and another with a poor relationship to food.

I'm pretty sure everything started when I was 9. We moved across the country for my dad to get a MBA, He was so busy he basically wasn't there. Then My mom had some very serious health issues that almost cost her life. In short a lot of stress, almost no support, and I needed a way to cope.

Things got really bad last fall once I started eating lettuce and pickles for lunch and restricting. This time last year I got really depressed (I have times of depression caused by my ed) and my mental health steadily declined until June of this year, when I ended up in the ER (depression related) After my ER stay and a lot of therapy my mental well being got a lot better. I started learning coping skills for reducing my anxiety, and my depression.  I don't really know how my ED doing during this time because I didn't think I had one.

Recently I realized I was doing a really good job following the definition of an anorexic. So I decided to get better. I started reintroducing foods, stopped restricting to meal times, and was making progress. And I felt Great, I was doing more, feeling better, had less pain, happier and really progressing on my mental health.  Then this last Wednesday came around. First a little context. I had a YT channel I posted on a lot a year or two ago, I told my family and it got up to 400 subs (big family(jk)). Recently I came out to my parents as bi, I also decided to come out on YT since others videos had helped so much. I forgot my uncle had sub'd and he saw it. The following conversation was good and supportive but it still caused a relapse.

So currently I'm restricting, depressed, super anxious, and weak like I'm going to pass out.

My goal is to get though Christmas happy and not drained.

Anyway this is what I'm going though. I'm going to try to get though the holidays and then talk to my parents so they aren't worried.

First of all, sorry if this is not the place to seek advice, but I'm overwhelmed and I can't talk about this with my parents or friends.

This week is also the week before my 'period' so PMS might have something to do, and it's also the week before a very sad day that triggers my suicidal ideation so my feelings are all over the place and... well, I can't focus on my exam.

I was thinking of raising my intake, but I'm really scared and I feel like trying something this radical on such an emotional week is not going to help.

Then the depression hit and the 30 lbs I lost was gained back in about 6 months and ever since the beginning of 2019 I have been struggling with food. I started college at the beginning of September and honestly my bingning has spiraled ever since. I eat til I’m ill almost every day and then wake the next day and tell my self I’m not going to eat and instead fast for the whole day to make up for everything I ate the day before. It’s a vicious, exhausting cycle with a few weeks in between where I seem to have control again, then lose it and start the cycle again. Tonight, I felt especially horrible after my binge and decided to make myself throw it all back up. The issue is that the purging made it feel so much better and made me feel almost calm? I know it is so terrible for me and I would have never expected to be the person who this would happen to. I just don’t know where to turn because it feels like the only way to gain control is by throwing it back up. :( anyways that’s my rant and I’m sorry if it made no sense.

1698,1698,eating_disorders,"Last night, I cried a little before getting in the shower with my boyfriend because I didn't want him to see what I've become. As if he hasn't. Then he initiated sex and I went with it because I've been dismissive of his needs. We decide to finish showering and finish this afterwards.

Got back to it a bit later in the living room, but had to move to the bed because the futon ""wasn't built for this and might break"" (we've successfully fucked on that thing many times in the past...). 

Go to the bed, switch up positions, and I hear the fat slaps starting and turned to cry into the bed. He's getting tired and I know I should get on top to finish, but my tears have welled up and began to fall out of my eyes. I can't let him see these, I can't talk about this right now, I'm mortified. I successfully hide my tears and distress. He says we can take a break. 

He leaves the bedroom and I try to gather myself, pretending to look for my shirt to lag behind a bit. I heat up my tea, blow my nose, wipe away the few more tears that escaped my eyes, and go back to the futon with him. We don't cuddle like we were before. He eventually falls asleep, laying on the opposite side (so feet to feet). My thighs in the foreground of my view, I stare at him, amazed he's put up with me for so long and disgusted in myself for the unintentional cruelty. Denying him sex and intimacy because I can't let go of myself for one moment. 

He admitted a few weeks ago how guilty he feels because I haven't orgasmed in a while. I know he can't hear me despite my efforts to explain it has nothing to do with him, the quality of sex, or my attraction to him.

1715,1715,eating_disorders,"Like my ed rules are basically restricting, eating as little as possible. 
Then sometimes I'm like I'm hungry. I should eat. Then I sit in front of the fridge/the cupboard/go to the supermarket, take things out of the fridge. Put them back. take them out. put them back. And then I eat something. My ed is like nooo you can't do that. You're such a failure. You're weak. 
At the same time I don't want to recover. I don't eat because I want to recover. I eat because it's an instinct. Because I get so hungry that I don't function properly anymore. I eat because I don't have any control over it. Because at some point my body just listens to its instinct, ignores my brain and eats.

1719,1719,eating_disorders,"I grew up very skinny. I was smaller than everyone on the football team, and I was always the skinny emo kid. I was always underweight, but I ate enough food. I wasn't self-conscious of it until my guardian would force me to drink protein shakes and eat protein bars before leaving the house. She'd make me sit at the table and eat fries and milkshakes before I could go to bed. She was always making comments about how gross it was.

I live in southern US, so of course a lot of people here are very big. I know it's linked to poverty, but it's insane how EVERYONE here is usually very large. I would constantly get ""chicken legs"" or ""you need to eat a cheeseburger"" comments. I felt emasculated and have been called a ""faggot"" my whole life for looking the way I do. I graduated high school at like 110 lbs, 6'1"". I ate junk food all the time. I ate all the time.

I didn't gain weight until I hit 23. I finally hit 160. I saw candid photos of myself and saw that my legs were thicker, shoulders (biggest insecurity) were wider, etc. I fell in love with my body. I was growing a beard and finally felt like a man, and not a twink anymore. Three months or so pass and I'm at 190. I'm trying on clothes at TJ Maxx and my gut is hanging over and I can barely breathe as I'm bending over. Now I was fat as fuck. A couple months later I shaved my beard to see what I'd look like, because it had been a while. I saw how big my double chin was. I used to have a chiseled jaw and was told I was ""model material"", but I had become what looked like what women call a neckbeard, without the beard. I grew my beard back out and ignored it. A year later I started to really lift weights so I could obtain the ""strongman"" look and embrace my stature. I did this for several months, and started seeing a girl I had a crush on for years. I was driving to Ohio to see her every weekend. The first time I visited her, I was so focused on her that I honestly forgot to eat for three days. I didn't even think about being hungry. After I noticed this, I realized it was pretty easy to just not eat. I dropped 15 lbs pretty fast. I was going to the gym a lot still, and my girlfriend and I were having very frequent sex. I was no longer out of breath while doing so, and I honestly think it helped me lose weight, being cardio and all. I stopped eating so much, and I watched myself drop 50 lbs over the course of a month or so.

A few months went by and she started acting weird. I could not eat. I didn't even feel the need to eat. She eventually dumped me, and I went like a week or a week and a half without eating. I dropped my weight fast, and got down to 155. I started taking photos of myself and I looked amazing. Most of my gut was gone, legs looked pretty again, etc. I was no longer a ""fat fuck"". But I shaved my beard and my neck was kinda still there. I started doing the ""neck exercise"" again where you motion like you're kissing the ceiling, but I still feel gross. I'm up to 160 again. I'm constantly going to the gym and weighing myself. I'm not lifting weights as I don't have the energy or drive to do it anymore. I'm constantly covering my neck. My gut still feels gross when I sit down. I know, I know. ""Everybody's looks like that when they sit down!"" Well I used to not feel disgusting.  


I'm also lactose intolerant and addicted to drinking milk so I shit my brains out. I gave myself hemorrhoids this way a month ago but they're gone. However, I've noticed that it helps.

I love food way too much. It's not the pangs that bother me, it's not tasting food. I've considered tasting it and spitting it back out but haven't gone that far, yet. It's very difficult for me to throw up, so I just don't eat. I'm going insane over here. It's all I think about. I see pictures of me three years ago and my jaw looked so nice.

I need help. I had some issues with my eating in high school and got help and was doing pretty good until college started. I restrict to cope with anxiety and to punish myself for whatever I feel like I've done even slightly wrong. I'm worried that I'm close to being in a dangerous spot but I'm not sure. I'm 21 F with a height of 5' 4"" and weighing 103 lbs. I can eat two toaster waffles and feel satisfied for most of the day. If I try to eat more than a few bites of a proper meal, I'll feel overly full and on the verge of getting sick. I'm pretty sure the only reason that I'm above 100 lbs is because of a medication I'm on that has a side effect of weight gain (which is why I wanted that specific one, i wanted to fill out more and look less like a stick person) but my body cant support the weight. I think if I were to lose it I could function a bit better at work (I take food to people's seats at a small movie theater) but as it stands right now, I run one order out and by the time I'm back in the kitchen I'm tired and I need to sit. Even just standing can feel exhausting. I had a bit if a flare up of anxiety this morning where my heart started racing and i dont think my body could supply the energy for it to do that and i felt no matter how deeply i breathed i couldnt get enough oxygen. I'm still feeling like i cant get air and I'm laying down just typing this out on my phone. I'm probably dehydrated too. My boyfriend has been trying to help me eat and I feel like a disappointment when I cant eat just those few bites like he's been asking me to for a half hour. My mom said she cant do it again (referring to the major issues I had in high school with my mental health) and I dont want to hurt her again. The last thing she needs right now is the stress of me in a hospital bed and her feeling like a failure because she couldnt help me even though she couldnt have done much anyway. I feel like im letting everyone in my world down right now with my failing classes and failure to eat but I dont know what else to do right now. What I'm trying to say is how long do I have to make a change before I end up hospitalized?


TL;DR- I can eat like max 2 or 3 toaster waffles and feel full for most of the day. I'm prob dehydrated too. I'm 5' 4"" and 103 only because a medication prevents me from losing more weight.

1728,1728,eating_disorders,"Hey guys, i wanted to share with you my history with food. I've always had a sweet tooth since i was little, i was living with my grandparents 98% of my life so they treated me well with food and sweets. Ive never been into shape, my whole life i body shamed myself because i never looked my best. When i was around 16-17 years old i kinda stop eating that much i was skinny.. but not fit. i truly didn't feel hungry. At that time my ex-boyfriend literally after 3 weeks of dating, got a pretty bad rare disorder ""Galenbare"" i thinks it called this but not sure.. i stopped eating i was under so much stress, cuz you know one day you see a person perfectly healty and the next they they cant walk, talk and do anything by themselves. He broke up with me because he didn't want me to feel bad for him and yeah( he is better and healthier now tho).
So yeah , a year later i found my current boyfriend and then everything started to go downhill with my eating. Im not sure exactly when it strarted (my binge period) but i remember smoking quite a lot of weed and i was everything an enormous amount of food when i was high. Everything tasted so good and in a year i reached my highest weight 64kg. Which is not a lot but i was chubby and i felt gross. At the beginning of 2019 in April i decided to start working on my body weight . For 4 months i was doing Intermittent Fasting and it worked i lost around 5kg without changing my diet. then when i saw the results but i stopped losing weight any more, i moved to something more extreme Keto Diet. I knew it will be a change, because of my obsession with carbohydrates ..but i wanted to challenge myself just to see what will happen. I was doing great the first 2 weeks, i was eating a lot less, because fats made me full for 4 hours and in just 2 weeks i lost 4kg. i was so proud of myself. Until my life became a mess, me and my boyfriend got thrown out in the middle of the night from our landlord, accusing us for not paying 1 month rent a 1 and half ago .. we slept 2 week in a strangers house(a friend of our friend) me and my boyfriend lost our jobs, we just started a new more stressful one, we moved into a new place, we didn't have furniture, we were starting 2nd year university.. and we didn't got paid by our last employer.. so yes it was kinda an amazing experience. The 2 weeks spend into the strangers houce, i didn't cook i felt uncomfortable to do it.. so my Keto diet was over.. and you could imagine what happened.. i gained everything back ... 7kg in to months.. 
The worst part is i documented my weight loss journey on social media (Instagram) people loved my results they were proud... after what happened i stopped using my instagram i was and still am ashamed of myself..  I don't look in the mirror i don't take pictures i don't even look at my body while im taking a shower... I only feel shame, i don't feel good about my body, i dont like my legs, bottom and belly... 
Im trying so hard to stop my binge eating but it is so difficult, i start my day feeling ready to change my diet i eat a nice good salad or smoothie and after that i just buy myself 10 donuts and eat them just to feel full .. The speed im eating them is crazy literally after 15 minutes they are gone and am hungry again.. i feel like i want to make myself sick.. Sometimes after my binge period i just want to throw up everything just to take the guilt out of my shoulders. And im starting to think more and more about throwing up because i don't think i can ever stop overeating... i would never feel satisfied after meal ..
What do you suggest?
Any tips, any idea what to do ? 
Should i buy appetite suppressant?
Should i see a doctor about that?

I just want to vent since I have no one close to talk to about this. Although I accidentally told my sister and her fiancé when we were high about a month ago and after that we haven't talked about it, I'm happy that they haven't brought it up but honestly I don't think they have because they don't know how to tackle it. I want to tell someone, and I want to talk more to my sister about it but I'm afraid that they'll try to ""control"" me, or just because I've told them they think I want to recover and they'll want to help.

I've always had a ""normal"" weight, but I've never liked how huge my hips looked, and I couldn't wear a high waist skirt and not think about how much it showed how big my hips were, and I think my hips are the main reason for this.

I've had an on and off relationship with (undiagnosed) anorexia since I was about 16. In high school I almost lived on water during school hours due to my depression, about one year after high school I lived in a folk high school and I started to purge from time to time, two years later I moved into my first apartment and bought a lot of diet suppliments and weight loss powders.   
But it has never been as serious as now, one and a half years after moving into my apartment, before I just half-assed everything and ""relapsed"" into eating normal every time. Now I'm counting every calorie and I'm having weight-ins every morning and night, writing down the weight every time.  
This time it all started at the start of this year with me getting a gym membership to actually get healthy (I sit in front of my computer a lot), then I wanted to restrict on chips and candy to feel even healthier (I have a huge sweet tooth), then I bought a scale and realised that I weighted way more than I thought I did (When I still lived at home I would weigh myself just because and I'd always be 5kgs/11lbs up and down, being just above underweight).

It just became a downward spiral from there, I started tracking *every* calorie I consumed, I started fasting, I never ate past 7pm, I purged when I binged. 

Today I woke up and realised I was officially underweight, and I want to keep going, but at the same time I want to start eating healthy and excersise and *really* have a healthy body, but knowing how many calories there are in everything terrifies me.  
I'm moving in with my boyfriend in two weeks and my plan is to lose as much weight as I can until then and after that start eating good and excersise. I want to make a good transition, but I'm afraid that it won't work mentally or that he'll find out or that I'll have to tell him. I don't know, I might come with an update in about two weeks.

I've never been one to deny food to anyone so I never say anything, either to him or to people who help themselves to my food, I'm fully aware its irrational and kind of fucked up to be angry about someone eating food even after I've offered but it still makes me mad.

1753,1753,eating_disorders,"Before anyone tells me to seek professional help, I am. I have a doctors appointment next week, I’ve just been thinking about this a lot and need to write it out and get it out of my head. It’s probably gonna be pretty long too so I understand if you just skim or something.

Background: 
I am 18 years old, female, pretty average in every way. The one thing that has made me stand out my whole life is that I’m skinny. Everyone always commented about it. Right now I’m 5’5ish and around 100lbs. I have toothpick legs and spaghetti noddle arms and barely an ounce of fat on my body. This has become my identity, it’s how people recognize me, it’s just me. I am fully aware that this is not healthy and I could gain a few pounds, but the thought of even gaining 5-10 pounds and losing my skinny identity is really scary to me. I don’t look at myself and think I’m fat or disgusting, I don’t starve myself, I don’t binge and purge. I don’t have any of the typical eating disorder symptoms. It’s just the fear of gaining weight and losing such a big part of my identity. 

More recently:
These past few months have brought a lot of change (mostly adjusting to college) and with that, newfound anxiety. I’ve been struggling with it since August and I haven’t really had anything done about it because I kept telling myself it would go away on it’s own. Well, it hasn’t, and ow it’s starting to physically affect me. That’s a whole different story, but the eating part is what concerns me. I’ve always been a really picky eater and not a huge eater. I mostly only ate for survival. I never really saw the enjoyment in food that other people saw. I would get hungry, and I’d eat. That was all. Since August, I haven’t had any appetite. I’d go days eating basically nothing because I just wasn’t hungry or the thought of eating made me sick. Occasionally I’d feel physically starving and have to force myself to eat. It’s gotten a little better this last month and I started eating again. 

Why I’m concerned about this now:
Thursday morning, I ate breakfast as usual, Thursday day, I ate minimal snacks (college schedule doesn’t leave time for a proper lunch, so I snack), Thursday night, I get in my first, minor car accident on my way home, no injuries, but it kickstarted my anxiety again. Thursday night I was just so stressed and anxious after the accident, and it was late, so I went straight to bed without eating. Friday morning, I woke up starving, so I went to eat. While I was waiting for my breakfast to cook, I get faint and dizzy. Long story short, I end up on the floor in my room, with a killer headache and a giant bruise on my face, completely disoriented, and terrified. My mom calls the doctor, they say to have the ambulance come, ambulance comes, all my vitals are fine but my blood sugar is 60. Which is way too low. They tell me to go to the ER to make sure I didn’t damage my head at all. It was all fine, but blood sugar was still way too low. They tell my I’m probably hypoglycemic and after doing some research,  I think I have been all my life. Easy fix is to just eat, right? Well for whatever reason, I can’t. And that’s why I’m wondering if the stuff I explained earlier is an eating disorder. Again, I am going to a doctor in a few weeks but I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and how you got through it or if it is a sign of an eating disorder or just any advice.

1754,1754,eating_disorders,"Hello!
So, wow, where to start?
I've been in a very well known clinic for 6months getting threament for BPD and severe bulimia and trichotillomania. I got my BPD diagnosed years ago, stopped cutting myself when I was 18 and instead became anorexic, then bulimic. I was on the edge of dying many times. I stole food from grocery stores and friends, lost my job, couldn't pay my rent anymore due to all the ones I spent on my binge food.

Finally this year I decided to give my recovery another try. Tbh I didn't believe I would get anywhere, like becoming 'clean' for a lost case like me was just impossible.

However. It worked. It took 6 months for me to get better but I'm OK now. OK with the weight I have gained. OK with the unwanted but actually cute pixie cut I have now. I don't binge anymore and I can take part in social happenings without asking myself all the time when can I finally fucking binge again?
This clinic really helped me save me from myself and learn to understand, accept and yes, eventually love myself.

However, next week I'll leave. It's time. I understand that I need to leave and pick up the threads of my old life again eventhough I'm impossible scared. Scared I might not make it.
It feels like.. I'm being abandoned again. I can't stay here. This is no longer a save place for me. But I don't want it to feel like that. I want to leave in peace with my mind and the memory of my time here..
Today, I went shopping for binge food again.i ate. I purged. I picked out a lot of my hair and it makes me so insanely frustrated because it took so long for my hair to look as OK as it does now.
I'm scared
It's all coming back

1757,1757,eating_disorders,"Does anyone else obsess over their thoughts about how many times they eat vs what they actually eat? I’ve never really been the type to calorie count so instead I measure my “progress” of eating on how many times a day I eat something. Like if I eat a huge bowl of cereal for breakfast, a brownie and sandwich for lunch, and a big bowl of pasta for dinner (just an example) then I would probably feel better than if I ate an apple for breakfast, two milk duds in between, some graham crackers for lunch, an almond in between, and a normal dinner or something (again, just an example). Its like I 1) think I should only have three times a day to eat and if I eat anything outside of what I have sanctioned off as my one food for that time it is utterly horrible, and 2) even the tiniest starburst that a friend offers or a piece of gum in between completely throws it off and I see it as a form of grazing and get mad at myself for. I don’t even care about content of food anymore its just when.

1761,1761,eating_disorders,"I've been under the impression that i beat my eating disorder by myself, a couple of years ago,  but i've been having a reflective couple of months and I'm starting to think that that's not the case... 

I am 22 (F), 5'7"" , currently weighing a healthy 120 lbs, and I am in my last year of university. 

My ED reached its peak when I was 16-18, in my senior year of highschool.  In the midst of academic stress, a toxic relationship, insecurity, extreme body dysmorphia and just general depression, I found comfort in my ADHD meds that promised hunger suppression - It was such a relief, ""FINALLY"", I thought , ""something I can control"".

 At 17 I started to restrict my eating and I dropped 20 lbs in less than two months, finally weighing 95 lbs. I couldn't see myself clearly. I would always see my skinny friends as significantly skinnier than me and looking back, at pictures from that time, it is obvious that I was significantly skinnier than all of them.

How did I get passed this? I moved and went to University. I found great friends and an environment that I THRIVED in. I was finally in control of so many aspects of my life.

Or so I thought...

**I think that I felt like I had rid myself of the disorder because I made so much progress so quickly.** 

I still subconsciously seek comfort in the ""appetite suppressant"" side effects of my meds during times of stress, like during midterm season or during finals. It's like it's my safety blanket when I feel out of control.

I recently realized that the only reason that I allow myself to not care about what I eat (especially during the summer) is because I rely on my Adderall to give me those boundaries. During the summer, when i'm generally medication-free, I drink and eat what I want and gain more weight than I am comfortable with. The thoughts that go through my mind during those times are along these lines: "" Don't worry, you'll get back on your medication. With Adderall's help, you'll go on a fast for a few days, and all of this will go away. It's just temporary, you can get rid of it. You've done it before"". Then I continue to laugh with my friend, seemingly care-free. But i'm not care-free, am i? My weight does stress me out. I do think about it all the time. 

Sometimes, I find myself missing my ED...

I genuinely thought that I was passed this, simply because I chose to ignore the signs since they aren't  ""as bad"" as they once were.

What do you guys think? Am i still in it?

She asked me if I was eating properly and I just told her that I was playing basketball.
Just needed to get out of that situation, so yep.
But it's pretty alarming that she's noticed, uuuughhhh I hate her.
Just let me be.
I'm so fucking fat, I feel like driving ten knives in my stomach.
Sometimes, when I feel horrible(most of the time) I take a pair of scissors and lightly snip the very surface skin of my stomach.
Every night, it is a rule for me to go to bed hungry.
It's not that I don't eat at all, I just eat a little less.
I have quarter cup of oatmeal for breakfast, half a fruit for mid snack, cuz I don't want anyone in my class to think that I'm starving/dieting, even though many have asked me already. I eat half of what my mom packs for lunch, and sometimes, I skip the mid snack and eat that fruit for lunch. I make my friend, who is very skinny, but never ever ever ever puts on weight to eat my lunch. She lovesmy mom's food, and so she finishes it. Then I come back home and tell my mom that I'm too full to eat and directly have dinner. I have half the amount of dinner I usually have and load up on vegetables in my dinner instead of the blatant carbs she makes me eat.
I can calculate calories mentally and if it touches 700-800 I flip. I love it when I'm 500 or below.

&amp;#x200B;

so i'm an 18 year old, 154cm female and in Oct 2018, i was 75kg and i decided to do something about it. i decided to to start eating 700kcal everyday to lose weight. my goal  was 55kg and it was working. it was fine because i wasn't starving and i never truly denied myself food. if i was feeling really hungry, i would eat something. i weighed myself everyday and recorded it. i started purging at the beginning of Dec 2018 but i would only purge when i eat something super unhealthy like chicken and chips. everything was fine. i would only purge maybe once every 1 or 2 months.  it hit March, i was 60kg and i hit a plateau where i fluctuated between 60-61kg for a month. i was so angry at my body for doing this when i was so close to my goal. i didn't eat more than 300kcal for about 5 days, my body finally responded and i started losing weight. after that plateau, my purging got more frequent so i would throw up normal 300-500kcal meals. but still, it wasn't that bad, it was only once a week or so. i started purging at school, restaurant toilets, practically anywhere that had a toilet. i never thought i had a problem though. i just thought of it as damage control. 

i reached my 55kg goal in May 2019 and i stopped counting calories and weighing myself everyday but i wasn't happy with my body at all. i would still purge and it was almost everyday. i would have about 250kcal at school (2 energy drinks &amp; crisps), have dinner and then throw up dinner. i would still snack after, i just couldn't hack full meals, i'm not sure why. but i had a fundamental rule that i would never throw up breakfast. i have no idea where that rule came from but i stuck to it religiously so my body had some sustenance. i got down to about 51kg and the summer holidays came about. i still had breakfast and snacks everyday and i would still throw up but not as frequently and definitely not everyday. i still disliked my body but i didn't think about it that much. 

school started again in Sep 2019 and maybe a week into school i decided to stop eating crisps at lunch as i started to dislike my body more and it was on my mind more often. so i was back to having two energy drinks at school everyday - one for breakfast &amp; one for lunch. everything and i mean everything i ate other than those came back up. i wouldn't keep anything down. i still had my breakfast rule so to get around that, i stopped eating breakfast on weekends. i cut my lunch energy drink out and soon i cut my breakfast one too. i got down to 48kg at the end of September and hit another plateau so i ate 700kcal for 2 days to boost my metabolism and gained 0.4kg. i cried so much and decided that i would simply not eat above 250kcal and whatever did would come right back up. i got out of my plateau on the 8th Oct.

today is the 19th Oct 2019 and i weighed in at 44.1kg. i'm 18, 154cm and my BMI is 18.6. i hate my body more than anything. all i see is fat, fat and more fat. i'm terrified of food and i'm terrified of gaining weight. i average 150kcal everyday. i wake up thinking about food &amp; weight and i fall asleep thinking about food &amp; weight. i'm constantly hungry and i watch food shows religiously to curb my hunger. my throat aches and my hand is bruised from purging 2/3 times a day. i'm always cold, i'm always dizzy, i have no energy and my body aches. i'm in my last year of school and instead of focusing on my studies, i'm focused on calories. i'm so tired of my life revolving around food and i hurt from forcing myself to throw up a 46kcal biscuit. deep down, rationally, i know i can't gain 3kg from eating cereal or a sandwich or a cookie but i'm still so terrified. my parents &amp; friends are getting worried so i hide more &amp; more. i wear gloves to cover my purging scars and i isolate myself in my room to avoid food. as soon as i wake up, i've planned what i'm eating for that day. i weigh myself 4/5 times a day and i freak out if the scale goes up by 0.1kg at any time during the day. i'm so fixated on bodies and whenever i see someone slimmer than me, i feel so disgusted at myself. i've tried to eat normally and keep food down but i can't even keep lettuce down. i feel so uncomfortable whenever there's anything in my stomach. i'm starting to fear drinking because my body might hold onto the water and cause me to gain weight. i don't know how to get out of this. i don't want to eat or gain weight but i'm so tired of feeling this way. i know i'm not obese but that's what i see whenever i look at my body.

1783,1783,eating_disorders,"Hey guys, 

so I've had a restrictive eating disorder and I'm currently recovering from it. My weight is healthy. I'm finally eating enough calories to gain weight at a slow pace or at least not lose any, even though I still have many ""sick"" thought patters (e.g. if I'm not working out for several days, I'll start restricting myself because I'll get fat,etc.) 

Anyways, I've been feeling a lot better ever since I started eating better, however, I feel like ever since I've had my eating disorder, I've become a lot more serious and disinterested in social interactions. 

I used to be a ""silly"" person who enjoyed interacting with others and do stupid stuff, but now, I feel like everything I do must bring me forward some way or another and when  I go out with friends, it feels like a chore - I feel like I'm wasting my time. I went from like a laid-back, social person to someone who's uptight, introverted with no emotions.

The only things that bring me joy at the moment are lifting weights, doing BJJ, getting good grades, my family and eating. I really don't care about my friends or pretty much anything else at the moment. I didn't use to be like that.

1784,1784,eating_disorders,"This happened several years ago, when I was 15 and recovering for the first time. I was in an outpatient program where a therapist would visit me at home every Monday. She asked me to write down everything I ate, for every meal of the day, every week, and then we would go through it together. 

I wasn’t on any meal plan, and I had to figure out by myself what to eat. Now, one of my safe foods during my early recovery was yoghurt. It was a part of almost every meal, sometimes with oatmeal, fruit, next to a sandwich, etc. This was also during my extreme hunger period, so I would eat fairly big amounts of food. 

When going through my food diary, she pointed out that I was “eating too much” and that “yoghurt has a lot of sugar in it and that’s not healthy”. Now, I see how that’s something you would point out to someone who doesn’t have problems with food. But it devastated me, hearing I was eating too much. 

The result was me only eating two plain slices of bread for each meal the following week, which she then obviously pointed out as too little. The whole thing was just incredibly confusing and frustrating.

1794,1794,eating_disorders,"I can’t figure out what I should say because I feel like there is so much so I’m just gonna explain some events that transpired some weeks ago

My mother and I went to dinner before my ballet class. It was a diner populated heavily by the elderly and famous for having the best pie. I can’t remember what I ate previously that day but I remember ordering some type of club sandwich because all of the salads looked horribly unappetizing and cheap. Obviously it shouldn’t matter anyways. It came with a small french onion soup. I ate a lot of bread and crackers that were complementary, devoured my soup, but could only peck at my full plate when it arrived. I could feel my stomach stretch against my dance leotard and shorts. My body felt bloated and horrible and I wanted the food to be gone and at the same time let loose and eat as much as I possibly could as I was at a restaurant, something that happens not too often because of how poor I am. I opened up to my mom about how I’ve been struggling lately with my eating. I want to restrict so bad. I am, but not as much as I would like and still maintain my binging habits. I don’t like talking to my mother about these things, for a multitude of reasons as you might find out one way or another, but I was in such a needy position I needed to tell someone how I was doing, hoping to be met with comments saying that they have noticed and are worried because I am losing weight (I didn’t get any).

There is no point in telling about our brief and lowly conversation so I am just going to jump to the bit when we are in the car, on our way to drop me off. My mom brings back up hospitalization and I say that I don’t want to go back. I’ve been on three separate occasions in the past 8 months all for depression, anxiety, and then ED. I get upset because I feel like whenever I struggle my family just wants to throw me back in.

I chew on a tooth pick from the restaurant and, after some silence, say “I’m not going back. I don’t even look sick.”

With my last words my face contorted into a horrible figure and I started to sob like a child, the tooth pick hanging limply in my mouth. My mom parks in the usual spot and listens to me scream and sob for a good 10 minutes straight, without any words. I tell her that I feel horrible. I’m not anorexic. That is my main fixation. I remember screaming and crying at the ED program that “I get an eating disorder and I can’t even lose the weight. I get the one that makes me ugly. I wish that if this was gonna happen then I at least got the one that would make me beautiful. I couldn’t even do that right. I couldn’t even lose the weight.”

I restrict and binge and eat normally and cycle through it constantly, tearing myself apart from the second I wake up to the very last moments before I go to sleep.

My mother tries to get me to go to dance and tells me that it will make me feel better but I won’t stop screaming and shaking and crying. I can’t remember how long its been but my mom gets me out of the car and I can’t even walk. My legs hurt and tingle and my mom has to hold me up and escort me down the city to the building. But the closer we get the more my legs and ankles hurt and when we are just outside the door I start crying again. I can’t think about looking in the mirror at myself with all those other girls that are skinnier than me. I can’t stand the thought of acting like nothing happened when I feel so horrible and sad.

It’s been 7 months now and we are doing great with money and live in a wonderful apartment but the both of us are clinging on to old habits.

We only eat once a day, and if we try to eat more we can’t and feel sick. We feel hungry all day but have no desire or motivation to eat. 

My boyfriend works late hours so what we’ll do is wait till he gets home which is around 5pm and that will be our first meal of the day, we used to at least order huge meals so we could take in our days worth of food in one sitting but recently We can’t even finish our one meal. I don’t think either of us have finished a dinner in at least a month now. 

Last week my friend brought up that she was concerned for our well being and that we looked skinny and that we are basically starving ourselves.we never really even thought about us having an issue and I still don’t think we have an eating disorder but I’d like to hear peoples opinion.

So basically, we aren’t eating until late hours of the day/night and when we are eating we are either shoving it down our throats or picking at it.

learning how to teach your mother (47F) how not to trigger you, (even though she had an eating disorder most of her life but is very HAPPILY MOVED ON AND RECOVERED), is the hardest most emotionally draining thing in my life right now. we are extremely close, and she’s there for me through anything. i mostly hide the severity of it because i don’t want to hear it from her, or hurt/worry her. but she knows about my disorder and today i had a bad day. so i call my mom. i have this long ass conversation about how i don’t like when she says “if you don’t eat i’ll order you delivery right now” or “have you eaten today?” “will you go eat?” “you need to eat something” “you’d feel better if you would eat” etc

like i get she’s my mom and she cares. i get that, she’s not doing anything wrong, but fuck dude. when she compliments my appearance and i just flatly say “okay mom” and she says “oh come ON, you KNOW you’re GORGEOUS” and i have to say, “actually no mom, i don’t. and i don’t want to think/hear about my appearance. i think about it enough.” and she says she understands. she gets it.  she’s going to work on it. i have to stay open with her, she says. i think the call ends on a decent note. 

shortly after on Facebook, she reposts something that says, word for word, “Diet Tip: if you think you’re hungry. you might just be thirsty. Have a bottle of wine first, and see how you feel.”

again, it’s not my mother fault. but this shit makes me want to jump off a fucking cliff. like i feel so misunderstood, it’s insane. how could the person i am the closest to in this world, not see me clear enough? where does that leave me?? what is my future going to be like?

i’m going to a (new) therapist in the morning tomorrow. 
i hope he makes me feel better.

— friends, there’s a very, very high chance that i’m going to have to go inpatient soon for my eating disorder. just in the worst headspace i’ve ever been, and it’s consumed me. i just want to know that i’m not a lost fucking cause, even if i’m not ready to enter full recovery right now. 
i just want to feel better. 

advice? please share how your experience with disordered eating has affected your family/personal life.

Lately, I have been very stressed out with school, work, and my friends' drama. Unlike most people who stress-eat, I find it extremely hard to eat anything if I am stressed. In my current friend group, there isn't anyone who was with me when this was happening, I have only mentioned it in passing and I'm sure no one even remembers me saying it.  

Today at 17:00 (5 pm) I just realized that I had not eaten since last night (around 18:30 (6:30)) and went to go make food but the entire time I was getting ""this is wrong"" signals from my brain.

1810,1810,eating_disorders,"TL;DR my mom, god love her, is making me worse, too fat, wanna die, can't stop my problems and idk what to do.(crap description but ok)

I am 26(f) btw, just to preface, and we supoort eachother financially so I cant leave even if i wanted to.

This is a mix of (potential ED?) and other things but I just can't handle this anymore.

My mother, is a fantastic mother, but I am morbidly obese (300+ lbs, been 200+ since high school) and she doesn't know how to cook for 2 people. Only a full family. Ever since my dad died she has only had myself and her. She has a PLETHORA of health issues and barely eats anything. I can cook, but don't often as it makes me feel gross or I end up making dinner for us, and she doesn't eat. (Or i cook like her and make enough for a family of 3 or 4)

I have an issue(s) of eating nothing until I feel like passing out, bored eating, stress eating, binge eating, depressed/emotional eating, purging after eating, all of the eating issues. I used to and sometimes still do, view food as a reward when I do certain things. Other times I use food as what it is, just to keep me from passing out and staying somewhat alive. Other times I just want to puke thinking about food.

99% of the time, nothing sounds good food wise and I feel sick thinking about eating. When I can eat, often times its unhealthy because of my stomach issues and eating healthy makes my stomach/bowel issues flare up. 

Anyway, this brings me to the issue my mom and I have. Example, tonight..she made fried chicken, homemade mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. The chicken pieces are HUGE(breasts) and i grabbed one, a bunch of sprouts and a fair amount of potatoes. I ate very little chicken , all of my potatoes and sprouts and shes giving me hell for not eating all of my food. Bare in minde these split chicken breasts are THE SIZE OF MY HEAD AT LEAST. I felt sick and full right when I started eating and about to vomit like 5 min before i stopped.

I told her, i need to stop eating when im full and she interrupted me mid sentence saying ""i know what youre about to say, you always say it"" and im upset and feel like i want to throw up everything and hurt myself (selfharm via the standard method y'all may be familiar with)

I straight up told her earlier, my health issues, mostly my weight, are stressing me out. I have an EMG on the 15th and i already know what they're gonna say. She says if it ends up involving surgery they wont operate cause im too fat. I cant lose weight. Ive tried. Every fucking way i can think of and it always comes back and then some. Also, you cant exercise like you want to when youre in too much pain to even walk.

I told her i legitimately will just kill myself if this continues because I cant handle it anymore. She tells me to shut the fuck up and i retort with she doesnt understand. She says she does she used to be 230lbs. Im like WHOOP DEE FUCKING DOO! IM OVER 300LBS AND 5FT 4.5IN IM GONNA DIE! Add that plus mental illness being untreated because i cant find something affordable and I have a full time job, no you DONT fucking understand and you're making it SO MUCH WORSE.


Anyway, thats a long winded summary of whats happening and rn i just wanna throw up. Im so sick to my stomach.

1820,1820,eating_disorders,"Hey,

I just wanted to share my experience. Maybe it will help someone.. idk.

First I would like to say that I haven't shared this with ANYONE. Its been a secret for a very long time.

I always ate whatever I wanted. As a kid you don't have to worry about calories, your inner thigh fat, or how people look at your body in general. I was so  care free. My strained relationship with food began when I entered Pre-k. I got picky and didn't want to eat things I thought would ""make me fat"". I developed a very irrational fear of gaining weight which made me depressed. The first time anyone ever called me fat was in 2nd grade. I remember exactly how it happened . We were in reading circle, and my friend at the time was sitting next to me. I remember he stared at me and then, at my stomach. He poked it and said ""why are you fat"". the sudden rush of emotions I had never felt before filled me. Anger, guilt, sadness. I remember wanting to cry but I just couldn't. This was all just the beginning.

Middle school came around and I noticed I didn't look like other girls. The preppy, popular girls in my grade had skinny thighs and small waists . I looked down at my own thighs and saw the difference. (my thighs were very muscular) I became obsessed over thigh gaps. 

I started restricting freshman year. I also went through a binge phase as well but not as heavy. I remember going to get my physical, my doctor came in and looked at me with a scared look. I had lost 11 lbs in only one month. I pretended to be confused but internally I was so happy.  

Sophomore year is when I started purging. I don't remember much from it. all I remember was being so sad, so sick, and in need of medical help. nothing was ever the same. 

My main source of ""thinspo"" was Brandy Melville. They made skinny look beautiful. they made skinny look healthy. they made skinny look perfect. I was instantly obsessed.

Now I realize how extremely toxic it is for young girls to see stuff like that in the media. It screwed with my head and made me believe I was doing something healthy when I would starve myself for days. It made me believe that I was going to die alone and ugly if I didn't start to lose weight. It broke relationships, friendships, and most importantly it broke me.

1822,1822,eating_disorders,"So for 3 years I was in this in between recovery type phase. Then kinda solid recovery about a year. 

Idk why it picked back up, but I have been restricting the past couple weeks. Not terribly but that's how this starts with me. I kinda ease back into it until I'm down to like 350cal a day, barely functioning.. 

So I told my therapist. And then I started to feel this urge to 'prove it'. Like, if I'm telling someone it should be real, otherwise I'm just attention seeking or trying to seem more interesting and complex or whatever. I hate this 'you aren't really sick' type feeling. I hate the doubting the validity of my experience with eating disorders. 

But tbh. I miss it. I miss the preoccupation, the (albeit fleeting) satisfaction of weight loss, the aesthetic (as dumb as that sounds).. 

I feel so immature, like I heavy weight don't wanna post this. My mind keeps racing and I can't keep up. One minute I'm thinking ""hmm.. maybe I should not do this, maybe I should stay in recovery.""

1833,1833,eating_disorders,"Last year I was a junior in college and really struggled with my weight, and constantly feeling anxious about eating more than 800-900 calories a day. I lost around 25 pounds in this time, and would sometimes stand in the kitchen and do jumping jacks or sit ups to burn off extra calories or before I let myself eat. I felt really out of control. I had a therapist at the time for other unrelated  things I had been dealing with, and we came up with a plan and talked a lot about it. I got back to eating pretty normally, though i did still skip meals here and there in order to cut calories. It took me a long time to stop worrying about or counting my calories. 
I gained most of the weight back and wasn’t happy, but felt that it wasn’t as big of a deal as I felt it was before.

Well—school just started again, and I am really right back at counting my calories, and restricting, and feeling uncomfortable if I’m not hungry. I am terrified of what I’m doing to my body, but I am TERRIFIED of gaining weight. I want to be skinny.

I don’t know what to do, because my therapist does not specialize in eating disorders, and I don’t know how to find someone that does without my parents finding out. 

Also—I feel really guilty because sometimes this almost feels like a choice. I knew if I let myself start restricting again I would become obsessed with it, but I almost wanted that to happen.

1845,1845,eating_disorders,"Hey, first of all I want to apologize if I have any mistake, if something is incomprehensible, let me know.

I am a 16 years old who’s been dealing with eating disorders since I was 12. I always end relapsing, through all those years, when I am healthy and I think I am happy with myself, I feel bad again and I start having all these behaviors that make me relapse, but I think this time is worse. 

Usually happens this: I see myself fat and I start restricting or fasting for days, then I eat something (like a normal meal) and I feel the need to purge (luckily now it’s been two weeks without doing it) and I feel miserable, so I go back to restricting. This has been happening all the summer. Also I know I use all this restricting thing to make myself feel better: if I have any problem, starve myself makes me feel better and like it is going to solve all my problems.

It’s complicated because I was discharged from my treatment in May, and I‘ve been in a healthy weight for a while, but I’ve noticed I am having some symptoms (my hair is falling a lot, I tremble, I feel dizzy almost all the time...). But I don’t know what I can do, I don’t feel like I am “sick enough”, I’ve lost only 6 kilos, but I know something’s wrong with me.

I’ve tried to talk with my mom about this recently, but she doesn’t really understand it, and I am kinda scared of myself, because I know this behavior can get worse.

My parents thought I left the house this morning and I heard them saying I looked pretty In an Instagram photo I posted and then my mom saying yeah that dsnt rlly mean anything she’ll be pretty again if she looses ten pounds it doesn’t take that long hopefully she keeps it up. I confronted them a little later on and they told me I took it out of context and that they just want me to be confident and I’m so pretty and blah blah and they both cried. I feel really grossed out that they talk but more importantly think like that. I feel like the biggest fear in recovery is the weight gain and everyone looking at you differently but every therapist says it’s in your head no one cares and your physical appearance isn’t important and it was rlly scary to hear my own parents talking about me like that.

1848,1848,eating_disorders,"I’m a 21 year old male been dealing with an ED after losing weight by keto, it started by me throwing up if I ate over my daily calorie intake, I made the habit of over calculating my calories so I would just throw up to be on the safe side. I started doing this 2-3 times a week to the point I was doing it everyday 4/5 times. My goal was never  to become stick thin i just wanted to maintain my weight loss i was miserable when I was overweight 

I deal with depression and anxiety and I tend to go through periods where I deal with low moods, withdrawal  from life in general I tend to stay in my room all day. I hardly eat anything and live off chocolate and snacks and a microwave meal lol (consuming less than 1400 calories) as I don’t have the energy to cook i know what I’m doing as well I restrict on purpose I find the hunger euphoric. 

I first did this in January lost a lot of weight but I developed IBS as a result of this and it’s hindered my life ever since, I would purge more frequently as I was scared to keep certain foods in my stomach.

I decided I would stop purging in may 2019 I knew I had a problem, I stopped purging for 3 weeks and when I checked my scale I had gained 15 pounds. I went into panic mode I felt betrayed by my body, I intended to get better but felt crushed that within such a short space I had gained so much weight. My stomach symptoms became bad as well so I decided I would just go back to being restrictive (consuming less than 1700). I did this for 7 weeks, a week ago I started noticing feeling extreme cold, pins and needles, chest pain, dizziness, weakness and overall pain in bones and joints. When I checked the scale I had lost 30 pounds and for the first time I was underweight. Ive been losing weight for over a year but never hit such a low weight before. 

I decided I would start eating again and it’s been 6 days, im consuming on average 3500-4500 calories a day, I’m literally lost i don’t know what I’m doing I read stuff online each having differing views. I know weight gain is necessary right now but at this rate in less than a week I’ve gained 5kg, I hope to gain a further 4kg ( 5’8 55kg want to get to 60kg) 


Also would I even be considered anorexic considering I was literally underweight for 2-3 weeks?

1849,1849,eating_disorders,"My disordered eating is currently the worst it's been in my entire life. I've never felt more consumed by it. My every waking thought involves food, calories, and ways i can burn more of them. I've struggled with it for years in secret. I've always been either classified as normal weight or overweight according to my bmi so it's never been that obvious. I go in cycles of bingeing, fasting, and restriction and have been since i was a young teen, I just turned 22. As a teen I used to self harm whenever I binged or overate and even though I don't hurt myself in that way anymore, this is the worst I've ever been. I was able to maintain roughly the same weight for years through this exhausting cycle, but as of recently it's been a steady restriction and this Summer alone I've lost almost 40lbs. I'm at the lowest weight I've ever been in my life and I've never felt worse. I look in the mirror and all I see is the all the weight I still need to lose. I've completely fooled everyone into thinking that I'm losing it all with a healthy diet and with my gym membership, but it's all bullshit. No one would probably believe the truth anyway which is one of the reasons i don't seek help.

 The only time I ever time told anyone that there was something wrong with me was 2 years ago; I broke down in front of my now ex and confessed to him crying one night that I thought I was suffering from an ed. In that moment for the first time I truly  wanted help for my personal struggle and thought I'd be met with his sympathy and ears so I could finally confess to him the habits and rituals that consume me and have been for years and he could push me to seek help. He laughed like it was a joke because at the time I was overweight and going through extreme bingeing cycles in secret. I felt so completely embarrassed and still do looking back at it. He changed the subject and told me instead what he thought was wrong with me. That relationship is over now and I try not to think of him and the other problems he caused me, but I have never tried again to seek help. These past couple months have been so rough I had to go part time at work to try and cope with my issues, including of course my lovely eating problems. I just got home from work not too long ago and binged for the first time in a while. I feel so awful. I tried to throw up, but I never have been able to purge so I'm currently just trying to distract myself with youtube videos and other stuff just to ignore how bad i feel about what I just did. I hate this feeling. I hate bingeing. I hate restricting. I hate being consumed by my weight 24/7. But now feel like I'm in too deep. I wish I could be normal.

1853,1853,eating_disorders,"So my whole life, my eating habits have been weird af. I eat super slow for some reason (around 35 to 60 minutes for a well-balanced, healthy meal that has fruits, vegetables, and milk at least). Now this may not sound too bad, but when you’ve been like this since you were born and school typically allows for 30 minute lunches, this becomes kinda severe. Not to mention how barely anyone can wait for you. In addition, I’m a really picky eater and have a below average appetite I believe. 

So what has this lead to? Well, I’m in undergrad and I’m pretty short for a male my age. Additionally, I get sick easily, such as the common cold and digestive issues (although those can be explained by other causes perhaps). To top this off, my family always gets on my ass for this; a lot of the times when I eat with my family, they’re always telling me to hurry up and telling me the consequences of eating so damn slow (e.g. less time to study). I understand why my family acts this way; I agree with them but the problem is no matter how hard I try, there’s no way I can eat quicker than like 35 minutes for a well-balanced, healthy meal. Sadly, my family thinks I can improve and be like most ppl but I honestly don’t think I can unless I specifically change my behavior somehow (other than trying to eat faster, I choose foods that I find tastier so I naturally eat them faster). I’m kinda screwed if I can’t find a solution for this since I’m sure the professional world doesn’t always allocate around 45 minutes to simply finish a meal (this doesn’t include cooking or cleaning up). 

I think I might have over sensitive taste buds as I can eat certain foods like eggs quickly but most of those foods are unhealthy and there’s honestly not too many foods I like. I also noticed I have an enhanced gag reflex, like when I have a certain food on my tongue for too long, I want to vomit. I suspect the length of my eating is just due to the fact I’m a slow person in general, but I’m not sure about that. I’m pretty sick and tired of this.

Like 13 kg in 3 years. In my background being even a little bit chubby is immediately a reason to be made fun of. Or maybe it's just my hella insecure mind. Nevermind. Now I've finally started to loose weight. But the costs are horrendous. I almost repeated final year of high school, became hikikomori (cheers to anime watchers), and partially damaged my gastrointestinal system. Just for - 10kg in two months. 

Was it worth it? Thinking rationally - hell no!
But to my wretched mind it's HELL YEAH

Now for the past week I was on vacation in Italy. And you know what? I FUCKING LOVE ITALIAN FOOD
So you know, I was kinda binging on literally everything. I purged for a few times, but it's not enough. Have I mentioned before, that I'm hella bulimic? If not, then now you know lmao

I feel so fucking guilty r/n, I wanna purge but I'm in the car and I can't pretend that I suffer from travel sickness cause I never did. I'll be home in like 2 hours but it's to late and I'm kinda freaking out cause I feel so fat and dirty. And despite loosing all the weight I can't see any difference In my body, it's still just the same pile of a fat shit.

I know I should be looking for help and I really wanna recover. Just not now. Not until my eating disorder does its job and makes me skinny. Makes me beautiful. Makes me worth being healthy.

I'm aware that my thoughts are so freaking unhealthy, but I just have to let it out. I just wanna cry and I can't, but that's another long palabra

1860,1860,eating_disorders,"My mother has fought her weight her whole life. She admits in attempting to ""save"" me she helped screw me up. I became overweight at 10 with such comments as ""are you sure you're still hungry?"" So naturally I went through the emotional ups and downs of being over weight through middle school, highschool, ect... I didn't lose the weight until I was 29. Lots of obsessing, lots of dieting. Before my first marriage at 31 I counted calories strictly, got in my 10000 steps a day and weighed myself morning and night freaked out if I didn't do everything right. It got me to 130 which was my lowest adult weight, my highest being 240. A couple years later I got a stomach infection and gained 30 pounds back. I never really stopped having a diet mentality. I've lost 10  of those pounds in the last couple months but I think it's because I haven't been eating  enough. I'm pretty sure I have IBS and they put me on a gluten free diet the last couple weeks to see if I have a gluten intolerance. So naturally I'm trying to do everything perfect and I know I'm not eating enough but I've had stomach issues so long I'm almost afraid of all food. I know how many calories is in just about everything. I've read all the diet books and I have more information in my head then I know what to do with so I can never stick with an eating style because i always think something will be better. 

Anyway after being gluten free, low far and an attempt at high fiber a couple weeks I'm losing my shit. I dont know what to eat, when, how, do I drink when I eat, do I not eat rice, I don't think I'm getting enough nutrients and I just want to enjoy food again without knowing every benefit and downside to it.

1862,1862,eating_disorders,"I’m 16F and I’ve been struggling with anorexic and orthorexic behaviors for almost three years now. This past year, I’ve started to develop some bulimic behaviors now, too, and I know it’s starting to take a toll on my body even though I haven’t been purging for long. I also train intensely at a martial arts school 3-4 days a week, and sometimes go to a HIIT gym. I’ve only opened up to one person about my past behaviors, and that’s an ex-boyfriend. 

I recently told a close friend of mine about my bulimia, and she’s trying her best to help me, but I can’t bring myself to be completely honest with her. Part of me knows what I’m doing is bad, and that I need to stop. But another part of me keeps holding me back.


In the past, my mother has pointed out that I don’t eat much or I need to eat more, and that I need to stop being so obsessive with food/not eating etc. Because I’ve been eating relatively normally and purging, it’s less noticeable and she hasn’t said anything. She asked me months ago if I was purging, but I told her no.

I know I need to open up to my parents soon and start going to therapy or treatment, but my question is: how? When should I approach my parents? What should I say?

1865,1865,EatingDisorderHope,"So I’m a junior and I’m trying to work with online school and my eating disorder mentality (I only say that because I do not commonly starve myself, at least before quarantine started, but I do think about it a lot and personally I find my body disgusting) has already been really bad since quarantine and my self image has gone absolutely down the drain so the thought of starving myself has not become uncommon to me and for a while now I’ve noticed that I think like this a lot when I’m angry at myself and when I’m stressed (I don’t only feel like this during those times but they do happen during this times). So I have a fuck ton of work to do and most of it is due tomorrow so I decided to pull an all nighter so I can get all of my work done and like a dumbass I fell asleep at around 12 AM… It is now 6 PM and all of my teachers office hours are closed and my math tutor isn’t available till tomorrow so I basically just royally fucked myself over by sleeping and I’m mad at myself right now and I’m so stressed and now I don’t want to eat for two days. Doesn’t help that my mom just threw a fit at me (which I may post about in the raised by narcissists subreddit). I was accidentally a shitty friend to one of my friends and I just feel awful and like an awful person. I know it sounds incredibly stupid but its just kind of how I feel when I’m stressed and/or angry at myself and when I fuck up a lot. I feel like it may be sort of a “you don’t deserve food because you’re a shitty fucking person who fucks up a lot” and plus once I already feel self-hatred over one thing that will start to deep into other things and then next time I look in the mirror I just think about how disgusting my body is. I don’t know what to do about this because I legit don’t think I’ll be able to eat later and it doesn’t help that I’ve been particularly feeling like shit about my body more recently. So my question is, is this normal for like anyone else also how do some of you deal with this kind of stuff because I don’t really know how to deal with this?

1873,1873,EatingDisorderHope,"My mother sent me to therapy for suspected anorexia when I was in middle school. I insisted i didn’t finish my packed lunches because she packed me bruised apples and expired yogurt. I believed this myself. But what if I was lying to myself? It wasn’t until college that I found myself with weird eating habits. I didn’t like going to the dining hall because eating around people made me very very anxious. For about a week during “finals” I ate nothing but lettuce with vinegar and pickles. When my general anxiety gets bad and then subsides I feel a need to eat and I usually end up eating and eating until my stomach kills. 

I started working out with my partner a few months ago. He does bulks and cuts, increasing his food for a few months in order to gain muscle and then diets for a few months to lose the fat and show off the new muscle. For those not familiar it is common practice in the fitness world. When I started working out my appetite increased naturally and I gained 10lbs in 2 months. This scared the hell out of me and I quickly stopped exercising and tried to control my diet which only led to more anxiety and binge nights which is where I am now. With corona going on I feel trapped with this realization that I have a problem but no one to reach out to. Therapists aren’t taking on new clients when we aren’t allowed to leave our houses. 

With my anxiety I know tips and tricks to calm myself down since it’s something I’ve dealt with most of my life but I have no idea how to start dealing with my eating on my own and my partner isn’t helping when he says I don’t need to lose weight, that I’m beautiful.

1874,1874,EatingDisorderHope,"I have been fighting ED's for over 10 years now, first diagnosed with anorexia (9-13y) and once I started to balance my eating again, I was diagnosed with body dysmorphia(14-19y). 

I was in a relationship for 5 years that really really did not help, he would cheat with numerous people and when I asked why he did it, he would give me a list of all the things I was doing wrong, most of the list was my appearance, for example, my legs were too long, he wanted me to dye my hair brown, etc. 

Since then I moved to university and found someone amazing, he is truly incredible and makes me feel like I can finally be myself without the fear of him running off with other people. However, with the virus outbreak we can't see each other, and probably won't for 6 months. This has completely thrown me out of routine, and I do feel myself starting to creep into bad habits, hiding foods, skipping meals, calorie counting, weighing myself after every meal, etc.

1876,1876,EatingDisorderHope,"I know that I have a lot of wonky thoughts about food, as well as body dysmorphia. I feel like I’m being unfair to my husband. But I know that him being around me is making me not want to eat. TLDR at the bottom.

My husband is a lot chubbier now than when we got married. When we got married he was very slim, actually. He worked abroad for a year after we got married and we really only started living together this month. While working abroad he gained a good deal of weight. When he gains weight he gets a back hump &amp; loses his neck/chin entirely. I am no longer attracted to him although I still love him very much. It doesn’t help that he gains weight in his lower body in the exact same way that the man who abused me when I was a teenager does - basically when he’s on top of me and I feel his body, I get flashbacks to being raped again. It sucks and it’s 100% not his fault. 

He hates his weight gain and talks frequently about getting fit again. He used to be a boxer and a surfer and hates being unfit &amp; feeling unhealthy. I’m trying o support him in this as best I can. He really is a wonderful guy and I want him to be healthy and happy. 

The issue, however, is that he is not eating healthy or exercising at all. I try not to enable him and I work out regularly and eat healthy (at the beginning of quarantine we snacked a lot because it felt like vacation, and we were bored trapped inside) but when I see him eating constantly it disgusts me and in “retaliation” (this is an emotional response, not a logical one, I know it’s stupid) I don’t eat. I’m skipping meals for days in a row. When I go to eat something and he sees me do so, he always eats too and eats WAY more than he needs to. I can’t snack without him snacking double. When I try to get him to exercise he gives up halfway and I work out extra long and hard in order to... guilt him? Punish myself? I don’t know why I’m having these impulses. 

I lived with an abusive man for two years (I left because he was going to kill me if I stayed. Very violent). He was also fat, complained about being fat, and did nothing about it. Where these men differ is: my abuser would shame me for my body and call it/me “disgusting” very frequently. I know a lot of my current disordered eating is coming from trauma brain.

1879,1879,EatingDisorderHope,"I’ve been struggling with bulimia for about a decade and have owned up to it to my parents and begun to seek treatment in the past couple years.  

My problem is with my parents. I am consistently feeling like because I’m not ‘too skinny’ that they don’t take it seriously and it’s really taking a toll on me and has caused major setbacks in my recovery. I am consistently being pushed to exercise as a ‘way to help my depression and anxiety’ but when I explain that it only makes me feel worse and more like they’re ashamed of my weight, I get told that I’m making everyone feel like they have to walk on egg shells. 

Tonight really upset me because we all got together to watch a movie and my mom had bought junk food. Everyone was eating it and it was actually going fine until my mom announced that this was a one night thing and she was back on track tomorrow. Then she broadened it to say we all were. I tried to clarify that she can’t control what her adult children eat. It was a flippant comment. She said that she could, especially if they live in her house. I honestly hoped it was a joke and point blank said that she couldn’t, she again said she could. 

I honestly wish they would walk on egg shells. I wish I’d been caught as a young teenager so they would’ve been forced to research what to do. Instead I feel so alone and ashamed and can’t stop crying knowing that if I even bring it up again I’ll be made to feel like a drama queen or that I’m trying to make other people feel bad over one comment.

1887,1887,EatingDisorderHope,"I’m not really sure how to go about this. My SO suggested reddit and this is my first post because I am not really able to process my thoughts and feelings about what I have been going through and the communities here seem to be great for getting some advise. 

I am 25 years old and I have been struggling to get past the vicious addiction to binge eating and purging periods during vigorous diet and exercise routines that have been ongoing for about three years now. 

I want to say it started upon medical discharge from the military before I could even begin my career in the armed forces. Not sure if depression of having to return to normal life set in at that time, but I was no longer in control of things as I had felt back then. I got home and felt like all of my hard work and healthy habits were in vain, and began to binge eat on things I had restricted so heavily before I left to basic training. 

Two years later I am still in this loop, continuously worrying every moment of every day about calories, carbs (BIG one for me), sugars, and processed foods and have this irrational fear of instantaneous weight gain upon ingesting my foods. I know it’s silly and makes no sense at all, but honestly, it’s not something I can shake. Junk food and sweets, for me, is likened to placing a drink in front of an alcoholic. There’s no refraining. 

Often, I will pay large amounts of money on personal training, diet “safe” foods, and will work out like a fiend to make sure I dont gain any weight if not lose MORE weight because I feel obese as it is, but when I go through phases of having binges, it usually stems from one cheat day. And I can’t stop. 

I’m obsessed with my figure, my weight, my fat percentage, and the amount of carbs I take in per day, but when I binge, I can’t stop. I can’t control what I want and guilt kicks in later, and that’s when I purge until my eyes are red and my insides are killing me. It scares me a little because it’s wrong, and I know this, but I can’t stop myself from feeling fat, worthless, disgusting, and insecure enough to compare myself to every female I see during my day. I’m not sure what I should be doing, as insurance has not kicked in for me to seek help as of yet, and I feel like any other resources I have reluctantly tried did not really benefit me or fit in with my busy schedule of work and school. But I know this is holding me back from living my life to its best capacity and moving forward toward the next step of my life, marriage and home life with my SO.

I’m quite chunky right now and my stepmom was telling me I should lose weight and exercise. Well to me she’s just telling me im fat and I should lose weight so I’m not fat anymore.

1894,1894,EatingDisorderHope,"Basically my troubles with eating started way back. I remember trying to make myself sick after seeing a thin girl in year 7. It didnt work. I remember seeing these pro ana sites and wanting to look like that. Now I'm older and evrything has gone down hill. I have not been to school in what seems like nearly a year now, and ever since that my eating habits have gotten very concerning. I started off wanting to lose weight because at school people thought I was fat, and I felt like no one could ever love me. At first I used portion control, then I started counting my calories. I saw all this thinspo and that motivated me, I tried working out and at this time I was eating 1200 calories. I started restricting lower and lower. I discovered diets from the pro ana community and used them for myself. At this point i was not exercising, but my mental health was getting worse and worse. I had my first ""binge"" (I put it in quotations because I have not been diagnosed with anything) in August, I was fasting all day then when I got home I couldnt control myself. That night I felt immense guilt, and truly hated myself. So ever since then ive been restricting and binging. It comes and goes, I can go weeks restricting and losing weight then I binge for ages and destroy my progress. I constantly want to lose weight, and my goal weight is very unhealthy. Right now my mental health is awful, I barely go outside. I've nearly kms twice now, and this week and last week I have been binging everyday until I cant eat anymore. Before this week and last week I restricted very low, and didnt eat. 

So basically I have a horrible relationship with food. I've tried eating healthier and a normal amount but I always end up binging because if I eat more than a certain amount of food I get into this binge mindset.

So, I am looking from some advice. I have been with my girlfriend for about a year now and she has been doing unbelievably well. Eating at least one meal a day, no purging, little snacks here and there. She's considered overweight now that she has gained all of weight back but was considered healthy when she was constantly purging and engaging in her other anorexic habits. However, she was anemic, she would pass out going down the stairs or in the shower and nowhere near healthy. The past couple of days, I have noticed her joining ProAna accounts and posting on them. She also talked about calculating how many calories she can eat per day to loose weight by a certain period of time, which was around 100-200 calories. She's even gone as far as texting some of her old coaches and asking for meanspo in her image. I had a discussion with her about it and she said that she feels better and less crazy when she talks to people in ProAna accounts. That, it boosts her because she hears what she feels about herself aloud. She brought up how hard it is for her to keep food down because it hurts so much, and her frustrations to gaining so much weight back. She said that she loved the feeling of being empty. I am simply looking for something I could do for her to help her. Perhaps make her her favorite foods. I've read that some people use degrading during sex to help with wanting meanspo. I am just worried with her, interacting with people like that who think that weight-shaming is okay to endorse weight-loss, that it will become more than just the comfort of hearing what she feels. I'm worried that it will turn into, they're right, they're so very right and listen to them and then we're back to where we started. I would appreciate any tips, or thoughts, things I should know, just anything really. Perhaps make her her favorite meals when she gets home from work, or take her to our favorite walking spot. Maybe help her graph things out. I'm just not really sure what to do in general. Anything that people with an ED think that people that date them should know or would have been really helpful to them while in a relationship. Thank you.

Spending hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars on supplements?

Struggling with an eating disorder?

Tired of meal prepping?

Frustrated with the same old cycle?

Pissed that you cannot achieve your goals?

Sick of always trying again, and again, and again, and again...
Everything I just described was me.....for years (2011 - 2015). In know the feelings and frustrations. I can empathize with you because I was there for years; thinking that this would never end and I was doomed to live a miserable life. This is NOT true, you can live the life of freedom you envision, yet seems so unrealistic!

I am dedicated to teaching strategies that give YOU this freedom! YOU this freedom! No more fretting about going out because you are afraid of an eating disorder, that food is ""unclean"" or that you will wreck all of your results. No more doing so BS training programs because it is the only way to get fit or be in shape. No more wasting money on supplements that you don't need, are of poor quality, and are a flat out lie.

This is not some get results quick scheme. I am a person just like yourself. What would you do if you could save yourself a couple hundred dollars a month or gain an extra 10 hours a week? Would you go out more with a significant other, learn a new hobby, play with your kids or grandkids. The possibilities are LIMITLESS and I am here to show you how!

“I can’t believe it,” I thought to myself. I had just left a family Christmas party and was not sick from binging nor did I feel the need to punish myself for eating cookies and drinking beer. At that moment, I closed my eyes and smiled realizing the massive journey that began in 2011.

In fall of 2011, as my days of playing high school football began to wind down, I sought to lose weight. I was always fat growing up, but I played offensive line so I accepted it and just lived my life ignoring the teasing. Skipping all the fights and excess details, because my fat kid story is like all the rest.

That didn’t always work, I would find myself in many detentions for fighting with other kids. I was the typical fat kid, I ate everyone’s lunch growing up because…well mom wouldn’t buy that contraband, also known as twinkies. I worked at Dairy Queen in high school too, people talk about the freshman fifteen in college. Well, they should try the DQ 50ish.

However, once football ended the desire to lose weight was much greater as there seemed to be no logical reason to keep it; plus I just started dating this gorgeous girl (way out of my league). So, in the fall of 2011, things began just like everyone else who looks to lose weight. I started to lift weights and do cardio after school. I also began to watch my diet, even a single carrot was an improvement. As the weight loss progressed I became more obsessed with vanity in myself and my physique. The pendulum swing had begun, I went from being a kid who would eat every edible object in a room (including some that weren’t if people were not looking) to someone who you thought was training for the Mr. Olympia.

The transition did not take place overnight, in fact it happened so slowly and gradually that I did not notice the self-centered monster I was creating. As I soaked up information online from bodybuilding sources, I learned about “clean” foods, meal prepping, cardio, and the works. As time progressed, I became more and more focused on my vanity and physique.

I was spending easily in upwards of 40 hours a week, a “full-time” job on my body and it was not because I enjoyed it, it was simply because I wanted abs and the claimed “physique”. I was doing 30 minutes of fasted cardio every day, then I would lift weights 5-6 days a week followed by another 90 minutes of cardio, and lastly my caloric intake was 1800 calories (mind you I am 6’-0”). If you don't believe me watch this or see that.

To make matters worse, when I did sneak a homemade cookie (deemed “unclean” food by the food gods....damn you!), I would just throw my hands in the air like, “Dang it James! You will never have those abs by eating this quote dirty food!” Thus, since mentally I thought I wrecked all past progress, I would proceed to consume all the cookies, a box of sugar cereal, ransack the cupboards for any other source of sugar. Within minutes to an hour, I would consume the caloric intake of a small village. The cycle would then proceed to be placed on repeat like your favorite new song, that never seems to escape your head, except this song lasted 3 long years….restrict, restrict, binge, restrict, restrict, restrict, binge… and the song SUCKED!

During this time, I was trying all kinds of supplements because I thought that was the key to success that I so desperately needed. I could have been admitted into rehab as an addict for supplements. I bought every damn one that was sold protein, creatine, thermogenics, mass gainers, test boosters, pre-workout, etc. I probably boosted Bodybuilding.com’s bottom-line by about 10% during those years. I believed every hyped ad that would read/claim, “add 600% to my bench press” or “get abs in (insert insane short amount of time that is way to unrealistic…unless you’re as gullible as me)”. Still no results though….how could that be?!?

I would then sit down, cry and sulk in my room, thus proceeding to punish myself for these unacceptable results like a toddler who threw a toy at this brother. However, my body had no more to give, but I did not care….I WANTED ABS!!! So, I pushed myself harder and the world further away, more cardio even less food. Oh, and also James no going out with friends or eating at family parties because the food is not up to par for you and your abs.

This would repeat itself every weekend for several years with no end in sight. I tried IIFYM which morphed into If It Fits Your Mouth, I was scared that if I ate a reasonable amount of “normal” food I would blow up and all of my results (which was not much because my body was dead from the diet swings) would go away. I sought help and nothing seemed to work; was this ever going to end?! I thought about grabbing the Remington 870 in my room, loading a deer slug and just end it right there…..

Was there a special moment or turning point for me? No, just as slowly as it seemed to happen, it took me just as long to fix it and I am still not perfect….it is still a thought, but I have found several ways that began the transition and what I do now to conquer my inner-monster. I am still not perfect; it’s still something I battle. I now use it as a joke…I powerlift for pancakes or do deadlifts for doughnuts and other similar silly/stupid phrases to play off the love of food and iron.

This journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want to help other learn from me. Late in 2014 I created my YouTube channel to share my story and these lessons. As of February 2016 I just began publishing videos about the story I detailed above. It took me some time to get the self-confidence and courage to talk publicly about it. Most men, don’t dare to talk about eating disorders even though it’s prominent in the fitness industry due to the promotion of unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyles. I first heard of this issue with women in bikini and figure competitions from Layne Norton, so yes it’s seemed girly. Since, no one else wants to be blunt and upfront I will. I have been teased and ripped up, but I am still standing so not much will phase me at this point.

My channel is small nothing crazy about 60 subscribers and most videos get about 10-20 views within a month of the upload. However this video almost reached 100 views in a week (that’s a PR..PRs are not only in the gym but life too!) and the amount of emails, friend requests on MyFitnessPal, questions, and the skype calls have occurred quicker than I ever expected from total strangers. I will continue to publish more details about my story in the time to follow and answer questions. I am currently in the process of opening a website (the one you are reading) and blog to help others more directly than via YouTube.

In addition, to sharing the “tricks” I learned to kill my binge eating monster and not myself. My first lesson was on supplements: what I learned from research and my experiences. I created a ranking scheme to help explain my point:

Worth The Money

Worth The Money If You Can Afford It

Marketing Scam…RUN!

I also began to only support serious supplement companies. Like 1st Phorm, ones that are reputable, they create honest products, they don’t spike their numbers, and they actually represent what the hell fitness is meant to be. Too many companies are about making a quick buck off the ignorant and uneducated (i.e. ME). They promote fitness as this vanity thing, like abs are the key to happiness. That people with abs are better than you. Let me tell you…that’s crap!! Fitness is not about looks, it’s about changing who you are from the inside...not the out. After this whole experience, I stand by that claim!

I am now proud to say I am a USAPL competitor because I FREAKIN love it, not because I want to be strong or look good (I am over that). Lord knows, if I didn’t love it then I am not squatting, benching, and deadlifting four days a week at five in the morning. I have also made the successful transition to an IIFYM lifestyle. I have not prepped a meal in over 300 days and counting!

This industry has changed me…for the better (finally). I used to be the laziest kid as evidence by my fat slothful (called husky to be polite) youth. Now, I won’t be outworked by a soul. I am dumb or crazy enough (depends how you look at it) to chase my crazy dreams and have experienced some success since learning about my full potential through powerlifting these include, but no limited to:

Summa Cum Laude B.S. Civil Engineering, Spring 2016 
3 Different Business Ventures Under Construction 
Pancakes &amp; Powerlifting 
Wolf of Scholarships (teach college students how to win scholarships…I won 50K) 
StructuralMD (small business with a professor and 2 friends) Learning to Trade Stocks Part-Time…why because I love to learn a new challenge

I am here to teach you these lessons and have a positive influence, I don’t want you to kill your opportunities like I almost did. My journey was long and I learned many tough lessons along the way. I want you to learn from me, because those who do not learn from history are bound to repeat it.

1913,1913,edsupport,"I'm certainly not the first person this has happened to. But I never thought it would happen again. I was bulimic 15-17 then stopped cold turkey and never looked back. My eating disorder continued to evolve and teetered between anorexia, restrictive eating, over exercising, and binging. But I never purged. I've had the overwhelming urge to during certain stressful uncontrollable moments in my life, and have maybe a handful of time over the 8-year dry spell when drunk (mostly justifying it because I couldn't inhibit the urge and to get the alcohol up). I can't say exactly what's started it up now almost a decade later, and so suddenly. I've been through periods of extreme stress before and my eating disorder always manifested into unintentional anorexia during the worst moments. This time, the bulimia happened almost voluntarily and naturally, like an old friend taking my hand again and leading the way. I started seeing someone new, and having a lot of intimate, body-exposing sex. I can recognize I felt vulnerable, and scared. I didn't want to be in such an open and close relationship with someone and it was happening out of my control. But it still surprises me that this is how I've chosen to handle it because I've been in, arguably, more stressful situations than this and it's been different. I think im unable to recognize my emotions and what they mean, where they come from. I never wanted this to happen again. Now I've been trapped for almost a month, purging at least once a day, if not more. I'm spending an incredible amount of money on food, eating until I'm in physical pain, and vomiting for hours. My mouth, throat, and fingers are raw. I dread him seeing my body. I've gained weight. I feel disgusted and out of control. I'm so scared because I can't stop it, the urge is so overwhelming it's almost unquestionable. I've been wasting so much time on this cyclical, destructive behaviour that it's put me behind school and added to my stress, which has only made it worse. I want this to stop so badly, I'm so lost. I don't know who to turn to and I can't afford to be going through this right now. This disease consumed 2 years of my life and put everything - my friends, family, school - all aside so It could fully preoccupy my time. Getting out of it was the best release that ever happened. I went right into an anorexic phase, followed by other things...but for the most part, I've been mostly recovered, accepting that the obsessing and anxiety over food, and occasional restriction and control, is just a natural curse that I have to live with.

1915,1915,EDAnonymous,"Apologies for the length, got a lot on my mind tonight. 

Here's a bit of context: I [20M] have a long-distance girlfriend [25F] who I've been dating for about a year now, and due to being LDR we're happy for eachother to see other people intimately (though not romantically, we're solidly committed that way). Just to avoid confusion.

I've gained XX amount of weight back since the middle of last year, so I'm struggling with not being thinner (though the difference isn't WILDLY drastic, I'm still within the same XXX amount). It's prompted me to relapse with self harm, and trying to figure out how to motivate myself to lose weight again since restriction attempts have continuously failed.

I don't truly look the way I want: my hair is significantly shorter because I had to shave it, I have lots of fresh scarring, most of my features have changed from weight gain and it makes me dress in looser clothes rather than the stuff I enjoy. In general, I hate how I look currently. My personality's fine, but nothing special.

What I DON'T get is how people can even show interest in me. My girlfriend continuously tries to remind me that she finds me inctedibly attractive, and while I can't really see it, I can sorta believe it by now. The difference is that lately, a couple of people I know have ALSO been flirting with me and making it clear they want to get with me. It's not unwelcome, but it feels so misdirected. I can hardly believe my girlfriend most of the time, how am I meant to believe these people too?

I don't get it. I just don't get it. I don't even want ANYONE looking at me until I've improved on the physical features that feel the most pressing. One of these people I flirted with previously and has seen my body when I weighed less, and it feels like once they know what I look like now, they'll be repulsed. Even if it's irrational, because I know that a sexual partner of my own weight wouldn't be a bother  - just that it's ME I really can't get it. 

It's nice, but it's also stressful. Every time I think of having to be undressed in front of anyone, including my girlfriend, I feel ill. I'm not even asexual, though my sex drive has been lower lately due to a mix of factors. I WANT to engage with my girlfriend and others, the interest is there, but the thoughts stress me out and I resort to just taking it out on the parts of my body that repulse me.

Sorry if this is a bit hard to follow. It's 4am and I'm not sure what I want out of this aside from getting it off my chest.

1928,1928,EDAnonymous,"For a small bit of background - I'm 33 and I'm trying to recover from a restrictive ED that I've had since I was a very young kid. I've been doing well lately but I'm having a bit of a mental health wobble and I'm finding it hard to deal with. 

Idk what my problem is exactly. It could be due to stopping a medication a while back that has famously savage withdrawal symptoms (venlafaxine). Didn't exactly talk to anyone about coming off it, just told myself ""it wasn't doing anything anyway"". I think it *may* having been doing slightly more than I gave it credit for. A small, very stupid part of me thought it might not be the worst thing if I got a bit depressed because I annoy myself by being too intense and enthusiastic about everything so I thought maybe I'd be less obnoxious if I was a bit flat.  

Right now, I'm not exactly sleeping much. My weird OCD bullshit is re-emerging out of nowhere. Feel like crying a lot of the time. Today I was stressed at work and caught myself just... casually fantasising about my own death/how to make it seem like an accident, as one does? 

Today is a really bad day and I honestly can't stomach the idea of eating or drinking. I've worked very hard to get to an ok-ish weight and I know from experience I have a habit of going downhill really fast when I get like this, rationally I really don't want that but today I really can't bring myself to give a shit, the idea of taking care of myself kinda makes me sick and its about as much as I can manage not to bash my stupid head against the wall rn.

I'm hoping I can just go to bed, get through the night, and maybe tomorrow will be better. If not... no idea what plan b is. I really don't want to talk to anyone about this but trying to seem fine when I'm having a bad day takes A LOT of energy and I'm pretty tired. I'm avoiding my partner because I don't want him to think I'm not fine, and I also don't really trust myself not to be weird. Like... when I'm doing good, I can generally keep a lid on the ""violent self-hatred"" stuff because I can recognise that to most people it seems extreme. When I'm feeling wobbly, it's harder to judge what's normal and my filter kinda sucks.

ranting i guess and honestly this might get taken down but it feels good to get some thoughts out. 

i hit my gw before vacation and was terrified i’d gain but accepted it if i did. i only gained less than a pound after vacation so i’m just still considering myself at the gw i had hit. i lowered it now because i feel like i only will like myself if i look sick. i also feel horrible for thinking that. 

when i was a few pounds more a few weeks ago, my mom and some others around me were concerned cause they thought i looked sickly. i had a cold that week so that’s why i looked so pale. i had asked her a few days ago why she didn’t believe me when i said i had a cold and that’s why i looked sickly and she said i just looked thin. i told her that i am technically thinner now than i was then and everyone’s all fine now with how i look. she didn’t really care. 

i feel like i don’t deserve anything in life if i don’t look sickly. i’ve never sought out for attention even though i’ve been through some rough stuff. i’ve always felt like no one has cared about me ever but i also never reach out so maybe it’s my own fault. even though i was threatened with the hospital when i had that cold and i guess looked too thin, it felt so good to know people cared about me and it’s so fcked up that i thought that way.

1938,1938,EDAnonymous,"I don't know where else to go to talk about this because there really isn't anyone else around me that understands what's going on.

So, my best friend and I have had our fair share of experience with ED and have struggled for years. Recently, I started to lose weight because I have been overweight now for about 2 years since the lockdowns started and such just letting myself eat whatever I wanted and not restricted by the vegan title I put on myself to reduce the amount of food I eat around others. And well, I was no longer guilty for my food intake and I felt like I finally had that freedom from the food guilt. I thought maybe I was ready to start purposefully losing weight and get fit, and so I did, but a little after, I went over to her house after not seeing her for a couple weeks and I noticed she was smaller and I mentioned it, and she straight up said yeah I weighed in at 125 (from 130 or so). I didn't ask for her weight. I noticed a scale right at the food of her bed perfectly placed in front of the mirror. I told her are you ok? I hope you're not purposefully restricting. And she said it was ""accidental"" and that she would forget to eat lunch or breakfast because she's so busy with her Master's degree and training and that she just never eats dinner either. Like she never eats dinner. I went out with her to buy some lingerie and we went into the same dressing room because the other one was taken up and at one point she just asked me ""do I look fat?"" when she supposedly doesn't like her weight loss. Then I saw her again after a while, and I mentioned to her, ""are you taking care of yourself? I just really don't wan't you to be restricting."" She says that it's an accident and that she isn't restricting on purpose. Without asking again, she tells me she weighs 117, but she said it with a smirk. 

I feel like if this is happening accidentally, she wouldn't be weighing herself everyday and saying her weight immediately when asked. She wouldn't say this happily. She tries to act upset about it to throw me off like she really doesn't like her weight loss. But I know what is happening, I can see the patterns. It also doesn't help seeing her post all over social media that she hates her body and mentions her ""past"" ED all the time. I know what's happening, and I try to ask but the thing with ED is that it has to be kept a secret because ""no one can know"" it's all just so secretive and I know that she will never tell me ""yes, I'm restricting to lose weight"" she won't ever because then I would try to encourage her to STOP doing that, and she doesn't want to stop because of this rapid weight loss. She lost 13 lbs in 6 weeks. This is another reason why I know that it's all on purpose.

It's hard to see this happening because I'm honestly being triggered by this. I'm on this route of purposeful weight loss as well, and I already thought this was a bad idea, but I'm also trying to gain muscle and I'm making sure I'm eating good keto meals.

1941,1941,EDAnonymous,"Tw: some vague numbers

I'm 27 and have struggling with body image my entire life, but have never been underweight despite losing 25% of my bodyweight at one point. I began restricting at age 12 and became bulimic ages 16-24. I managed to actually recover in 2020-2021 pretty much entirely on my own to the point I thought I'd beat this thing.

Then I lost almost my entire previous support system for one reason or another. I also moved and started teaching at a new school where I was constantly compared to the previous teacher (who was actually a horrible, horrible person) and was bullied/harrassed by a parent. Needless to say I relapsed and am now considered a chronic ED sufferer. 

Now I'm to the age where the fact I'm trapped is truly sinking in. My family is abusive/also dealing with their own issues and out of the picture. My best friend of 14 years can barely respond to a text (also has a lot going on). I haven't told my partner as I truly believe it wouldn't help anything. Treatment is prohibitively expensive and not really available in my area. In fact, only 10% of ED sufferers actually receive treatment in the US. 

I looked into low cost services but I'm either not thin enough or they refuse to treat me for being chronic. Also, I learned from experience that even though a therapist lists Eating Disorders I their bio does NOT mean they are actually trained in treating them, making the search even more complicated. As I've already proved to myself, I can't recover on my own. 

I have an appointment with a new therapist tomorrow and I'm not going to mention my ED. I have plenty to address anyway and I don't want to be dropped/ghosted again. I almost hate to admit how low my expectations actually are. Thank you for reading my rant. I'm not really looking for suggestions, but if you have a similar experience feel free to share.

1942,1942,EDAnonymous,"hey, i just wanted to say that this is in no way meant to be a harmful post, i just really want to reach out and ask you if anyone else feels that way:

i was overweight as a child, i ate my feelings because my parents weren‘t there for me for some time (i was 10 i think, my mum had a miscarriage). my mum was depressed, which is understandable, but i was not really feeling the same. i always loved my mum and needed time with her, but when she was not always there for me, i would just cry and / or eat.

i gained a lot if weight really quickly and my body couldn‘t take it, so i got a bunch of stretch marks, which im still rly insecure about.

when i was about to turn 13, i was really depressed (i have had these phases of rly bad depressed feelings since i was 10), so i decided to loose a lot of weight. i started to count my calories and wouldn’t eat more than like more than 400 a day. i lost over 50 lbs in 3-4 months and was pretty skinny. 
ppl were worried because i looked sick, i just lost too much way too fast. my hair fell out, i was pale and didn‘t have energy at all. 
it got so bad that on my 13th birthday i cried because of the cake, i thought it had way too many calories and i would gain the weight that i had lost at that point back.

so this was some time ago, im about to turn 15 now. my disordered eating got better after a few months, before i was 14, i was already kind of okay again. i didn‘t gain weight back after loosing it in such an unhealthy way, but this year i had to change schools because i am now in highschool. i hated the school a lot at first, and i got back into the habit of eating my feelings. i gained 18 lbs since school started this year and in november i decided to loose weight and be skinny again.

in december i started to starve myself again because i wanted to be skinny again as fast as possible. i don‘t have patience at all, so if i want to loose weight, it has to be as fast as possible. i lost 12 lbs again until now and i want to loose a bit more still. i am pretty good at not eating during the day, which of course helps me loose weight, but not in a healthy way at all. i have lots of willpower when it comes to starving, and i don‘t think i look way to fat anymore. 

but i have had this „problem“ lately:
i feel like fat ppl anger me.
i can‘t understand this feeling at all but i am feeling this way since december. 
they make me feel bad for them, knowing they can‘t really feel good about their body.
when i was fat i would cry a lot about it and my self esteem was non-existent. 
now when i see fat ppl, i get physically angry and i have to calm down. 
they make me feel fat too. i hated the mentality i had when i was fat and i feel like these fat people remind me of myself and how much i hated my body.
i have a rly overweight girl in my class and sometimes when i see her in the morning, i want to just simply punch her in the face because i get so frustrated and annoyed at all the fat on her body and face.
this is such a weird thing to feel and i can‘t control it. 

i am also a person who cries a lot to let out their anger. so sometimes at school i just have to go to the bathroom and lock myself in there because i feel like i might start crying infront of everyone and need to just calm down.
i hate looking at fat people, but i can‘t understand why. i was fat myself for a few years, so i feel like its something else than a person who has always been thin saying this.
i understand how you feel about being fat yourself, abd i was bodyshamed and knew what orher people were thinking about the way i looked.

but now, i have this hatred for rly fat people too. i hate myself for feeling this way, but i feel so helpless about it. i don‘t know if i hate looking at them because i know how much i hated being overweight, because i‘m afraid i will gain the weight back (literally my biggest fear), or beacuse i just turned into a bad person and i can‘t stop projecting my insecurities onto them.
i am not overweight right now, so why do i starve myself right now to loose weight, but they won‘t?? they are the ones who shouldn‘t eat, thats what i think, i get so angry about my brain hating my body so much that i just wont eat. but they always do and they have these flaps of fat on their ugly bodies and faces.

i know i shouldn‘t feel this way, but why do i then? 
btw my parents aren‘t thin either, but i don‘t feel this hatred for them, just for people i don‘t know personally, i really love my mum and dad:)
overweight teenagers are the fat people i hate the most, especially fat girls. 
i feel like i have to throw up sometimes when i see them.
i feel so bad saying this, because i was once fat myself, love some overweight people dearly, and am really afraid i might gain weight back again.
does anyone else have this feeling in them? it just gets worse when i am starving myself and see a fat person, i just have so much anger in me being constantly hungry, i am frustrated and i even scream at my friends sometimes over the smallest things they said.

They follow thousands of accounts filled with memes, video game stuff, and videos/photos of just pretty women in very sexual poses or outfits. 

I feel conflicted because on one hand I’m like, “Oh shit she’s so pretty. She looks good in that outfit. She looks so cute/adorable.” 

And on the other hand I’m like, “Am I a fool? Does my partner actually not like me? These women are definitely prettier than me…”

But recently they made a new account and I got curious. Same kind of accounts. 

I feel so conflicted. 

I feel like it’s unfair for me to be feeling this way. Part of me wonders if the only reason they get with me is just to have something to fuck and the rest of it is just a lie. 

Another random reason why I feel conflicted is because I’m an ambulatory wheelchair user and my partner also follows an account that shows an attractive woman in a wheelchair.

1955,1955,EDAnonymous,"I have been struggling with an ED off and on since like, 8th grade, with a bulk of it being disordered eating, spells of normalcy, and always been pretty consistent with binge/purge/restrict. The past couple years have been mainly restriction, landing myself in treatment last summer. 

I wasn’t underweight last time (got a little close) so most people were just like “WOW you’ve really lost a lot of weight! You look like a little Barbie!” Not knowing wtf I was actually going through to get there (I lost like 65 lbs, landing me at a 19ish bmi). Besides for my closest friends and family, they could tell I wasn’t okay, and I broke down and told them the truth about everything, even in years past because when I did binge/purge/restrict my weight wouldn’t change much or fluctuate the same like 15lbs. I moved forward with an off brand treatment, a half assed attempt, but I did start eating again and gained a healthy amount of weight back.

ANYWAYS, I’ve been in a relapse since the end of summer/fall, and have lost all of the weight I gained back in treatment plus some, I am at the lowest weight I’ve been at since I’ve been a teenager, and people are starting to comment. It gives me anxiety now seeing people again. With the holidays and cold and flu season I haven’t seen a lot of my friends/family since I was about 20lbs heavier.

1957,1957,EDAnonymous,"I haven’t drank in a while since my ED has gotten progressively wors because alcohol has ✨calories✨, but last night I went out dancing with my best friend and drank a lot on a fasting day… worst idea ever. when I got home I was wasted and surprisingly did not eat anything other than my safe food of rice cakes and yogurt, like 200 cals. 

But today I woke up feeling like absolute shit, so hungover, and ate about 300 cals of veggies before 2pm (so out of my comfort zone, my brain allows me to eat one meal between 6-9pm). Then, I debated ordering takeout (which I also never allow myself to do!!!), ended up ordering a small pho and two fresh rolls (+380 cals). That’s my usual calorie count for the day, so I should’ve stopped… but nope. 

Then I ate tortilla chips, crackers, rice cakes with vegan bologna, grapes, and just finished a bowl of corn with jalapeños. I think I’m past 1,300 calories in total right now (too scared to track it because im so ashamed). I’m literally a bottomless pit when I’m hungover, honestly ravenous. I feel like shit. I work out 5 days a week, each workout burns just under 500 cals, then I restrict to 700-800 a day. Today, no workout, and haven’t eaten this much ever while I’ve had my ED.

If I haven't used the right tags, let me know, idk how this works.

I have struggled with selfharm for a long time. The episodes are pretty short, (like a few weeks to months) but it seems to comeback. In different shapes. I have a strange relationship to my body like most people here, presumably. Something about destroying myself just gives me peace.   
I've found that recently I have been spiraling again, but this time my focus has been on eating. I am in this cycle right now, where I will cut calories because I really want to lose weight. I try to workout everyday. I just feel so disgusted with my fat body. But because I am depriving myself, some evenings it ends in binges where I eat carbs &amp; sugars. Immediate self-hatred kicks in. Then the next day I hate myself and I skip all meals till dinner, and I drink loads of water and coffee to distract myself from the urge to eat anything else. 

I don't have an ED. I think I have a disordered relationship with food for sure, but I have a disordered relationship with pretty much everything in my life.

I was also wondering, if people here recognize this behaviour. Indulging in disordered eating as pretty much a form of self harm, just something different from what you normally might have done.

I have been at a BMI of &gt;!15.4!&lt; for over 15 years. Sometimes a little lower or higher, but in that ballpark at least. I’m now 41 and have the following fairly severe health issues related to my low weight:
1) Macrocytic anemia: I guess this is normally associated with alcoholics, but my red cells are very large and can’t carry oxygen like normal. I’m constantly exhausted and it affects my mental capacity as well. 

2) Permanent gut issues: I either have diarrhea or constipation that lasts weeks with intermittent periods of normal pooping. It could be much worse considering how long I abused laxatives, but it’s still bad enough to affect my daily life.

I've been restricting the most I ever ever have and I've had an ED over twenty years. It's to the point where I'm scared that I might have really fucked up my body and I don't really know what to do. I don't talk to anyone about this except one of my friends who also has an ED. The past seven days I have had two slices of bread with vegan butter, a bowl of tomato soup and three Hersey kisses.

My heart feels like it's going to pound out of my chest when I stand up and when I sit down. I haven't really gotten dizzy all that much, typically when I'm restricting I get dizzy all the time.

1983,1983,EDAnonymous,"I don't really even know what I'm looking for here, but I'm sad and I'm struggling and I'm scared so I need to get this all out somewhere. I've had issues with eating (restricting) since I was probably 10, and have had periods of full blown anorexia between ages 10-22. My dad got me in therapy as a teenager but I didn't get much out of it because I wasn't actually wanting to get better. My weight has gone up and down for the past two decades but I've never been fully free from the obsession. I haven't been able to eat in front of anyone who's not my husband or my family without extreme anxiety for the past two decades.

I have a 1.5 year old son now, and while I was pregnant with him and breastfeeding I think I had the best relationship with food that I've ever had. I struggled a lot mentally with the weight gain but I was able to mostly eat normally and intuitively and I really felt like maybe I was magically better. Now I'm weaning my son which means I need to make a real effort to lose all the weight I've gained, and I'm just absolutely spiraling. I went from eating a pretty normal, overall mostly healthy diet to about 1000 calories/day and my brain is trying to convince me to eat even less. I can't stop thinking about calories and how quickly I can manage to get all this weight off. I don't want to talk to people in my real life about this because I'm scared of losing friends- I feel like nobody wants to be friends with someone who's struggling like this and having these issues. And I don't blame them, it's exhausting. I don't want to be that person who's always putting my shit on other people, they have their own issues to deal with and I'd rather be supportive than be asking for support. I just want to not be this way, I don't want to waste my son's toddlerhood worrying about weight and food and I don't want to keep skipping any social events that might involve food.

Regardless, I’ve struggled with bulimia since 2019, and I’ve had severe issues with my body image since I was in kindergarten. Until today, no one had ever said the words, “You are not skinny.” 

My body dysmorphia makes it hard for me to see what I really look like, and some days, I chose to believe that maybe I was slimmer, whether that was delusion or not. It was a way to cope.

Idk if this is allowed but this is where I feel the need to post this. I am currently in recovery from BED. I have lost a lot of weight through using the gym as a form of stress-relief, rather than using food (and then losing control of how much I would eat and eating until feelings of extreme sickness.) 

Only… I am a student, and I have work. And I have deadlines. I have too many deadlines to be able to go to the gym every day like I was doing. 

I miss it so, so, so much. It wasn’t about calories or control, it was about exercising and feeling good. It was about getting to the end of my day and feeling like I’d eaten tasty food in quantities that made me feel both satisfied and good. When I was bored, I would go to the gym and walk slowly on the treadmill and watch a movie and it would stop boredom-snacking, which triggered binges for me. 

Well I’ve eaten horribly this week. I’ve overeaten, mostly because I’m frustrated and stressed. I’ve felt stressed and now sick, out of control and unhappy. And I can’t just “remove” the stress - I can’t drop out of uni or get more help than I have. I’ve eaten massive, massive amounts. I feel terrible and sad.

2013,2013,EDAnonymous,"possible tw for relapse.

relapsed recently for the first time in years, I had a history of disordered eating habits even though I’ve always been a normal weight but during the pandemic I was really careful about restricting and could lose a few kg “healthily” — being thin is praised in my family so when I insisted I was on a healthy diet no one tried to stop me. I had to put in extra effort to make sure I didn’t slip into old habits but there was this secret satisfaction I felt whenever my family would praise how I looked. I could maintain without tracking calories or exercise for the next two years while at uni, I didn’t have a scale unless I went back home but it didn’t bother me even though I’d always weigh myself when I had the chance. I lived with my close friends so they’d express concern if they thought I wasn’t eating enough. now I’m on my own, living with new people in a new country, I made new friends but they aren’t watching me eat unless we go out for a meal (which is only maybe once a month). it was sooo easy to relapse and part of me is loving the freedom even though it’s way too dangerous.

2014,2014,EDAnonymous,"There has been tons of problems with my life since my ed, but something I will never forget is how differently people that you when your skinny.

When I was younger, I had BED, but no one cared about it, tried to help, wanted to know how I was doing, and overall people just didn't care about me, and no one cared about who I was.

Now that I am anorexic, and skinny, people not only care more, but treat me so much better.

 I get attention anywhere I go, people notice me, are genuinely interested in me. I click more and people even compliment me. Before I was no one, now I am someone. Why would I go back to being some enormous blob no one liked or cared about when I can be the ""beautifully tragic"" case that everyone seems to care about.

2035,2035,EDAnonymous,"I never got super bad w restriction but I did the whole recovery thing and honestly made a ton of progress. I ate a ton, powered through the discomfort, and had a good thing going at some point. Then I started naturally eating less which made me slip back into mild restriction and then binging 😬.

Like if I could just eat normally without overeating to the point of physical discomfort I wouldn’t restrict. But like I can manage that for a day or two and then my brain begs for the dopamine. It’s like if I’m going to binge anyway I may as well restrict. Binging feels better if I’ve been restricting anyway tbh. I know if I pushed through and just let myself eat for a couple weeks it would die down but that seems so mentally and physically draining. It’s stupid cause the amount I eat when I binge/try to give myself food freedom for a day is way more than how much I restrict so I’m probably gaining a bunch in this cycle but I can’t stop.

2037,2037,EDAnonymous,"I feel really discouraged right now. 

I started seeing a therapist and dietician a few months ago. I’ve been struggling a lot with behaviors lately, to the point that my therapist, dietitian, and I all agreed it may be time to seek a higher level of care. I decided PHP could be a good option and reached out to two centers. At my last appointment, my therapist said she would keep me on the schedule just in case. I thought I had effectively communicated to her that I wasn’t 100% sure if I wanted PHP, let alone could afford it or take time off work to do 6 day a week program. Regardless, I wasn’t planning on starting right away. To keep a long story short, I determined I cannot afford PHP and definitely can’t leave my job right now. So, I showed up to my therapy appointment on Thursday. I had been getting text and email reminders all week of my appointment. I waited, but my therapist never showed. I then emailed her and she told me she took me off the calendar because she thought I was going to treatment. She offered me an appointment today, but I declined (work). It’s hard to read tone through email, but she seemed annoyed at me and not that bothered that I waited only for her to never show. She then told me she can’t do any appointments next week because she’s going to a training thing. I apologized for not telling her about PHP and asked if we could do an appointment the following week. She never responded and it’s been 24 hours+.

2045,2045,EDAnonymous,"This isn’t really ED related, but this is the only subreddit I feel comfortable sharing this with. 

I guess I’ve been passively suicidal for a while now, I finally wrote it all down earlier today. It makes sense when I feel so hopeless about my future, yes I have things to look forward to and things I’m working towards achieving but I have this niggling feeling of it all being pointless. 

Firstly I know that in my state I won’t have much longer than 15-20 years in me (and that if I’m very lucky), the health problems I have now are only going to get worse, and my risk of severe complications is just increasing. So really what’s the point in doing anything if I’m going to be dead so soon. Secondly, I know that all the years in between now and my eventual death are going to be miserable at best and gruelling/painful at worst. My ED is my life, I have countless compulsions I have to complete everyday just to feel okay. It’s horrible, feels like torture, and my life so devoid of happiness. 

I am working tomorrow, I can’t drive because of my ED so have to rely on public transport. I just found out the train I normally catch has been cancelled and there are no trains running all day. So instead I have to drag myself out of bed at a stupid time in the morning so that I can walk to a bus stop and catch a stupid bus. It’s going to take me a whole hour to get to work instead of the normal 10 minutes. I’m so frustrated about the whole thing I’ve seriously considered killing myself so that I don’t have to deal with it tomorrow. 

I’m in such a bad place, I’m really depressed, and highly anxious all the time. I haven’t felt relaxed in weeks, I always feel on edge. 
I thought of being awake an hour earlier than I normally would be, and having to live in my brain for that extra amount of time is dreadful. I am struggling to cope with all of my thoughts being so overwhelming all the time. So often when things don’t go to plan I immediately jump to considering killing myself in order to avoid having to deal with the situation. 

I don’t really want to hurt myself, I just want things to be different and some escape from how things are and have been for years.

2046,2046,EDAnonymous,"Hi everyone
I’m new to this forum because I decided I needed to seek out help/find a community that understands my struggle. 
Backstory to this post: I’ve struggled with extreme caloric restrictions in 2019 that ended up with me in bad places but thankfully made my way towards recovery. However it flares up from time to time and I’m left with a lingering fear of my “no” foods but I had to work on active soothing so I didn’t feel guilty since it’s just something that I live with now and that’s okay And I’m proud of myself for being able to do so and handle it. 
However lately I have slipped into tendencies again and I find myself struggling in similar but different ways. I’ve been over gyming to the point where my body hurts so much but I literally can’t not do it because I get stressed and nauseous if I don’t go and don’t do my total workout. I also don’t eat properly before/after because the whole point is I’m trying to burn calories to offset what I do eat. Im stressed for my health because I’m in this mentality that yeah injuries happen to people, but given I have a history of being an athlete (I dance, climb, run, do yoga) and am more fit than most people in general (I’m 24 years old and I don’t mean this to sound pompous, I just know I do more active sports than anyone else in my friend group) they can’t happen to me. Especially because I was doing so much worse in 2019 compared to now so I extra have this idea that I can’t get hurt I’m build different and can endure more even though I’m so sore. 
The last straw that led me to finding this forum is what happened today - I go to the gym fasted and hadn’t eaten much the day before, did my workout, came home and took a nap since I have a big weekend coming up, and the entire time I felt like my head and heart were pounding, and kept having hypnic jerks, and swear to god I thought I was on the verge of dying but I also know I get paranoid about that stuff so dismissed it, again, because I did so much worse to my body in 2019 and survived.

Long story short, is there a possibility the Hypnic jerks were a result of nutritional neglect and overworking myself? Also like is my body okay or do I need to stop because I genuinely don’t know what my boundaries are or how to read if it’s normal to feel this sore or if it’s my body asking to stop.

2053,2053,EDAnonymous,"I’ve been in recovery for anorexia since fall 2020. I’ve been weight restored, eat normally, and even work in the restaurant industry, which has been surprisingly extremely healing and not triggering to me (I’ve been able to learn how to cook really good food without thinking about calories). However a beach vacation with my friends that I’m going on in a month has made me keep thinking about how I need to lose weight and get more toned to look good in a bikini/more revealing summer clothes. This is something I normally wouldn’t have to deal with this time of year because it’s winter where I actually live and even in the summer I don’t really like to go swimming or be in a bathing suit. But I want to have fun on my vacation and feel like I won’t if I don’t look good enough. Yet I also know that in the past I would restrict even more heavily leading up to a vacation and then spend the entire time miserable because I’m both in a calorie deficit and obsessing over what I’m eating there. I think this has been exacerbated by me watching a movie I wasn’t aware had an anorexic character beforehand and my mom also texted me this morning that she had pants that don’t fit her but might fit me if I want them because I look so skinny. And then she texted me acting worried because I’ve lost weight, which I wasn’t even aware of (don’t own a scale + body dysmorphia). Does anyone have any advice for getting over this?

2076,2076,EDAnonymous,"So it’s completely involuntary. I have a weird mix of what I am still trying to get diagnosed but have a dietitian. Anyway it’s looking like Arfid and binge eating.

Anyway I got my meals kinda up to three a day, I’m really trying but you kno shit happens I kinda call it a win if I have two meals each with all the food groups! Which belive me I cry over when I’m alone and is really hard.

Anyway because I am doing my best I moved onto the next stage which was adding stuff in, and mine was sushi. Due to a pretty shit few months sushi went from my favroute food to least favourite. Anyway I can’t eat it no matter what. I added two new things in (completely home made but still) and then tried sushi. And I have such a block. It’s gotten to the point where my brain has pushed back to the point of trying to go vegan on top of everything else and the binges are out of control. I can’t fuck this up I want to be normal again. But I just can’t eat the food and I keep crying and it’s just a mess, going vegan and I don’t want to change now it’s worse than it was before.

2084,2084,EDAnonymous,"So late into my teen years, I had a very strained relationship with my mum. We eventually reconnected and I talk to her about a lot of things now. I was talking to her today about how stressed out I am concerning the fact I didn't lose enough weight in time for my birthday today and she said something she said months ago ""It's not about your weight it's about your health"". I then explained that I'm trying to get back to my old set-point weight and she told me that its an admirable goal but as I get older and the longer I live in North America that weight will be a little higher than it was and I should really be aiming for about &gt;!10 lbs!&lt; above that. She also mentioned that I look fine when she saw me in October last year and I told her I had actually lost another &gt;!10 lbs!&lt; since she saw me (I actually lost a little more than that) she expressed that I was pushing too hard and I should just accept where I'm at and aim to lose another &gt;!10 lbs!&lt; to reach the weight she wants for me over about a year. 

It's cool and nice and positive to hear that now but where was that when I was 12 and she warned me that if I didn't watch my weight it would be impossible to lose later in life? Where was body posi mum when she was making me go on diets with her when I was 15? Where was body posi mum when she was comparing me to all my cousins and how beautiful they were?

2095,2095,EDAnonymous,"I'm back in therapy and I have expressed to my therapist uncertainty over whether or not I have an ED at this stage or if my mind is exaggerating everything. I've struggled throughout my life and I've been diagnosed previously with AN, AN purging subtype, and AN b/p subtype. Today she pulled out the DSM 5 and started reading the criteria for AN. I almost felt like she wanted me to diagnose myself or something even though I've answered questionnaires and she's repeated some of the same questions each week. 

Anyway, we didn't make it very far because she got into the weight criteria and I asked her to clarify ""significantly low"" body weight meant. So she started explaining the BMI criteria and how they indicated ""mild,"" etc. I explained that I found it triggering bc I knew that I'd fixate on feeling my weight not being ""low enough,"" that it isn't helpful to categorize severity in such a way. She answered with: ""Do you want me to read the entry for Bulimia?"" 

I'm still not sure how I should interpret all this but I do feel more focused on myself in a negative way. I know it's possible I'm misunderstanding. I might also be biased bc of my past experiences.

so i have an ex (her and i both women but idk if it matters for this post) and she used to talk a lot about her exes (as if that wasnt a big enough red flag) and literally ALL her exes had an ED, specifically restrictive ones. after some reflection on the relationship, which was very toxic for multiple reasons, im finding myself kinda weirded out or creeped out now by the fact that she was 'attracted' to the anorexic look. she said she wasn't and it was just a coincidence but still.... i dont think something like that is just a coincidence. tbf she has a lot of mental issues of her own which could explain why shes looking for equally 'damaged' people or whatever. it was just annoying as well as triggering to me when she would talk about exes and share experiences with them, like she was siltently comparing us to each other which made me just feel extremely uncomfortable.

just wondering what you guys think or have similar experiences with (ex) partners. i think itd be interesting to study this since there must be some kind of reason certain people are more attracted to the 'heroin chique' look while for many (heard this is my surroundings) the extremely skinny look is just scary. idk....",,(ex) partner attracted to people with ED,1,,discussion,,,,t5_rbmui,10lwmsw,1,TheRed-Queen,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10lwmsw/ex_partner_attracted_to_people_with_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10lwmsw/ex_partner_attracted_to_people_with_ed/,1674752431,255,0,1,0,0,1,Ex-partner only dated people with restrictive eating disorders,harmful,"Writer is feeling weirded out and creeped out by the fact that her ex was attracted to the anorexic look, Talking about exes and sharing experiences triggered the writer and made her feel uncomfortable",Ex-partner having a history of only dating people with restrictive eating disorders,harmful,"Feeling weirded out and creeped out by the ex-partner being attracted to the anorexic look, Feeling uncomfortable when the ex-partner shared experiences with past partners, Speculating that the ex-partner may be looking for equally ""damaged"" people due to their own mental issues",Ex-partner only dating people with restrictive eating disorders,harmful,"The writer is feeling creeped out and uncomfortable about their ex-partner's attraction to the ""anorexic look"", Talking about exes and sharing experiences was triggering for the writer"
2097,2097,EDAnonymous," 

So my church has a weekly potluck lunch and for awhile I’d just avoid eating much because it’s hard to feel safe, even when I track, if it’s other people’s food. But then brilliant me had an idea.

My ED is a small part influenced by guilt about money and spending it on food on me specifically. So I decided, heck, this is free food, I’ll OMAD it and that’ll be that. Then I upped my limit for that OMAD, from &gt;!up to 800!&lt; to &gt;!1200.!&lt; Basically allowing myself to “binge” once a week with some decreased guilt on all levels. 

But here’s where the fuckup begins. Last time, or some time recently, I ended up triggering an actual binge that lasted a few days because of this OMAD where I kept going back into the kitchen for more pieces of everything, no shame whatsoever. Ok maybe a little but my feral, food-obsessed brain was stronger, for once, than my social anxiety. 

Anyway, I’ve been back to mid/high res which is my usual goal, and then this week I’m not really even that hungry coming into the lunch. It’s smaller, too, not as many people, so not as many different options. And it’s spaghetti etc which is high cal in SUCH low amounts, which is, obviously, quite scary. 

I didn’t even need to try to skip breakfast (helped that I slept in) and I wasn’t thinking I even wanted much so I got a small plate. Not by ED standards but by general standards it was small. 

I can’t remember when the shift happened, but I unlocked this binge urge, though I resisted throughout the times I gave in too. Meaning, I had a second piece of garlic bread but not a fourth. (Wow, such willpower.) 

And then I end up grabbing a bowl of veggies (which I ate a decent amount of anyway because cherry tomatoes can GET IT and it was the best celery I’d ever tasted for some reason) and walking around with it in an attempt to satisfy the binge urges by volume eating. I’d already eaten what was basically maintenance so I was trying to ease out of a mindset where I’d keep eating. 

So I go and do some random games with some friends and I lose the urge to keep shoveling bread in my mouth like a starved Victorian orphan. 

But of course, it doesn’t end here, because I’m still at maintenance and the universe apparently wishes me ill. 

Someone decides it’ll be a great idea to get ice cream. And I make some excuses about allergies but it doesn’t work and I eat an ice cream cone. Not gonna lie, it was amazing. I haven’t had one in a while just because it’s winter as well as for obvious reasons. And I enjoyed it. I refused to let myself NOT enjoy it, because I was basically forced to eat it. (Not really but I can’t walk over and throw away an ice cream cone in front of the person who gave it to me. And no matter what YOU would do, I’M not going to shove it in my pocket :) 😉)

So it was a good cone. And it was a bad occurrence. Because it re-aroused the binge beast and I had to get another bowl of lettuce to avoid tipping the table into my mouth. 

Fortunately when I left the room again and then came back with a bit of binge intentions, the food had already been cleaned up. 

But now I get in the car with my family and my parents are starving because they didn’t eat much. So we go get some snacks at the store and I get given a portion, which, again, I have no convenient hidey-hole in which to shove. 

So I end up at &gt;!2,000!&lt; which I’m like, fuck. But ok, I did a lot of exercise playing games so I’m probably ok just for today. And I think I’m done and I should be satisfied, RIGHT??

But then I feel the need to eat, not 1, not 2, nor yet again 3. Not even 4, but FIVE protein bars which are NOT low calorie. I’m running around doing chores literally ravenous and stifling moans of hunger while I shove these protein bars in my mouth. 

Then I think I’m done. I did a few reps of weights so I can feel like I’m gaining something good from this insane saga. Hey, if I’m going to eat &gt;!3,500!&lt; might as well get them gains, right? :,)

Exercise can generally turn off some of my binge urges so I think I’m good.

Then, I have no recollection how, I decided to eat just o\^n\^e more thing. Maybe it was because I still have this weird belief I have to eat the protein after I workout or else it won’t work. That’s not true, right? 🤨

To make a very long story shorter, I ended up spooning sunflower butter, after carefully measuring and then just saying, screw it im eating from the jar, as the fam walks into the room. So we leave to go somewhere else and for 15 minutes after we leave I’m thinking about this food and I’m wishing I had brought it. Then I lose the urge to eat and I’m grateful I didn’t bring it. 

Then we come home and I’m stupid so I eat a little bit of what I don’t necessarily feel a huge urge to eat but I do feel somewhat hungry and everyone else is having snacks so I have one too. 

I have to mention, at this point my stomach is quite full, kind of hard from all the food packed in it, but I’m still HUNGRY. I’m freaking ravenous. That was how I felt the entire day when I felt this insane urge to eat and eat and eat. 

Anyway, I eat snacks with my siblings, and I end the day at a glorious &gt;!4,300!&lt; cals. Dude. 

The thing is, I know that todays weight isn’t real, just food weight, but I also know that this brought my week’s average almost up to a point where it doesn’t even out to me restricting at all. 

But I still can’t feel that much guilt or panic, which in a sense is good, but so, so odd. 

Not sure if I’ve started a binge/restrict cycle, so pretty scared of that, but I haven’t yet decided what to do about today. Should I ease down by eating maintenance and lowering, or should I go back to normal mid-high res? I guess I’ll see what happens. I’m still full from yesterday and I have to focus on ✨life✨ what a glorious concept. Other things are boring but my ed always have something interesting to throw at me 🤪😭

If I don't eat frequently with POTS my symptoms get worse, so I'm just trying to not fall back into restriction.

My brain is just romanticizing the days where I was deep into restriction, even though it might be likely that my ED is what triggered this condition in the first place. I was miserable. But I just look past that part and only focus on my weight. I think the only reason I was doing so well with my body and food was because it wasn't changing. I was at a size I was comfortable with.

2107,2107,EDAnonymous,"There was a point in my life about 5 years ago that I could not even SMELL binge triggering foods without being triggered. I would literally hold my breath if I had to. My binge eating is much more managed these days. Being around my boyfriend has made me realize that “normal” people will grab a snack like a bag of chips and eat like 1 chip a minute. I will eat like 6 a minute. He will eat each chip in several smaller bites, and I will shove two or three in my mouth at once and finish chewing and swallowing them before he has finished one. I really never realized how quickly I ate and how much I ate until I started dating him. I wish I could snack like him. He can feel perfectly satisfied eating 10 chips but I won’t feel satisfied until I eat at least 30. So I try to eat none because as soon as I start snacking, I can literally feel a physical, mental, and emotional transformation take place. It almost feels like a burning sensation in my entire body. And binging my ass off is the only thing that quiets this feeling so i just avoid the start if a binge as much as possible. Coworkers bringing in snacks is the worst. I can’t fucking stand it. Pleaseeee stop offering me snacks because I feel physically uncomfortable trying to refuse them. I try to avoid looking at them and smelling them because the second I do, I become instantly ravenous. One tiny little taste and it’s fucking over. All willpower is lost. It’s such a humiliating feeling even though no one knows. I have such an all or nothing mentality with food.

also i apologize if this doesnt read well or if my spoilers dont work, this is my first reddit post.

but i have never been anywhere close to underweight until last month when i got out of that cycle of losing the same weight over and over. and i guess i never processed it? so now im feeling of course a little happy, but much more depressed and anxious. i expected finally reaching under &gt;!100 lbs!&lt; to feel amazing, like i finally achieved what ive been wanting for years. but instead i feel scared and depressed bc i feel like now my eating disorder is real, which is funny bc thats all ive wanted for two goddamn years. to feel like my eating disorder was real and not something i was making up.

but all i can think about is how ive crossed a line and i am just going to get sicker. im feeling guilty too because i think a ""real disordered person"" would be overjoyed. but i just feel depressed and scared and guilty. im worried about my family and the people closest to me, and how this snowballing (which is inevitable im not really interested in recovery right now as i already failed at it) is going to affect them.

My hands and feet are constantly cold, this could be due to just a natural difficulty with thermoregulation due to autism.

Today I bought a mango loco monster during a binge (second day bingeing and buying energy drinks in a row whoops). I haven’t had that flavor since November 2020 so I got really nostalgic and honestly emotional. I then spent like half an hour smelling the empty can and crying because I missed it so much.

At the beginning of my ED I only had like 3 fear foods and full sugar monster wasn’t one of them (sugary fizzy drinks were though. Logic?). I could drink sugary monster as long as it was a ‘meal’ by itself. I miss that so much. I realized that most of the ED rules that have developed since then truly are about denying myself stuff I like.

She is literally asking just to ask, but why the fuck do you care? It's like being on your phone, minding your business and someone asking what you're doing. Don't worry about it! 

Is it people trying to make small talk? Both of my parents did this as well, but especially my dad, and he would always have something to say. I tend to microwave food because I need to eat as soon as I feel like I can, &gt;! otherwise I will just starve myself, &lt;! and he would come in and say it was gross that I'm microwaving pizza rolls.

2136,2136,EDAnonymous,"A little over a year ago I (24F) was visiting family for Christmas. I was put in PHP when I was 19, which traumatized me (but that’s a whole different story I can post about another time—basically after I left 2 therapists quit partially because of how i was treated) and has always been a weird topic for my family. 

I’m the oldest, but I have a younger sister (19) who, lo and behold, developed a severe eating disorder around the same age I did. She lost more weight faster than I ever had, and I have always, always blamed myself for her eating disorder. We’ve discussed it (we have a great relationship) and she has acknowledged that watching me harm myself did impact her negatively as a kid. I’ve come to terms with it. 

Last year over Christmas she was in the peak of it. She was very thin, but her proportions were very modelesque (straight and narrow, clothes looked amazing on her). My family, even after I spoke to them about how she was going through it, constantly complimented her the entire time we were there. They bought her clothes for Christmas, and said everything looked great on her. She was miserable. 

I was, understandably, stressed out by this situation, but we’re best friends so I forced myself to eat to encourage her to eat. Later that night, I was walking downstairs and I overheard my brother and grandma talking. 
Sophie and is my sister’s name, my name is Bella. 

Brother: Sophie is only x percent underweight. I think she looks good. If she’s eating healthy it’s fine.

Grandma: I was 99lbs when I got married. I think she looks great. Everyone is freaking out over nothing. You know, Bella never got as skinny as Sophie, but she looked horrible. 

Brother: Yeah she looked really bad. So pale. They just need to get over themselves. It’s not that big of a deal. 

My sister’s hair was falling out. So I come downstairs to get water, furious, and they basically force me to say what’s wrong and then tell me I’m overreacting and that nothing is that serious, my sister was fine. I cry, feel stupid because I’m 24 and crying, and a day has not gone by since where I don’t think about that conversation.  

Also, two months later, my sister lost her period, had an enormous breakdown, and had to go into intensive therapy.

2145,2145,EDAnonymous,"i am lying to everyone in my life that i am doing better. my whole ordeal started in december of 2021. i started taking my restriction seriously in february of 2022. the weight dropped off with ease, rapidly. my starting weight was a little over &gt;!210 pounds!&lt; (estimate, since i stopped weighing myself over the shame of seeing that number) and i was averaging &gt;!15 to 20 pounds a month!&lt; . that was until my primary care doctor pointed out the rapid decline in my weight, and referred me to an outpatient ed program. since july, i have been being going there to be monitored routinely. at first it was bi-weekly, then weekly (because i did not stop losing, though at a much slower pace) and now, i have successfully fooled them into allowing me to visit every 3 weeks. but the truth is that i am still losing, i fake my weight and i slap a smile on my face. i’ve pretended to be willing to take the medication they prescribe me (because on top of this, i’m also dealing with major depressive disorder) and that it’s making me feel better. i’ve realized this is the only way to evade residential. my doctor had been recommending it for months prior, and i was sick of hearing about it. i can’t lose control. i can’t ever go back to how things were. it’s not a shocker that at the weight i was, i suffered from BED. i am just trying to fly below the radar until i’m 18. then i can stop going to see them. it will be my choice. i’m &gt;!111 pounds!&lt; now. on their chart i’m nearly &gt;!119!&lt; . i don’t know how much longer i can keep this jig up, until the doctor realizes it. i might have to stop losing for a while again, and work on maintaining. it just fucking kills me to not be constantly losing weight. it’s my one comfort. everything can suck, but as long as i’m losing, i feel pretty. i feel proud, and successful. it’s the one thing i’m good at. i’m just not satisfied, and i don’t think i ever will be. i’m terrified of gaining weight. i’m 5’1, any weight gain is extremely noticeable on me. i look fit. i have an exercise addiction, and i obsessively weigh everything i eat. i am terrified of food i did not prepare myself, or that is “bad”. i hate feeling so isolated, so alone, but i can’t stop. not yet. even if i did want to recover, the family i was born into makes it impossible. they are all obsessed with their bodies and weight. we have cabinets full of protein powder and pre workout, our fridge and pantry carries little if any junk food. that works out great for me, but with something as fragile as the process of recovery, this environment makes it seem laughable. they all applauded me for my strong will and commitment up until about 20 pounds ago. now they say i have a problem, yet still talk about their weight loss and how much they dislike their bodies. it hurts me to see that now it’s taking a toll on my brother. he’s started to care about macros, calories, and exercise. he is still somewhat normal about his food but i feel like it’s my fault, like i didn’t hide my habits well enough. he’s heard me &gt;!purge in the bathroom!&lt;

My gf at the time expressed concerns over my obsessive dieting and exercise. Being able to guesstimate calories just by looking at a dish fairly accurately. Now that I’m in the military I’m praised for looking like I’m in good shape, I’m not big by any means, just very lean and fast. I’ve been eating eggs, chicken, vegetables, and mashed potatoes religiously every day. If I eat something other than the foods I listed I get pretty bad stomach aches, I usually just end up throwing it up, usually by choice, other times it just comes back up. Like I can eat other foods within reason, like small amounts of fruit, small amounts of candy, small amounts of soda, raw fish/sushi, however, too much of even those things I get physically I’ll. But other things like pastas, sandwiches, burgers will 100% make me feel ill. I usually just fast for 24 hours 5 days a week, eat about 3-5 plates of chicken and vegetables and on the weekends I’ll eat some breakfast foods like eggs and hash browns and maybe some bacon. If I stray from this diet it causes this weird itch in my brain and I feel the need to punish myself by fasting, generous amount of exercise, or purging if it doesn’t come back up on its own. I use black coffee to help me feel full and keep my body in a ketogenic state while fasting. I don’t look like I’m starving, I have a pretty good physique but I have terrible body dysmorphia. Can’t stand the thought of gaining some body fat and if I do in the slightest amount it’s extremely noticeable to me and it affects my self image a lot. Everyone tells me I look good, and I know it’s in my head that I don’t look good but I can’t help but stare in the mirror for hours trying to see what everyone else does. Sometimes I avoid my reflection completely because I’m ashamed of myself because I might’ve strayed from my diet that week once or twice. But honestly haven’t been diagnosed with an eating disorder, I don’t want to seek help because I don’t what it interfering with my military career because mental health is so scrutinized here. Not sure if it is an eating disorder or if it’s just body dysmorphia.

21 days of vacation. Practically binged every single day. I don’t know how much is “real” weight but I’ve put on close to &gt;!15 lbs !&lt;  either way, my abs, that I worked so fucking hard on and the only thing that made me feel attractive, are gone. 

I can’t look at myself in the mirror. I hate how my clothes fit. This isn’t bloat this isn’t water weight there is new fucking fat on my body. 

I feel disgusting. I don’t want anyone looking at me. I put on weight so fast and everything I ate was because “I won’t get to eat this at home.” Food has every hold over me. 

And now I’m back at 20-25 hrs a week at a fucking retail job and full time school. I hate that shit and all I want to do is eat to feel better. And I can’t.

2157,2157,EDAnonymous,"Kind of a rant so TW

Hey y'all! Basically the title lol, but let me give you sum context... So back around September last year my ED kind of disappeared??? I mean, literally one day I woke up an the ED thoughts and desire to restrict, the weight gain fear, the intensive obsessive HIIT exercises, etc... Kind of went away, just like that? Which weird but okayyyy~ and mind you my bmi was quite low (I'm not bragging it'll make sense later)

Up until this now, i was doing fairly well... Not restrict, 3 meals a day and a shit ton of snacks without feeling guilty... I also stopped exercising completely, so i was very sedentary lol. I was just back to normal? Somehow if that makes sense? However tho I did gain some weight during this months... A quite considerable amount lol, mostly body fat n i lost my jawline n abs lol (funny enough my family always kept calling me too thin n skinny, which i know is not true, but yeah my disordered brain is... Lovely~) 

So now, fast forward to today, your girl got triggered but the most stupid ass shit ever. I have this friend (who's one of my only two friends), let's call her Marry for the sake of the story. So Marry, has always been chubby n she never really liked exercising n always ate junk food n that made my brain kind of... Calm and happy? I know I am the problem and something is really wrong with me... Point is!!! That earlier this month Marry told me she was at the gym, i didn't think much about it brushed it off, ignored it and carried on our convo. But today.... Oh boy today.... She told she was at the gym and she was training n also that she has been eating close to nothing and very much bragged about the change she has noticed. I never really imagined she was working out and that hit me like a train... 

I know i must be happy for her but... She knows about my struggles and she also knows that I am uncomfortable about speaking about working and eating in general yk? So it's kind of shitty... Plus she also told me that she ""now looked like me when I was UW"" (ik it's not true ate all, i have seen her recent pics n no.) THAT... i didn't not like that... It made me feel so invalidated, because she literally looks the exact same... Now I'm wondering if I looked like that, I'm overthinking n hurting with my own thoughts lol... When she told me that i got pissed mad idk i threw everything on sight lol. 

Please, i know i am not the most rational person but now I want to go back to st@rving and exercising until i couldn't take it anymore... It was HELL, I really don't want to go back, i swear I was better but this was my last straw i can't. Anyone has tips on harm reduction or anything really would help me... My other friend is on the ICU so i haven't talked to him in more than a week now, i feel so alone

I'm sharing this because it needs to be a wakeup call. It was for me.

I'm a BMI &gt;!17.9!&lt;. A lot of people with eating disorders wouldn't think that's in the danger zone. Most days I eat about &gt;!1000!&lt; calories on average so not even severe restriction. But neing underweight *IS DANGEROUS. AT ANY LEVEL.* I found this out today the hard way.

I had a monster ultra this morning, as usual, no breakfast, barely any lunch, then went to the gym as usual... and I reached a bpm of 209 without even trying.

It makes me feel like it’s because I’m too curvy or not dainty enough so I struggle to want to eat and don’t like eating as much anymore.

And then with my new job any time I make a mistake or am told off I feel like I don’t deserve to eat, I feel so bad and don’t want to eat.

When I’m outside and people stare at me or smile at me I get anxious and panicky because I feel so hideous and don’t want anyone to look at me.

Today I cooked for my gfs family. This is not unusual, I love cooking and I'm a pretty decent cook (maybe because I have a food obsession hahah). So when they all came home I had just finished making lunch so I asked my gf how many dishes I had to serve. She answered ""Six. Well... Are you going to eat?"" and I asked her if she was counting on me in those six people or not, and I told her that I didn't really feel like eating. She knows I worry about her and what she eats because I don't want her to end up like me, and she has had body image issues in the past. So she said ""Then just serve 4"" and I was like is she not going to eat either? And I asked her why, she asked the same thing to me and I was getting really stressed, she went on ""You HAVE TO eat something! You didn't eat anything yesterday!"", so I got really mad about all the pressure she was putting on me by basically saying I'm forced to eat today. I didn't want to make a scene in front of her family and I don't want them to know I have issues with food, so I just told her that ""Okay, I will fucking eat, ffs"". I served myself a huge fucking dish and sat on the table. I ended up binging once everyone left the table because I was so annoyed, I got even more annoyed when she came to the kitchen and kept staring at me the whole time I was eating, it makes me feel so guilty and disgusting. So I just left whatever I was binging on there in the table and ran to our room. She came after me and asked me why would I get mad at her for just asking me to eat. Also at this point I must have developed gerd or something and ended up throwing up from eating so much, and she knows this always happens.

Storytime ig: I went to the washroom with a girl I had just met and I told her I really wanted to wash my hands after seating on grass. And for some godforsaken reason she decided to tell me that she washes her hands because a few years ago she cared too much about her body and her image. So she starved herself, landed in the hospital, was so thin that doctors and family were super worried and now is trying to care less about her image. Ended it with ""but food is still scary when i dont wash my hands.""

TW: mention of numbers (weight, calories), suicide mention, hospital talk

It feels like society thinks that an anorexic goes into hospital for a few months, fattens up, and then comes out a completely changed person, never wanting to return to their old habits again. According to movies, at least. But what actually happens when an anorexic is weight restored? What happens when that person originally diagnosed with the disease ends up gaining recovery weight, and then again, relapses in the same fashion they did to lose that weight in the first place? No one takes them seriously. Because once you're off your death bed or physically don't look like you're on deaths doorstep, at least), medical professionals will turn a blind eye and blatantly tell you to stop being so dramatic.

im broken. i have no idea how to cope. he broke up w me in mid december, told me we might get back together if the circumstances were right. apparently he was tryna link with the girl he almost cheated on me with a couple days before he died. i kept giving him chances. i kept him in my future. he was my only social contact. he was so toxic but i fucking loved it, our relationship was like predator chasing prey, his body was amazing, his personality and humor unparalleled, his interests kept us connected. as selfish as it may sound im worried about the fact that his character is fucking irreplaceable. i deserved better but i never wanted better, i wanted Him. 

when i go about my day i have thoughts like ""he should be in my place right now"", whenever i feel slightly positive i kick myself. he saved me from overdosing in november in the same exact spot he died, it should have been me, with no will to live, with no energy to be productive, who should have died. he loved to be alive, he was a music producer and an artist, fucking 18 years old and offered more to the world in his short life than i ever have in my twenty. part of me feels as though his family members wish it were me instead of him as well. imessage made it fucking pain staking to keep an eye on him, he ghosted me for 24+ hrs more than once and all those instances i had thought he died. deep down i know i could have done more. days before his death he was telling me how happy he was maintaining his longest sobriety streak. now hes fucking dead. fairytails about time travel and resurrection seem like a curse now, i would do fucking anything to take his place and save his life.

im trying out a grief specialist on wednesday and am trying to get a job to keep myself occupied. but the future seems bleak and i dont think ill ever rid myself of guilt. he feels like my ""one that got away"" except he hasnt moved on he fucking died. of the same substance i eagerly go out of my way to pursue. after telling myself i would never touch the substance that took him away from me again, im seeking out heroin.

bla bla anyway im getting fatter and that doesnt help my case, grief skinny sounds more pleasing than whatever the fuck i got myself into this week. today i felt guilty indulging, thinking about how much he loved to cook for me and loved to see me eat. hopefully that fuels starvation cause i cant take damaging myself both emotionally And physically.",,fucking grief binging,1,,substance abuse,,,,t5_rbmui,10jwvyk,1,ihatedrugsandsex,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10jwvyk/fucking_grief_binging/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10jwvyk/fucking_grief_binging/,1674533815,536,0,0,0,-1,1,Ex-partner passing away from a heroin overdose,harmful,"Increased binge eating and purging after attending virtual funeral, Feelings of guilt and self-blame for not doing more to prevent the overdose, Desire to seek out heroin despite knowing the consequences, Negative body image and desire to lose weight due to grief","Ex-partner died from a heroin overdose, blaming herself for his death, negative body image and eating disorder",harmful,"Blaming herself for his death and experiencing guilt, Negative body image and engaging in disordered eating behaviors, Desire to use heroin again despite knowing the risks, Seeking help from a grief specialist and trying to find a job to stay occupied","Loss of ex-boyfriend to heroin overdose, guilt, and grief",harmful,"Engaging in bingeing and purging behaviors, Feeling broken and having difficulty coping, Struggling with guilt, self-blame, and suicidal thoughts, Desire to use heroin again"

My girlfriend and I just had our first anniversary and she was showing me some texts she sent her friend from the night we met.

Everything was laughs and giggles until we get to her sending pictures of me and saying I’m not her usual type because she usually only likes tiny -emanciated- girls.
And her friend says I have a banging body and that I’m slim thick. They laugh.

Not laughs anymore, suddenly I want to rip my skin off. She tells me I look like I’m about to cry, she says that that was before that she loves my body so much and tells me so all the time. I’m her first love and she only ever had crushes in celebs before that that’s not realistic , I start seeing blurry. She cries and tries to explain but I leave her house before I throw up. 

I feel so humiliated, I’ve always been curvy and oversexualised , I also have ptsd from SA this is of course not her fault at all. And at the time she did not know but I would never talk about an other woman like that stranger or no. 
 But I feel so betrayed that before she fell inlove with me she spoke like that about my body, I feel fat but also used and so ashamed. 

Am I overreacting? I just don’t feel like I can go forward without constantly feeling like she’d like me better if I was smaller it’s so triggering and the fact that her friends ( who are now my friends) know this is so humiliating to me.

How do I talk to her about this? How can I trust that she would not like me more if I was smaller? She’s bigger than me in every sense, my body is just very very shapely ( big butt) but it’s never been an issue and she does seem to love it but now I can’t stop tripping .",,Help the love of my life hurt my pride.

I was in the right frame of mind before I went and had Shiritaki noodles before so I wouldnt be hungry. And it was all going fine, till I went to get my safe foods (a staple of my diet, the small handful of foods I will eat every day and not have to purge) and EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM was sold out. Triggering a huge binge buy instead. And I have come home and eaten it all and puked it all up. 
When I was in the shop there was an anorexic girl walking around with one thing in her basket looking really unhappy and anxious and I so wished I was still like her, but also wished I could have got talking to her or atleast shown her some understanding but I couldn’t I just felt really ashamed of myself because I’m not like her anymore. 
Leaving into my next point of ranting, I was really fucking good at being anorexic, I was at a LW and was consistent with it. It felt amazing, I NEVER binged. I didn’t count cals, I just ate a very small amount because I didn’t care for food. Then I was made to ‘recover’ where I basically just weight restored but never mentally recovered and about 5 months ago I relapsed super hard but failed at becoming anorexic in the way I used to be. Now I’m just fucking bulimic, feel like I’m dying inside but NOBODY SEES IT because on the outside I look like a healthy/slim/ BUT HEALTHY weight.

this morning i saw her, we chatted on the treadmills then when she was finished she left to go do some yoga. i went to go take a shower and change and get ready for school. my mom was finished with her workout and ran into me again in the locker room, this time in my normal clothes instead of my gym clothes.

she immediately gasped and started freaking out about how skinny i look/am and telling me to please force myself to eat more and blah blah blah. then she told me i look really good and really healthy when i’m wearing my gym clothes. it’s just in my normal clothes i look so sickly skinny.

so now, i’m sitting here wondering how tf i can be wearing skin tight clothes and look healthy if i’m sickly skinny in baggy jeans and a long sleeve crop top. for some reason the only thing my brain is holding onto is that i look really healthy and now all i can think about is how much more weight i’d have to lose before i finally look skinny in my gym clothes.

This community has offered empathy to me. 

I feel much less alone.

I wake up, I read about people with similar thought processes and/or coping mechanisms.

Yesterday I realized since when I have been here (in this sub, not since I have had disordered eating habits). 

I started searching for empathy. 

Empathy that didn't feel that too far from my self-destruction; something that I felt I *deserved*, truly. 

My partner cheated on me in May. 

This deeply traumatized me as I was in a fragile mental state. I wasn't in the country.

Aside from incidentally seeing the person he cheated on me with, who was thinner than me, I also just really felt the inmense and heavy *WEIGHT* of this horrible thing. 

I wanted it all gone. The image, the emotional baggage, the speculation, the way I felt that I deserved more but couldn't prove it to myself. 

It felt so unshakably heavy.

I couldn't eat that week. 

Can't eat that well now.

I've lost a few pounds so far and it's so satisfying seeing the number go down. I keep telling myself I'll be happy with my losing 25lbs but honestly I know that's such bullshit.

2248,2248,EDAnonymous,"Growing up, I was the eldest of three, a “gifted” kid who excelled at anything she set her mind to, and overall a happy person. I was headstrong, and above all, I thought very highly of myself. I remember comments about my body. I was the chubbiest of my siblings, with a naturally model-esque younger sister. But that didn’t deter me from loving myself.

I developed early, with massive honkers by early high school, relatively taller than my classmates and always a bit tubby. I didn’t start looking at myself critically until my first boyfriend made comments about my body. Over the course of my final years in high school, I started noticing weight gain. I loved food. I turned to it as an emotional escape. Getting to college I put on even more. 

By the end of my freshman year I was overweight. I resolved to lose weight, and did it in a healthy manner. I still grasped on to the vestiges of my youthful confidence when I was alone, but with others I constantly compared myself and more often than not came out less than.

The weight-loss stalled when I was in the average BMI range. I wasn’t as thin as I wanted, but I was happy. When my relationship at the time ended, I gained more confidence than ever. Covid struck, a blessing in disguise as I had fewer people to compare myself to.

That was until a game night with friends, one of my closest friends admitted that she found our other friend prettier than she found me. Suddenly, my carefully curated confidence crumbled. I had formed walls of glass around my body image, supported by the buttresses of isolation, and in one felled swoop the girl I trusted most stomped the whole thing to shit.

Here’s where my wannarexia phase started. I launched into a cycle of restrict, binge, and then I learned how to purge. I never lost weight. I simply maintained, and by maintained I mean whipped between weights above and below my original weight. I romanticized the ED then. The beautifully twisted, angsty lines that circulate tumblr, twitter, that seemed to echo the ideal I wanted for myself. I felt pride in my isolated hell, thinking myself better for it. No one knows what I’m going through and that makes me different, stronger, and better than them.

I had no clue what it meant for things to get real.

Food was always a comfort for me, so when my life actually started to get hard, and when I lost control of stress, control over food was the only thing I had left.

Now I sit, underweight, with worried parents, no energy to do what I love. When I’m bored, instead of creating beautiful things or forming beautiful connections with people, I spend hours recklessly binging and then meticulously purging. My free-time is consumed by food and all I can do now is mindlessly follow along.

I feel sick and disgusting, and I know i won’t be able to stop anytime soon. I want this all to be over, but I have no hope for resolution. 

I wish I could go back to the naïveté, the blind confidence. I feel like a shell of who I was. I don’t feel cool or unique. I spend more time gazing into a toilet bowl than I do anything remotely fun.

I hate that I didn’t get the help I needed when I hated myself, and now I’m stuck paying with my life.

So please, no body is worth the sacrifice, or the “cool” quotes, it’s all so meaningless when you can’t look at yourself in the mirror for the shame of another day of failures.

2254,2254,EDAnonymous,"i am totally lost &amp; out of control in this. i don't think i've ever \*not\* had a disordered brain (thanks entirely to my mom) but it's never felt this way before and it's scaring me. and i am SO MAD AT MY MOTHER about it.

  
i started extreme restriction for the first time at age 11, but i was already well aware in kindergarten of the importance of my size and what was ""acceptable"" (as well as how i was failing). my sense of overwhelming failure led to binge cycles, and for over two decades i've swung through every disorder in months or years. i blamed myself (and i know i am responsible now as an adult) but i'm beginning to realize how much my mother indoctrinated me, and now that i'm aware, i am furious with her.  


it is embarrassing to know i have wasted energy every day of my life on this. over the years there've been times when i manage to eat in a way that appears more ""normal"" for a handful of weeks, but it takes SO MUCH F&amp;\*%ING ENERGY to do that, i inevitably get exhausted &amp; go back to either restricting or bingeing/purging again.

&amp;#x200B;

my mother is very disordered and equally stubborn &amp; in denial-- a clinically depressed narcissistic anorexic who honestly wasn't mature enough to have had children. starting around age 14 she went on classic ed ""diets"" with me (everything from cabbage soup diet, to lemonade cleanse, to even stupider ones like 3 oz of butter a day &amp; nothing else... it's amazing i managed to keep my grades up with the bs diets we went on together.) she also tried to hide my (estranged though not by my choice) sister's death, and didn't do anything about my getting abused by a teacher at school for four years even though she slipped a few years ago and said something that indicated she knew. but as long as i stayed her quiet, obedient, pretty little doll and everything looked fine from the outside, that's all that mattered to her.

2258,2258,EDAnonymous,"TW curse words and generally uncensored talk. 
.
.
.
I’ve made it a point to be very careful about my “habits” and I’ve always tried to be the body positive, you deserve a treat, eat when your body tells you to, type of person toward other people. About a month ago, I had a breakdown after triggering myself. I broke down to a roommate who has ventured into this territory with me before in front of another roommate who absolutely has not. He’s a safe person to talk to about things like this but I *knew* she had been struggling with recent weight gain. I wasn’t thinking clearly and it didn’t cross my mind until after. I said some really nasty things about myself, my weight, and the way I eat. 

Since then, she’s been struggling with her weight a lot more. I can see the sadness and dread anytime food is brought up, she’s limiting herself in a way that can lead to restriction quickly, she’s started using very negative language to describe her body, etc. I’m not saying she’s joining the community anytime soon, but the fact that I made someone feel badly about themselves and I can see them going through the same things I went through when all this started makes me feel like shit. 

I can tell myself that I’ve been careful, that my body positive quotes and food positive “mindset” have ensured I haven’t triggered anyone. But let’s be real. She’s not the first person I’ve triggered, she’s just the first person I’ve been around after triggering them. I can’t live like this and honestly believe nobody else has been effected. Maybe I’m not going around calling people fat or spreading Pro bullshit, but the things that triggered me all those years ago were subtle too. It’s a comment here, a remark there and before you know it, you’ve spent over 15 years hating yourself. 

I don’t want to trigger people. I don’t want every moment of my life to be dictated by how much I eat or how small I am. I don’t want to be winded walking across the house or feel happy when my body shows signs of suffering. I want to eat when my body is hungry and have little treats. I want to love my body the way I try to convince others to love theirs. I want to be healthy and maybe even strong. I don’t know how I’m going to get there. The thought is terrifying and I’ve made half ass attempts at “recovery” before, but this time feels different. 

I’m going to sit down with my safe roommate tonight and talk to him about everything. I think having someone who knows what I’m trying to do will be helpful. Maybe he can help me figure out some healthy goals as well. As much as I don’t want to, I’m going to leave these subs. I know a lot of content is recovery based, but I’ve been able to avoid that so far and I’m not going to pretend I can do better about it now. If anyone has suggestions for safe recovery subs to join, I’m all “ears”.

2259,2259,EDAnonymous,"For context, I’m a lesbian woman and while I don’t really have a type and find all bodies attractive, I have a thing for curvier women. 

I was looking at old pictures of myself at my HW. I always found myself unattractive at that weight and I wanted to be thinner so bad. And now I find myself more attractive on those pictures than I am now, after having lost all that weight? I looked healthier, not as dead inside, I don’t know. But I was borderline obese and I hated being fat. Is this a joke? I keep thinking “but I’d go for a woman with that type of body” but I can’t stand the idea of being fat again? I still want to lose more? What’s up with that? It would just make sense to recover and gain some weight back to feel better but fuck, I can’t. There’s a barrier in my mind that won’t let me. Even my crush told me I’m too skinny and that I looked better before and that’s not enough to convince me. I still have the same urge to lose more weight, even though I know it’ll probably just make me look worse and older. I have a bunch of good reasons to recover and I can’t let go. 

Nothing makes sense but do EDs ever make sense? I like curvy women. I didn’t like it when I was one. And now I feel like I was more attractive as one but I don’t want to be one again? Is it because I’m a minority (perceived, I don’t know how many people are actually more attracted to fuller figures) being attracted to that kind of body so I feel like no one else but me would find me attractive at that weight?

Over the past couple months, two or three people have commented that they've noticed my losing weight. (Out of concern, not encouragement or praise.) The strange bit - I've actually gained about &gt;!3 pounds!&lt;, increasing my bmi from around &gt;!17.2!&lt; to &gt;!17.5!&lt;. (I do understand that that's probably not a significant enough amount for anyone but myself to notice - just want to show that I'm definitely not actually thinner.) I've been exercising less than normal, so it's not increased muscle with decreased body fat. 

I'm so, so confused. The only thing I can think of is that maybe my winter wardrobe is creating slimmer proportions? Or, since people assume eating disorder means weight loss, they subconsciously see it happening?

I can't decide what to feel. It feels great to have people think I look thinner, especially because it means the weight gain isn't noticeable. I actually appreciate the concern. It's upsetting to think that showing more of my body in the summer makes me look heavier. This all is further decreasing my trust in others' perceptions. I also feel like I'm going batty lol

I have a good friend and she’s vaguely aware of my problems. She doesn’t know the full extent, but she knows the basics and that I’m trying to recover. Despite this, she keeps making these comments. They’re not on me though, they’re on herself. She’ll say things like “&gt;! Oh this is the first meal I’ve eaten in 2 days !&lt;“ in a “I’m so quirky and silly 🤪” way which due to a lot of practice I can usually ignore. However, recently things have been worse than usual mentally and every time she says that stuff I’ll still go into my “hey that’s not good, make sure you get enough nutrients your body needs it etc etc” thing but I also find myself getting triggered and annoyed. It all came into a tipping point a few weeks ago when we were jokingly looking at those bad design fail videos and she said, “&gt;! I’m so skinny I could probably fit through that. !&lt;“ I attempted changing the topic, knowing this could quickly turn bad but she continued saying, “ &gt;! Seriously, you could probably count all of my ribs and my hip bones just jut out! !&lt;“ after which she just laughed it off. This was a really bad day and all I could think about is this is it, all my recovery effort is about to go to waste. All my progress is going down the drain. So while tearing up I told her to stop and retold her I’m trying to recover and all of her comments she’s made since I started make it really difficult due to the competitive nature of an ED.

Dear all normally I wouldn’t be the person to write a post but I feel I really need some people to chat about my current state. 
I can usually talk with some people about my general problems that lie beneath my ed but regarding the disorder itself I never feel understood.

I have developed binge eating when I was about 15 years old because of self hate, bad body image and especially a difficult and toxic parental situation.
When I was about 18 it turned into the other extreme and I lost a lot of weight over a year. Since ca 2020 it has been that low and really slowly dropping about 3-4kg lower but not that extreme. I used to eat quite “normal” in high restriction and maintained my weight.

In summer I started developing night eating disorder and I was already fearing to fall back into my binging since it was the worst phase of my life and it just destroys me mentally.
Now since some month the binges got more frequent again and I can’t get control about getting up at night and starting to eat. I even started to kind of automatically walk into grocery shops rip bags open take some things out snack on them and leave again. Like wtf it is as if a robot is taking over me and I just completely zone out. My self hate and shame is at an all time high. Everyday I tell myself I will stop the next day but whatever I do I can’t. I know that some part of it might be extreme hunger but it mixes up with the habit and thoughts of binging and triggers these old behaviours. I also used to binge during the last years but I think I just labelled it differently and went on the next day.
But now I am just panicking about it which makes everything worse and hold up the vicious cycle.

I feel so disgusted by myself and my body and can’t recognise myself anymore. I am mentally so bad and am so scared that at one point the weight gain will be recognisable and then it’s the typical’oh you look good you are surely better aren’t you’ thing.

The strange thing is the more I feel I gained weight the more I want to eat and binge. Normally it was the other way round but my brain just seems to have developed a different coping mechanism.
Usually I would’ve diagnosed me as non purging bulimia - my cure was restricting the next day but now I just seem to not be able anymore

2293,2293,EDAnonymous,"My mom has extreme food aversion. We're almost certain she has ARFID, although it's not diagnosed. 

Since we were kids she would be disgusted by foods. She'd have to leave the room/house at party's when certain foods were cooking. The list seems to be constantly growing.

 I've been really worried about her for a long time but she's unwilling to try new foods. Ive noticed she's getting letters from cancer society. She's sleeping more than usual. She's taking equity loans on her house to help us (her children) out with things. I think she's dying. 

Ive been at her house 3mo and i never see her eat. Her diet consists of: 6 cans of coke a day. When she eats, it will be once or twice a week. She'll put some french fries in the convection oven. She recently started having chicken every sunday (thank god), ive seen her eat baked potatoes, chilli (with no beans), ground beef spaghetti, and that's really it. She'll eat kraft dinner bowls. I've also seen her eat out at places like: chinese food (chicken balls and rice), LOT's of plain pizza, she used to get this romaine salad from Wendy's, but wont eat that anymore. She likes ceasar salads.

Im looking for creative ways to add to her existing diets. I figure that if she does have cancer, eating twice a week is great for autophagy. However, when she does eat, i wish it would be nutrient rich meals. So far one of the ideas ive had was trying to get her into spinnach salads. (She hates textures so wouldn't eat it cooked, 100%).. she has a genuine phobia of food. No fish or seafood. Nothing with a weird name or weird smell or weird texture.

2303,2303,EDAnonymous,"TW: number, substance abuse 

Sorry if this ends up being a longer post. I just have a lot to get off my chest and it feels like there’s no one in my circle that I can talk to about this. 

During college I gained about &lt;!20!&gt; or so pounds. I didn’t have a great diet and I never exercised. But I don’t blame those things on my weight gain, I blame them on the antidepressants I was thrown on. I was misdiagnosed with BPD and the man who diagnosed me literally met me thirty minutes prior. I was already on the verge of a nervous breakdown because… well… college, so I went to the crisis center on campus and was then told by someone who just learned my name that I had a serious mental disorder. In the same breath, he said there was “nothing he could do for me” 

Fast forward, I was thrown on Zoloft. And when those didn’t work, they put me on Effexor. I don’t remember them being cautious either, like I just cold Turkey quit the Zoloft and hopped right into Effexor. When that wasn’t working, they decided to up my dosage. That is when I gained the weight. That’s also when my symptoms of my “personality disorder” got worse. The therapist I had at the time was no help either. 

2020 is when my eating disorder started. I had long since stopped taking meds and going to therapy. I began to restrict. I was already losing weight in 2019 as I started drinking less soda, eating out less, and exercising. I managed to lose the weight I gained. But I wanted to lose more and so my only option was to starve myself. I restricted my calories, kept my food on a tight regime, and was a couple of pounds shy from being considered underweight. people asked me what was wrong which made me feel so good. 

2020 into 2021 my eating disorder turned more bulimic as I started a binging and purging cycle. I think this is where I really destroyed my body. The worse thing I think I did was the laxatives.  I went through a box a month with those things. Eventually I developed food allergies to bananas, lettuce, and avocados during this time as well. My therapist at the time was started to cancel on me or ghost me on appointments. Anytime I mentioned my laxative abuse, she just shrugged and which told me that I can continue. 

In 2022; my therapist ghosted me for the last time and never answered my calls. I got a new therapist and after a few months into our sessions, he told me he I didn’t have BPD (even my old therapist said that I didn’t exhibit the symptoms but still kept me diagnosed with that) I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety and mood adjustment disorder. He says I may have adhd, but we haven’t done enough sessions to officially diagnose/rule out. Because of this, I was prescribed anxiety meds. 

I’ve only take three doses so far, and I’ve sobbed every single time. I’m getting body dysmorphia all ready and am thinking of all the unhealthy foods to get rid of in my apartment. I feel like I have finally reached a point where I tolerate my body, and I don’t want to mess things up. I made sure to tell the med manager that I don’t want pills that would cause weight gain. 

I don’t know.

2304,2304,EDAnonymous,"I'm 16FTM.

At the end of 2022 summer break, I started eating &gt;!600 cals!&lt;. It was great for maybe one to two months, until suddenly my weight loss stopped. I cried and cried, not understanding what was wrong with me. No one seemed to take me seriously, everyone was just so happy that I wasn't losing weight anymore, even though I was still starving myself. 

After two months of pure mental pain and suffering, I decided I'd eat more. My blood work showed no signs of thyroid problems or PCOS, so I thought maybe if I ate normally for a while my metabolism would fix itself and I could lose weight again! At first, eating more was supposed to only last a week. However, during the week I realized that eating more made me happier and more energetic (wow, what a crazy discovery!), so I decided I'd start recovery. I thought my body would fix itself after like &gt;!4 kilos!&lt;. I was wrong.

I'm now sitting at &gt;!59 kg!&lt;. &gt;!10 kg!&lt; heavier than at the start of the weight loss plateau. I'm back at the weight I was last spring, when I was crying every week about eating too much or being too heavy, and to no one's surprise, my mental state has also went back there. I'm way more dysphoric than before due to my thighs touching and binder wrinkling and I'm also suicidal because of the weight gain! Fun times.

When I asked in tears why my weight keeps going up, my school nurse just said it's because of the malnourishment. I don't 100% believe her, but I don't see any other explanations either. So yeah, starvation mode may actually exist. Again, fun times.

I wanted to post this on one of the big weight loss subs but I realized I'd probably be called a big fat LIAR just like I was when I cried about starving and still gaining weight in there lol.

each, and every time i bring it up, they tell me my bmi is not underweight ""so..."" and that ends it there. i get it can 100% be other things, but it is so frustrating telling them one thing and them brushing it off because i'm fat. like gee, thanks. and now there's the talk of PCOS, despite the fact i meet none of the symptoms except the fact ive had 2 simple cysts + weight.

2323,2323,EDAnonymous,"I don't think I technically meet the criteria of having an eating disorder, but this is the only place that would really understand I think.

I usually over-eat, find comfort in over-eating. There were periods I didn't have enough to eat as a kid and when I did have access to food it was always a heap of junk food accessible. But there is a history of anorexia in my family.

Every now and then something changes and it's like a flip is switched, and I stop Feeling hunger in the same way,  and I take pleasure in not eating and i get obsessed and then it's not really a choice and it becomes like an addiction and obsession, I misuse lax and plan how can I hide how little I'm eating until something happens and I end up really depressed and end up just wanting die instead.

 It's gotten worse each time it's happened, and it's happening more and more frequently, and I don't really get depressed anymore so I doubt that will stop me this time.

I'm obese, and so it's always been pretty easy to hide this, but over the years I have lost more and more weight.

And this time is a fucking doozy. I have slipped into it much quicker, and A friend asked to take his laxatives off him and told me how much weight he has lost in a short time, another friend recently developed schizophrenia and one of her delusions have stopped her eating. Nearly all of my friends have eds, and my partner has arfid and does not eat enough, which is only fuelling my behaviour 🤡 it fucking kills me. Like, I'm the token fatty?? Idk where this has come from, for the past three months I have felt good about myself, and been exercising and really toning up. And I ... Still don't feel that bad about my body. I am at my lowest weight I have been and most toned I have been and like... But I just feel embarrassed about not having ~control~ and ~discilplined~ and how obvious that must be, and how ~weak~ and ~inadequate~ and just less... Worthy I am. I feel like I am worth less than others and doing this will make me seem less idk childish and weak and gross.

But at the same time I know that's fucked up and that's not how I think of any other people but anytime I try to talk myself out of it I can't 🙃

I have lost &gt;!4 Kilos!&lt;  in 6 days, and it's just been .. easy. In the past there was always a level of struggle but there hasn't been any struggle to it this time. I know it's a lot of food and water weight but it just fuels me to keep going

2330,2330,EDAnonymous,"I used to struggle fairly bad with my ED a few years ago, but with time and some external support, I've gotten much better. I have been really supportive and loving towards myself these past few months, and I even got to a point where eating more than once a day does not drive me crazy and/or cause an anxiety attack.

That being said, the people in my close circle are giving me such a hard time without even realizing it. For context; a lot of my loved ones know that I have an ED, but ever since I have gradually gotten better and ""healthier,"" I feel like they have stopped caring about the things that they say or do around me. 

My friends will sometimes make comments about themselves (or others) and how they are disappointed in their body weight or size, my parents drop ignorant comments here and there, and mostly things of this sort. Recently though, my older brother decided to propose to his gf. My parents and relatives were talking about this situation near me, and lo and behold; some comments were made about her weight and how ""she is such a pretty girl, but would be even prettier if she dropped a few pounds."" Many more similar comments of this sort were made, and are STILL being made.

Firstly, it just bothers me how gross and judgemental some people can be.. like WHY make comments about other people and their bodies?? Secondly, they **all** know that I have been struggling for some time with an ED, and how triggering it is for me to hear things like this.

I have been sort of semi spiraling for the past 10ish days, and honestly can feel my old ways coming back shortly. I hate that I was doing so freaking well, but felt weak enough to be triggered by others.

2331,2331,EDAnonymous,"So far my eating disorder has consisted so much of punishments. Cold showers if you eat more than X. No rest days if you don't hit Y on the scale. No going out if you eat Z. I'm trying to ditch that, and I want to make recovery about rewarding myself for eating in *moderation*. Not binging, not restricting. However, I have a dilemma that makes finding a suitable reward feel impossible.

Growing up (and one of the leading reasons I developed BED) I had a parent who let life revolve around food. Namely, they would use food as a reward or let it coincide with any good experience. They were emotionally absent, but replaced love with food. Got all A's on a report card? Let's get ice cream. Got lead in the school play? That deserves a dinner out. It's a big holiday? Let's go splurge at the grocery store. Free time? Let's watch cooking shows and find a new recipe to make. I was often encouraged to eat more than I wanted and was told indirectly that my consuming the food I was given was the equivalent of accepting their love. So, I'm extremely ashamed to say that when I think of rewarding myself I think of food, but that just perpetuates the disorder. ""If I don't binge for 2 weeks, I'll buy myself a taro boba tea (I love those things)"", but that means restricting myself from that food for two weeks and putting it on a pedestal, othering it from the foods I normally eat, which is bound to create emotions good or bad surrounding it. 

But, that's not all! Both of my parents had a severe hoarding problem. And the one up above: When not using food to ""give"" love, they used material goods. They are pretty well off and would shower me with gifts in lieu of their presence and emotional energy. If I was ever depressed or suicidal, when not taking me out to eat, they preferred to take me on shopping sprees, buy me new toys, throw me some new clothes, than actually talk to me about what was going on. It's the main reason why my love languages are a blend of a bit of everything except gift-giving. Receiving physical gifts from people generally makes me feel sick and anxious. Seeing as I had a lot of siblings, and all these attempts at replacing emotional presence for us added up, our house ended up filthy, packed to the brim with evidence of their attempt to override emotional absence. I am not minimalist by any means, but buying things makes me feel anxious and bad. I do not like cluttering my living space and will even have panic attacks over buying new clothes or the like. That's why I prefer goods that can be ""used up"", and, unfortunately, the first thing that comes to mind is food.

By the end of this thought process, I feel like the best bet is to reward myself with an experience, but I don't know what. There isn't much I like to do that I don't do already.

Sometimes I have do have physical hunger pangs, but most of the time I'm just fine. The worst is the psychological pangs. It happens at night generally, I can go crazy because of sushi and ramen taste and images flashing before my eyes. It goes away in 30 min. 

What I do to satisfy my ""psychological hunger"" is looking at vegan whole food recipes on tiktok. It's really satisfying because cooking inspiration, and sometimes I imagine the feeling of eating it, or cooking it and serving the meals to all my friends and I'm extremely satisfied. It really shows to me how much of hunger and craving is actually 85% psychological rather than physical. 

I'm on week 2 of my fast, still not on my gw. But once I reach it I will ask myself the 30 million dollar question : when and how do I break my fast? And how do I maintain and not trigger binges??? I know I'm an idiot for fasting for weight loss in the first place, but even i know the bigger battle than weight loss is maintaining + not binging. 

My idea is : I'll fast until I'm one of 2 kilos below my gw. Then I'll start eating one meal every 3 days, especially the meals that I have been particularly craving (ramen, gyozas, sushi, tuna sub). I'll gain some weight back because that is what happens anyway after a fast even if you just suck on celery sticks. But I'll be at my goal weight then.

2347,2347,EDAnonymous,"I’ve had “ anorexia” since I was around 11 years old, and ARFID for as long as I remember (I guess the anorexia would be ARFID+, but I’m not a fan of that label and see it as two separate issues for me. My ARFID feels too separate from my anorexia and vice versa.) The anorexia started at 11 for not body image issues but to gain some control over my life because of trauma, mental health in general, intrusive thoughts, etc. when that was no longer enough to fuel it, it switched to the typical anorexia featuring body image issues, probably partially because I found the ED community online and my self esteem was always wrecked. It turned into this fully. 

I ended up in a weird place with my family, who would force feed me without getting me treatment and being on my back about it. Eventually, I decided to recover for myself, and had a bit of a struggle phase with that but eventually achieved in my opinion full recovery. And I was happy, so truly happy for awhile. I thought even the most impossible things to cure were cured, like the depression. 

Then a global pandemic happened. This reset a lot of things for me, but my eating disorder wasn’t affected yet, but there was cracks starting to appear subconsciously because I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and found my weight starting to tiptoe into the overweight category. I still didn’t focus too hard on it right away. After all bmi charts aren’t everything. But it kept going like this, and I didn’t even eat much just started to eat normal even though I still had ARFID. I made some strides with ARFID too but I will admit that never left, but at the time I didn’t even know that was disorderly at all. 

My weight kept creeping up and it was at a point where I couldn’t ignore it bugging me. I made an edtwt account to just be a bit snarky on about it without really relapsing, but not wanting people to bug me about how unhealthy it was or freak out at me for relapsing, although this is probably a start for relapsing. The account was deactivated because people discovered it was mine which lead to a lot of drama / shame. 

Leading up to this I knew I’d be moving onto my college campus soon. I was worried this would make me relapse, as I know me being fully in charge of taking care of myself is a… recipe for disaster? Especially because I’d have to walk OUTSIDE for it and stuff so there’s no more convenience? When I moved in though I was good, but the food was kinda bad for my ARFID issues, and I found myself in a tug of war with going to the dining hall or not. Eventually that started to slip, and I also found myself focusing on the ED community again. I relapsed on my anorexia but I was in denial about it because I had a day where I’d eat a normal big meal, with my uncle, at my favorite restaurant, and that I wasn’t “intentionally doing it.” But that didn’t make me living off of vending machine nuts or small bags of chips any better. And I really started hating on my body and anxious about how others perceived it. 

In December I went a whole week off little bags of nuts from the vending machine and that’s it until I started feeling really weird symptoms like internal shaking but not outside shaking, the weirdest emotions, uncontrollable tears, dizziness, and weird feelings in my heart. I forced myself to eat at the dining hall after all day of feeling those symptoms. Later that week there was judgements for resident hall Christmas decorations and we were all asked to come and we’d get cookies which I came for originally, but found myself unbearingly overwhelmed about my body size and being seen by others in the hall and left without cookies. 

Now more recently on break I’ve been having full on ED thoughts. I’ve been doing everything that triggers me: wintergirls, thinspo, bonespo, edtwt, looking at post photos of myself, weighing myself, planning on being a better anorexic, etc. I’ve been fantasizing about going back after break is over (I can’t really be a “good” anorexic here. I have to eat normal here) will be. I’ve been thinking about how great it would be to keep living off nuts but also going to the campus gym more because I’m already paying for it anyway, what the thin version of myself would be, about how I need to do this because my hypothyroid made me blow up so much in weight, etc. it doesn’t help I got sent very triggering comments from abusers basically telling me unprompted that I let myself go and that I am not anorexic nor ever was anorexic and all this shit, calling me fat, ugly, undesirable… basically any meanspo type comment ever that’s made worse by the unsolicited nature of it all. I want to be a “good anorexic” again to prove them wrong, and make everyone worried about me again, all while I would achieve what a “good anorexic” is about with a new ultimate goal weight and everything. 

But… is that what I want? I don’t want to fuck up my GPA. I don’t want to have health issues. I don’t want to feel as shitty as I did when I know I was in the thick of it because I was hallucinating then from the lack of nutrients. I got sent a beautiful message the other day from someone I met from edtwt who went to recovery not long after I met them about how I should recover too and totally do it and how I should do it because I want to be able to have babies and I deserve recovery which made me cry because it was all true and validated my feelings. So I want recovery.

But is that what I want either? No. My mind is being very toxic right now about how I need to do this for at least a little while because of my BMI and what hypothyroidism done to me and that nows my opportunity to be able to feel that euphoria from restricting again which I have truly missed. And feel like I need because so much is going wrong for me right now and it all falls back into control issues deep down and I just miss being sick again and the things I romanticized about it all.

My mind is so toxic. I’m here crying because I don’t know what I want and I don’t know if I care enough to want better anymore and feel so guilty about how I threw that recovery era all away but I now also loathe that era more than anything. I don’t know.

2357,2357,EDAnonymous,"I have a restrictive type eating disorder and restrict my intake. Even if I am not trying to lose weight, I can't go above a certain range I have set up for me.

Today was decently good. I wasn't very hungry today so I didn't go above like &gt;!1400!&lt;. Not very active, not very hungry. Quite satisfied, actually.

I try to follow some sort of meal plan and had a banana with whip as my night snack. And then my mom and I decided to try some new ice cream. I did not like it at all, but I ate *at least* two servings straight from the tub, maybe three. 

After that I felt super shitty about myself. I was disappointed in not listening to my hunger cues. My mother also brought up school and I got incredibly anxious so I thought maybe if I made myself sick I could skip the day. So I ate more. Only I decided I was going to eat a giant cookie I threw in my trashcan last night since I didn't like it. I'm fucking disgusting.

So now I have a banana, like 3 ice cream sundaes, and a &gt;!500!&lt; calorie cookie &gt;!that I could barely eat without throwing up, like I was actually gagging!&lt;sitting in my stomach and I feel awful.

2361,2361,EDAnonymous,"I’m a mid-30’s woman of average build with a healthy range BMI, but I was a chubby kid. By no means obese, but carried more weight than my very skinny peers. I played a lot of sports, so it wasn’t all fat, but I was a bulky girl.

When I was 13, I went to my pediatrician for my annual physical. My pediatrician made a comment like “Wow! You weigh a lot, but you wear your weight well. I never would have guessed you weigh that much.” I had never once thought about my weight before. I mean, I noticed I wasn’t built like the other kids, but it never triggered anything in me. But from that appointment forward, it was all I could think about. 

I dropped 40lbs in 3 months that summer before starting high-school because I didn’t want to be the fat girl, but that led to years of disordered eating. Between dance, musicals, swim team, (and less so but also the fact that we were on food stamps and didn’t have a lot of food to go around anyway, but not nearly as much), it just got out of hand.

My life was pretty out of control (see food stamps, also my house being foreclosed on every other month, my single mom never being home, running our household as a teen while also trying to go to school, relationship issues, normal teen struggles, etc). Counting calories gave me something to focus on. The lower the number got, the more secret pride I carried. Then it turned into number of days I could go without eating. The higher the number got, the more my secret joy grew. I once went 12.5 days before someone forced me to eat in front of them while locked into their car. I was incredibly proud of that number, which I clung to like a shield. 

Surprisingly, when I left for college and ended up in a stable relationship, it all stopped. I ate like a normal person. I gained like 30lbs my freshman year, but it was weight restoration that probably should have happened long before that. 

For the next decade, I had little relapses every time life got too stressful. Every time, I knew what was happening. I knew it was unhealthy. I knew it was me trying to cope with big feelings. I knew it wouldn’t help long term. But I couldn’t stop anyway. And I don’t know why. It’s like an argument in my brain with a very compelling and stubborn opponent with a lot of willpower. I never won the argument, it was always just a waiting game until my life stressors improved and food just kind of faded into the background again.

So here we go again. My dog, my precious pup, my baby boy, my whole world, and my biggest source of support and coping skills over the last 7 years, suddenly became ill and passed shortly after. I am devastated and grief has completely consumed my life. I am depressed, angry, anxious, sad, tired, and barely holding it together in my daily life. I haven’t had a day in the last month when I haven’t cried my eyes out at least once. 

So of course I’m also down an unhealthy amount of weight. The depression has killed my appetite. The anxiety makes me nauseated anytime I try to eat anyway. But there’s also the part of my brain that finds solace in literally losing myself in the numbers. 

Every other time, it’s just been a matter of waiting for my life stressors to resolve. But how do I resolve a loss that won’t change? How do I work through the grief and convince myself to eat through it? Especially when I’m just mid-sized and may people probably think I could probably stand to lose a few pounds anyway and thus it seems justifiable to anyone watching…",,Ugh.

2363,2363,EDAnonymous,"I say this thinking specifically of my just turned thirteen year old niece. She's a wonderful, gorgeous, smart beyond her years girl who has been through so much trauma for someone so young and she kind of reminds me of myself at her age, and that worries the hell out of me. 

She comes to visit her uncle, my husband, and I during the summers for a few weeks at a time, and I noticed a few things that made me really anxious the last time she was staying with us. 

She's super into TikTok and Pinterest (duh, she's a baby Gen-Z lmao) and those are platforms I know from personal experience can have enough algorithmic generated content to nudge a vulnerable young person into the start of eating disordered behaviors-- and this might sound so dumb, but I noticed she only wants to drink Diet Coke, and I can assume based on what she does show me of her feeds that she's beginning to get that type of content on her FYP. Like, the kind that it's a joke but not really a joke IFYKYK type of videos about the ✨ aesthetic ✨ of being a Diet Coke Girly™️. (I'm kind of blaming myself for this, as I made a joke to her uncle about the calories and immediately afterward she said she wanted diet soda instead of the regular we used to get for her.)

I also noticed that she doesn't eat a lot, and it may be just that she's not into the meals we make and is too sweet and polite to tell us so, but she would skip breakfast and lunch, eat a small portion of dinner and was wholly uninterested in little junk food excursions or snacks or anything like that she used to be into even 6 months before that particular visit.

It could be totally normal behavior that I'm just contextualizing incorrectly based on my own experiences, but god damn does it worry me. I don't want this lovely young woman to fall into this vicious cycle. The things she's been through are enough to break grown adults, and the events I have in mind, like her father passing, happened when she was very young, but she's right at the age where people begin to process their experiences and start comparing them to their peers, and trauma is a huge factor in developing an ED. Add the stress of puberty, changing schools, and all the other shit that comes with becoming a teenager and I'm so, so concerned.

She's an oldest child too, her mom works incredibly hard and is gone a lot, and that also worries me because I don't know if she would feel comfortable talking to anyone in her life, and I ended up turning to the wrong kind of communities online when I was in that position and it really threw me full force into my ED.

2382,2382,EDAnonymous,"This isn’t anything new to me. 90% of my thoughts throughout my day are focused on food/calories, whether I should give into binge urges, planning out meals, looking at meal ideas online, thinking about what I ate or will eat. My brain has been preoccupied with thoughts around food ever since my ED began ten years ago. I’ve also struggled with my sleep for a few years, having random spurts of insomnia despite creating a routine full of exercise and self care. 

Im pulling myself out of a binge phase (which makes me super vulnerable to falling back into one) and I am back to my normal restriction. I don’t count cals anymore and I eat probably a couple hundred under my BMR. So in my mind it’s enough food (even though I know I’m mentally and physically restricting still). I also live with my family and due to their eating habits, I’m constantly in an environment surrounded by trigger/unsafe foods, so binging is always easily accessible for me at any moment. 

Lately I haven’t been able to sleep because my brain is so busy romanticizing food and thinking about foods, whether it be binge foods or safe foods. It’s more so mental hunger I think. Just this past week I’ve had 3 nights where I only slept for about an hour and then spent the rest of the night with my mind spinning. Ive gotten really good at using harm reduction techniques to avoid spiraling into a binge, but I am just so tired - mentally and physically.

My body has never looked ‘right’ in my eyes. Growing up I always thought I was literally the only person in the world with defined hip dips. Recently I noticed my sister has them too. She looks great and I love my little sister. But I feel so alien. No matter how much I lose/gain, my hips are non existent. Can’t wear certain dresses/leggings due to my insecurity. I know it’s natural and due to bone structure. Maybe if I work out a certain way it will help? I see realistic bodies with hip dips and seriously, I haven’t seen any as severe as mine.

Anyway. I’m losing my ass and boobs. I want to feel feminine again. I want my fiancé to find me attractive and I know he does but anyone would prefer at least 10 more pounds on me. 

I can’t find bras that fit, I don’t wear them but I don’t know how to measure myself. I’m tired of seeing myself as an alien, but if I gain 5 pounds I’m dumpy In my eyes. I have no muscle or definition and will forever be skinny fat unless I become a fitness chick. I am too depressed to do anything but work and lay in bed. I can’t call this a life

This morning she triggered me so bad when I went to throw out the evidence. She started questioning what I was throwing out, to which I kept lying and saying it was just scrap papers, etc. and for her to NOT LOOK in the bags. She ended up cleaning my room suspiciously, which broke my trust in her because I thought she would respect my wish for her to NOT CHECK.

2398,2398,EDAnonymous,"To make a long story short, I, 26F, relapsed into AN-R again and am at a point where people are starting to comment that they are very concerned for my health. My boyfriend is completely new to this and doesn't understand eating disorders, and didn't see this happening over the last three months, though my mother definitely knew right away.

Last night after my massage therapist sternly told me that I need to gain weight and I have dangerously low muscle mass, I panicked and my boyfriend and I got in a huge fight about my relapse. He feels helpless and so do I. I am not ready to recover. I am so terrified of falling back into bulimia like I did in 2019. I ended up eating a TON with him last night. My hunger switch flipped and I was just so hungry. I have also been sick for a week and exercising a ton lately. I ate so so so much last night and then again today. I couldn't stop. I know this happens. I know it's a biological response. But I am so terrified two days of 'overeating' is going to throw my weight way way up and i won't be able to regulate my eating anymore.

I am terrified this disease will destroy another relationship. I can commit to at least harm reduction of not losing more. 

Is it possible to make it through the two binge days without too much damage and then just learn to maintain for now? I feel so exceptionally out of control and so panicked. How do I just maintain?

So I've realized that my main fear is the idea that there are some food which will give me bad luck, meanwhile there are other certain type of food in which any case if ate I'm gonna be okay.

Today I fear everything that ain't vegan and is not keto. ""Every type of meat will give me bad luck and everything that contain sugar too.""

My life is based in that idea since 2018 and I don't know if I'm gonna over it and I don't even know if I want to change that really.

I know it's not normal but I cannot figure another way of living now. 

I basically grew up and mature while doing this and I'm afraid to lose control if I stand out of this line I drew myself into.

I also have to mention that my life was a mess before this and in some way, when I started doing this, things started to change for better. So, it's been kind of hard dealing with this fear since I don't want to be where I was before 2018.

2405,2405,EDAnonymous,"Hey y'all. So I've been steadily losing weight, and I was doing it slowly at first. Over the course of 3 months I'd lost 9 pounds so nothing crazy right? 

Then I started restricting further. My ed is getting worse. And my psychiatrist praising me for losing weight isn't helping anything. She thinks she's being encouraging but in reality she's helping to fuel thoughts. 

Well, she's now concerned for me as I lost 7 pounds in the last week. 7 whole pounds in one week. I know that isn't all that much but it still feels like a crazy amount considering it took me 3 months to lose just slightly more than that. 

I wouldn't say I'm concerned for myself but this is just kinda opening my eyes to the fact that I'm sick. I mean if I can lose that much in just a week what happens if I keep going? Will I finally be able to reach my gw?  But now I feel like my psychiatrist is going to be watching me closer.

Here's my problem

I relapsed into a restrictive ed 2 weeks before my quarterly exams come up *(4 per year, overall 25% of final grade, you get it.) (the actual exams last 4 days).* I've been eating around 550kcal everyday since relapse, and I figured I need to up my intake for exam days (*I was thinking: 800-1200 kcal?).* 

I am scared as FUCK to do that for the ff dumb anorexia reasons:

* I wont be able to return to my usual limit after upping my intake because of ""losing control"" 
* I'll just eat and eat and eat until I'm back at my highest weight, or even more
* And, its embarrassing, but most of all I'm scared it'll make me want to recover. 

I just want a balance. Something that will let me not spiral out of control, while still eating enough to let my brain function. Btw, I'm not interested in recovery as of the moment. I would prefer advice on how to, I guess, make a compromise between health and not health.

2425,2425,EDAnonymous,"if you started improving while you waited for an admit date? 

i just feel like the only reason im holding onto this relapse is so that i can still be 
sick when i go. 

and also because i feel like it's just so hard to process all the thoughts and feelings related to a relapse, that if i were to start doing better, these thoughts and feelings would change and then i'd be stuck trying to re-process all of them as soon as i get there.

and also, because i feel like if i were to go when i 'wasn't as sick,' that maybe i didn't deserve to be there and that maybe someone else needs my spot more.

i don't think this is 'the ed talking' (f---
that phrase!) because i do want to get better! it's just that i don't want to show up and go through it all if im 'better' but don't want to waste an opportunity when it could help me *actually* get better. 

part of me wants to 'save' treatment for when i'm worse, if that makes sense in a twisted way. as if my ed is tempting me to get worse in the meantime? 'you know you can get worse, why are you caving now??' -ED, probably

all this being said, i've had an ed for 20 years, i keep relapsing, i am pregnant, and it's hard to get into treatment even when im literally dying. maybe the point of my post is- do i even need treatment when im not as bad as i've gotten before? and how do i rectify 'doing better' before i get there?

2429,2429,EDAnonymous,"Kind of a rant, kind of wondering if anyone else knows what I mean/recognizes these thoughts. 

So I was on a birth control a little over a year ago that made me gain like 20 pounds and I was really depressed. At my heaviest I was 160 at 5'2. My family had a lot to say when I was heavier and it was humiliating and still hurts to think about.

I think I've always had unhealthy ideas about food and my body but since August it's evolved into a lot of restricting and compulsive movement. I'm 143 on a good day now, but can fluctuate up to 145. Still not at my goal but I think I look better and it's at least a healthier BMI. 

Anyway, I don't eat all day and it made me lose weight. My family has comments for that too, and they are more positive now. Part of me is like, yes! I did it!! But then the other part is like ""hey mom do you wanna know how I lost all this weight?"" 

Like, they don't care how I did it, that this isn't healthy for me, you know? They're just glad I'm easier to look at. I know on some level that this isn't healthy and i should eat, I just keep telling myself that I can go back to eating normally when I reach my goal. I know I'm in a bad cycle, but I still believe I can stop at my goal at the same time. 

Their compliments makes me feel like starving myself is good, actually. It kinda pisses me off, they like me better starving. Every time I go over I hear ""did you lose weight?"" Even if I haven't since the last time I saw them (which is like every week). Every time I hear that I just feel reinforced in my routine. My mom even told me ""your face looks better"" like wow thanks.

2430,2430,EDAnonymous,"I'm 18F and have been suffering with an eating disorder for three years. My diagnosis is ARFID, though I also secretly have struggled with anorexia as well.

Since starting recovery I gained a total of &gt;!30 lbs!&lt;, pushing me from severely UW to just on the brink of a health BMI. For months, I had no extreme hunger (it was really only present this time last year) or binge urges.

Recently that has changed though. I have begun thinking of food a lot more, specifically sweets. I try my best to eat sweets through the day like sweet drinks, chocolate candies, chocolate covered protein bars (not an ED thing, always loved them), yogurts, fruits, etc. For some reason though I still am craving them at the end of the day. Honestly, I am becoming scared.

Last night, for example, I ate an entire pint of ice cream. However, this was after a day of high activity and under eating due to stress so it made sense in the situation and I decided to just move on. It was basically my dinner, anyways. ~~I had a 5 hr shift on a busy night. We only had fritos. Ew.~~

Today I tried my best, got home from school and ate 2 bowls of ice cream. I had dinner 2 hours later and felt so full afterwards, but not even 30 minutes later I had another bowl and cleared a half pint of ice cream.

According to my meal plan, I am not supposed to eat again until 8PM anyways, so I did feel guilty about this.

And even though I honored my mental hunger and ate ice cream, I have been thinking about the brownies in the fridge for a *week*. But I JUST had ice cream, I've been having these mini ""feasts,"" ""indulgences,"" or whatever every night for the past week, and they have only gotten bigger the more I put off eating certain things.

I'm scared that if I don't eat the brownie, I will only keep thinking about it and eating anything to satisfy the urge of eating it. At the same time, I'm afraid if I eat it, I'll want more. I'm afraid that if I eat it, I'll gain loads of weight. ~~I've gained like 1lb this week. I healthy weight gain, but freaking me out nontheless.~~

I've been less active recently, I've been eating more, my teeth will get cavities, I'll balloon up. It's a big brownie - I know how many calories are in it and it's a lot. I can think of a million reasons to not eat the brownie, but maybe if I eat the brownie, I will just stop thinking about it.",,Feeling lost.
