I gained 40 lbs in one year. \\n\\nGrowing up, I was always fat shamed even though at the time I was 120 and 5’5. As you can guess, this set me down a spiral where I would stress eat and actually become fat. \\n\\nI would always make excuses to not workout or to not binge. I was miserable. It was obvious that people had notice my weight gain and they all started treating me quickly. My senior year of high school was hell. \\n\\nFirst year of college, I was away from home and started to feel independent. Skip forward, I got a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with BED. It was nothing new really. However, just two weeks ago, he prescribed me vyvanse and it so far has significantly changed my life. \\n\\nVyvanse is not a weight loss drug, but it is meant to suppress your impulses and binge like tendencies. Its been only 1.5 week and I have already loss nearly 10 pounds since the beginning of January. \\n\\nHowever, I have also been working out. Nothing too intense really, just walking for 30 minutes on a treadmill with an incline. Vyvanse is also prescribed for patients with ADHD, and I have never felt more productive and social in my life. I no longer care of how people think about me and because I have been keeping myself busy, I haven’t thought about food as much as I usually do. In my experience, its also kind of like an appetite suppressant but don’t quote me on that.\\n\\nVyvanse is very expensive, and I just feel so fortunate that my insurance covers it. Although the weight loss and change is minimal, I already fell so much better- like there is hope for me. \\n\\nJust a little rant :)</td>\n",

You can put a banana or two and a whole mango and some orange juice and blend it up. It’s like a drink but has lots of food in it. It might not work for everyone but it really helped me in my recovery  \n",

I started eating really unhealthy amounts of food. This continued for a while and I felt weak and tired all the time. I tried to recover and then relapsed again. I started to recover again at the start of December and it’s going really well. Especially in the last week. I went from a full meal a day to Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and snacks. I have so much more energy and all my headaches are gone. I know I have a long way to go get but I am really proud of how far I have come. I know it’s hard sometimes but please keep pushing through it and you will be so much healthier and happier. Please know that you can message me if you ever need help and that there are people out there that care and will listen to you  \n",

It just seems like this will be life long for me. I was only 11 years old when this illness came on. I look back and feel sad that as a child I was tormented by this disease. I didn’t know how to cope with it. Now I recognize my triggers but it’s still hard to live with.  \n",

I promise it gets better. I am living a life right now that I couldn't have *imagined* 2 years ago. I have a boyfriend, straight A's, lots of friends, a vibrant social life, great mental health, I eat whatever I want, and most importantly: a healthy state of mind. \\n\\nI went through hell and back but I made it, and if I made it, you can too. If you ever need someone to talk to or need advice, my DMs are open. Much love to you all  \n",

I can do the normal life things I need to do, but notably it is a HUGE help with my binging disorder. The medication really helps me to manage impulses surrounding binging. \\n\\nIt also completely erases my appetite, but I’m making the effort to have multiple healthy meals every day so I’m not accidentally starving myself. So far it’s been one solid month and I’ve lost around 10lbs! That sounds like a lot, but my starting weight was 315lbs, so this needs to happen for my health and wellness. Looking forward to getting into the 200s again:)  \n",

       "24124  For context, I have always had a binge eating disorder. However, during covid it hit a huge spike. I gained 40 lbs in one year. \\n\\nGrowing up, I was always fat shamed even though at the time I was 120 and 5’5. As you can guess, this set me down a spiral where I would stress eat and actually become fat. \\n\\nI would always make excuses to not workout or to not binge. I was miserable. It was obvious that people had notice my weight gain and they all started treating me quickly. My senior year of high school was hell. \\n\\nFirst year of college, I was away from home and started to feel independent. Skip forward, I got a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with BED. It was nothing new really. However, just two weeks ago, he prescribed me vyvanse and it so far has significantly changed my life. \\n\\nVyvanse is not a weight loss drug, but it is meant to suppress your impulses and binge like tendencies. Its been only 1.5 week and I have already loss nearly 10 pounds since the beginning of January. \\n\\nHowever, I have also been working out. Nothing too intense really, just walking for 30 minutes on a treadmill with an incline. Vyvanse is also prescribed for patients with ADHD, and I have never felt more productive and social in my life. I no longer care of how people think about me and because I have been keeping myself busy, I haven’t thought about food as much as I usually do. In my experience, its also kind of like an appetite suppressant but don’t quote me on that.\\n\\nVyvanse is very expensive, and I just feel so fortunate that my insurance covers it. Although the weight loss and change is minimal, I already fell so much better- like there is hope for me. \\n\\nJust a little rant :)  \n",

Long story short - I used to struggle with anorexia/restrictive eating for years when I was younger. I thought I recovered, but I think what actually happened was I was so afraid of going down the Ana ED road again, that I actually swung my pendulum in the other direction and developed BED; I’ve put on just, a ridiculous amount of weight over the years and when I try to diet or get healthy, those intense fears of anorexia come flooding back and I instinctively binge to prove I’m “recovered”. Honestly though, the guilt and self hatred never went away, just the below numbers on the scale. I just want to be healthy. 😞  \n",

       "      <td>First: What is ACC’s function?\\nChat GPT:\\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a brain region that is involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional processes. Some of its functions include:\\nError detection and monitoring: The ACC is activated when a person detects an error or discrepancy in their own behavior or in the behavior of others.\\nConflict resolution: The ACC is involved in resolving conflicts between different mental processes, such as between a habitual response and a newly learned response.\\nEmotion regulation: The ACC is activated when a person is trying to regulate their emotional responses, such as when trying to suppress an emotional reaction.\\nPain perception and processing: The ACC is involved in the processing of pain and is activated in response to painful stimuli.\\nDecision making: The ACC is involved in decision making, particularly in situations where there is a high degree of uncertainty or conflict between different options.\\nAttention regulation: The ACC is also thought to play a role in attention regulation, it is activated when a person is shifting attention between different tasks, or when attention is focused on a task.\\nHow is Binge Eating Disorder related to ACC?\\nChat GPT:\\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a region of the brain that plays an important role in a wide variety of cognitive and emotional processes, including attention, decision-making, and error detection. In relation with Binge Eating Disorder, It has been found in brain imaging studies that people with BED have increased activity in the ACC as well as other brain regions that are involved in reward processing, emotion regulation, and impulse control. These brain regions are thought to be involved in the overvaluation of food and the inability to resist the urge to eat in the context of BED.\\nAdditionally, people with BED have been found to have abnormal functioning in the brain’s reward systems, which are also involved in the regulation of emotions and stress response. Therefore, BED is associated with abnormal activity in the ACC and other brain regions involved in reward processing, emotion regulation, and impulse control.\\n_\\nWith Anorexia Nervosa, the gray brain matter is smaller.\\nOur ancestors would actually over eat, and eat on the average of two meals a day so binge eating disorder is evolutionary.</td>\n",

I am seeking candidates to participate in an interview involving intergenerational transmission of disordered eating. The interview will involve in-depth questions regarding eating behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that an individual with disordered eating possesses, their experiences in their own family of origin, and their thoughts about how they will or are parenting their children.\\n\\nTo participate in this study, please reach out to me at Hentkowski0243@MissouriState.edu\\n\\nYou will be sent a questionnaire via email to assess eligibility for the study, then I may reach out to you to schedule an interview on Zoom.  \n",
       "7495   First: What is ACC’s function?\\nChat GPT:\\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a brain region that is involved in a variety of cognitive and emotional processes. Some of its functions include:\\nError detection and monitoring: The ACC is activated when a person detects an error or discrepancy in their own behavior or in the behavior of others.\\nConflict resolution: The ACC is involved in resolving conflicts between different mental processes, such as between a habitual response and a newly learned response.\\nEmotion regulation: The ACC is activated when a person is trying to regulate their emotional responses, such as when trying to suppress an emotional reaction.\\nPain perception and processing: The ACC is involved in the processing of pain and is activated in response to painful stimuli.\\nDecision making: The ACC is involved in decision making, particularly in situations where there is a high degree of uncertainty or conflict between different options.\\nAttention regulation: The ACC is also thought to play a role in attention regulation, it is activated when a person is shifting attention between different tasks, or when attention is focused on a task.\\nHow is Binge Eating Disorder related to ACC?\\nChat GPT:\\nThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a region of the brain that plays an important role in a wide variety of cognitive and emotional processes, including attention, decision-making, and error detection. In relation with Binge Eating Disorder, It has been found in brain imaging studies that people with BED have increased activity in the ACC as well as other brain regions that are involved in reward processing, emotion regulation, and impulse control. These brain regions are thought to be involved in the overvaluation of food and the inability to resist the urge to eat in the context of BED.\\nAdditionally, people with BED have been found to have abnormal functioning in the brain’s reward systems, which are also involved in the regulation of emotions and stress response. Therefore, BED is associated with abnormal activity in the ACC and other brain regions involved in reward processing, emotion regulation, and impulse control.\\n_\\nWith Anorexia Nervosa, the gray brain matter is smaller.\\nOur ancestors would actually over eat, and eat on the average of two meals a day so binge eating disorder is evolutionary.  \n",

I have been struggling with a binge eating disorder since I was 14 (I'm 21 now), and I've been on the road to recovery for a few years. I'm an interior design student at SCAD, and for my senior thesis, I'm going to design a recovery center for people who struggle with eating disorders.\\n\\nI am in the research phase and want to gather as much data as possible to make my design the best it can be! I've copied a link below to a Google survey I create for people to share their experience with disordered eating. All the responses will be kept anonymous, and I would appreciate if you guys could check it out! \\n\\nSurvey link: [https://forms.gle/2P29Uqc7bcBYrC776](https://forms.gle/2P29Uqc7bcBYrC776)  \n",

This is mainly in regards to socially eating. So I have a group of friends that are foodies and basically want to go out to eat a lot. I love hanging out with them, but every time I hang out with them, the event revolves around food or going to a restaurant. Every time I go and eat with them, I feel immense guilt and self-hatred afterwards. Even if the food is super good, I still hate myself afterwards. My closest friend in that group has reassured me that it will be okay if I have a day where I eat good food. She has even said that life is too short for bad food. I want to feel empowered by that, but I just can’t. When I eat food at a restaurant, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wrong and disgusting. I feel like I’m going to go back to my old ways and I’m just super negative in my head after I go out to eat with them. Also I feel like if I go and say no to food, people are going to ask me why and I just don’t feel like telling them a whole story. I love hanging out with them, but I don’t know what to do to resolve my bad emotions.</td>\n",

I don't know. But for me bingeing is the reward, purging or restricting was punishment. So I've worked on that A lot. I'm definitely not seeing it as a reward but I miss that connection with food if that makes sense. Right now I'm reward craving so badly but have nothing to fill that crave, any advice?</td>\n",

       "39     I’m recovering from BED and haven’t binged in probably six months. I’m proud of the progress I have made, but I’m still going through some mental anguish. This is mainly in regards to socially eating. So I have a group of friends that are foodies and basically want to go out to eat a lot. I love hanging out with them, but every time I hang out with them, the event revolves around food or going to a restaurant. Every time I go and eat with them, I feel immense guilt and self-hatred afterwards. Even if the food is super good, I still hate myself afterwards. My closest friend in that group has reassured me that it will be okay if I have a day where I eat good food. She has even said that life is too short for bad food. I want to feel empowered by that, but I just can’t. When I eat food at a restaurant, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wrong and disgusting. I feel like I’m going to go back to my old ways and I’m just super negative in my head after I go out to eat with them. Also I feel like if I go and say no to food, people are going to ask me why and I just don’t feel like telling them a whole story. I love hanging out with them, but I don’t know what to do to resolve my bad emotions.  \n",

Like the title says, I'm about to start a job in an inpatient ED clinic (I'm currently working in the same psych hospital so I'm familiar with inpatient treatment but not the ED unit in particular).  I don't have much personal experience with eating disorders but obviously I want to not screw this up.  I was wondering if any of you lovely people who have had experience with inpatient treatment (or other intensive treatment) have any tips/advice?  As in, was there anything particularly helpful or therapeutic for you (or not helpful, that you wish staff had done differently)?  No pressure to answer this of course, but any insight is appreciated :)  \n",

I don't know. But for me bingeing is the reward, purging or restricting was punishment. So I've worked on that A lot. I'm definitely not seeing it as a reward but I miss that connection with food if that makes sense. Right now I'm reward craving so badly but have nothing to fill that crave, any advice?  \n",

I eat because i am stressed. \\n\\nI have bpd, and i thought i was doing awesome in coping, because i realised, i hadnt been getting super anxious anymore and spiralling much.... till i realised instead, ive been binging :(   \\nYet, 5 mins of feeling sick, i want to eat again!!! I think i have eaten more i the past week than i have the past month. \\n\\nI dont have my next therapy session until end of Jan, so i am trying to reach out to get any tips anyone has that have successfully worked. Unfortunately, i also have chronic fatigue syndrome so tips of exercise whilst i try and do what i can, i am housebound quite a lot.  \n",
