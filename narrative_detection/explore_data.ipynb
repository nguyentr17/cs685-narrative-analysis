       "      <td>Hi guys. This is kinda a diary post, but I want to share my story and hopefully get feedback from people in recovery, or who have been through similar periods in their lives. I’m gonna try my best not to censor anything at all because I want to keep it real with you. \\n\\nIdk where to begin lately, life has been crazy, so I’ll just start from the beginning. \\n\\nI’m 29 now and have had an ED since I was 8. I started out with bulimia and binge eating, but by the time I was in high school I had stopped throwing up because I was so afraid/ashamed of getting caught. By the time I was 12, I was 112 lbs and 5’8”/173 cm, almost a foot taller than most of my peers. This accelerated the binging, along with my very much older siblings (m+8, f+12) who were very abusive and always calling me fat. Also, my family comes from a southern European (Mediterranean) country, so they are feeders. They can put on a second helping on your plate (unasked for) and still call you fat seconds later. Additionally, they’d always guilt me for not finishing my food, because my grandparents were refugees and worked so hard to give our family a good life. 🙄\\n\\nI think by the time I graduated high school I was close to 245. When I went to college, around 2012, I lost about 60 lbs over 3 years (so 2012-2015) due to being broke and, well, doing a lot of drugs, mostly molly and yak. It did boost my confidence a lot, and I looked really hot, but it didn’t change anything. I never learned discipline, understood myself, or learned to manage my emotions. I still binged for comfort back then. \\n\\nIn 2015 I started dating this guy (this will be relevant later) and then 6 months later my dad died, and I sank into the worst, most excruciating depression of my life. I flunked out of college. I basically didn’t leave the house for 3 years and gained 80 lbs. I still worked, albeit under the table on pot farms, so I made good money, but other than going there or the grocery store, that was it. I became seriously anxious and agoraphobic, as well as the most insecure I’ve ever been in my life. I would avoid mirrors, avoid old friends for fear of what they’d think when they saw me. Going to the grocery store or to work took me hours of getting ready prep, picking my outfits and doing my makeup so I looked perfect. Even then I still felt like people were disgusted by my appearance. \\n\\nIn about 2018, I had one of those dark nights of the soul, sat on my bed and cried about my life, what I had done to myself, and mourned the old, fucked up but undeniably happier me. I had always been depressed, anxious, occasionally suicidal, insecure, et c, but it hadn’t ever crippled my life, it was just the undercurrent. But by this point I was fully undertow. I decided that I didn’t want my life to continue this way, I had too much potential, and my father’s death really put in to perspective for me just how fragile, cruel and short life is. So I went for it. \\n\\nI researched nutrition, exercise, fasting, started doing yoga regularly to build up my strength and confidence, and it worked. Soon enough, I had a full workout routine, complete with HIIT, weightlifting, pilates and hiking. I built a home gym for myself, cause I was still too insecure to workout in public. I was eating about 1000 calories a day doing omad, with occasional multi day fasts, with 60% protein. My diet was basically, pan seared chicken, a salad, a single Brazil nut, some omega 3 and multi vitamin supplements. As well as an entire bag of Sprouts offbrand Cheetos lol. That was my daily reward. On Saturdays and Sundays I let myself eat anything and everything I wanted, and, again, it worked. Genuinely I was feeling great, and that much protein (supplemented with powders) had me feeling amazing. I wish I had the discipline to go back to that. But in reality I was just obsessed with my calorie counting, eating “clean” and workouts. But, to be fair, I did love my workouts. I felt strong for the first time in my life, even though I grew up doing multiple sports at once *and* dancing, I finally felt at home in my body. \\n\\nBy January of 2020 I was down 50 lbs, and my physique was better than ever, along with my confidence in myself and my abilities. If I could pull myself out of this dark place, what else couldn’t I do? I was finally ready to start dressing myself and feeling excited again, instead of dreading a stranger’s judgemental (in my head) eyes. \\n\\nI was still with the boyfriend I had started dating in 2015, and we were planning our wedding in my home country for the summer of 2020. He was a European immigrant and I’m a 1st gen American (with very few relatives in the states) so it made more sense to have it overseas, that way both of our families could attend. \\n\\nOf course, you can guess what happened next. \\n\\nCovid hit, and suddenly everything stopped. Everyone quarantined, and stopped talking to or interacting with strangers. Which, lol, was what I had been psyching myself up to do trying to “recover” for the last 2 years. Just my luck, right when I’m ready to leave the house again, not agoraphobic any more, no one can leave the house! I cursed myself again for taking life for granted, even though just 3 years earlier I had one of the biggest lessons in this one can learn. \\n\\nSo, anyway. Back to March 2020. \\n\\nWith all the quarantines and travel restrictions, our wedding was cancelled. I heaved a big sigh of relief, and caught myself off guard. WTF? I’ve been with this man for 5 years, he’s handsome, I love him, etc, why am I feeling relieved?? So, I did some shrooms about it. Lol. \\n\\nAt one point in my trip I looked over at him (he was also tripping) and consciously understood that I felt relief because I did not want to marry him. I felt awful, but things were clear. I spent the next week wrestling with my feelings, and what to do. At the end of the week I talked to him about how I felt, and we broke up. He moved out and was off the lease within 5 days. \\n\\nI was terrified, because I couldn’t afford the rent by myself, and our lease wasn’t gonna be up for a few more (4) months. Aaaaaand we had already re-signed it. I was financially fucked, but whatever, I’m free now to pursuemy life! What a fucking thing to feel. I dealt with a lot of guilt after that, but I never wanted him back. I just knew he wasn’t the right partner for me in the long run. \\n\\nOf course, it didn’t end there. He harassed me for weeks after he moved out, calling me a slut, saying that I used him for money (lol meanwhile I broke up with him knowing I’d have to pay our whole rent on my meager earnings by myself?! If I was gold digging I would’ve stayed with him, he was an architect and made great money.) Ultimately I had ended it because I felt like I was too young to get married, and staying with him would keep me complacent! I wanted to be independent, go back to school and have the career I always dreamed of, not be a bored, barefoot and pregnant housewife. Sure, I could’ve done those things with him, but I didn’t want to stay with him any more, and I wanted to light the proverbial fire under my ass. \\n\\nI started dating again that summer (2020), and met my worst nightmare in the shape of a handsome, generous and caring man. \\n\\nEveryone, if someone is too good to be true, they are. Run. Don’t walk. Gender and orientation don’t matter. Abusers come in all shapes and forms, from any part of the world. And they’re all smarter than you’d expect. Trust. Your. Gut. \\n\\nEverything was great at first (lovebombing). Then the crack began to show. We weren’t official yet but he was wayyyyy, way too emotionally involved with his ex girlfriend. Then, yeah, the gaslighting began. Soon, I didn’t know up from down, left from right, right from wrong. He had been slowly, like boiling a frog, been pushing back on my boundaries until I had nothing left, was stressed and anxious all the time and completely didn’t trust myself. Honestly, I was a wreck. “But I love him so much!” I’d tell myself, “Just be a little more patient, he loves you so much”. By this time we had broken up (ofc with me always initiating) and gotten back together tens of times. Eventually, he let go of his ex, who he had been triangulating me with, and we were official. Then, the abuse really ramped up. Promises of marriage started coming. He kept me hooked. \\n\\nI started a new career in aquatics, as a lifeguard and a swim instructor. Things I had always wanted to do but hadn’t had the body confidence before to jump in to. I started school again, but this time I went for a harder degree (which I am still pursuing), one that I was always too afraid of failing in to study. \\n\\nEventually, his abuse progressed from just slights about my body and my work ethic to actual physical violence. This whole time, my ex was still harassing me, and my new bf was just telling me “oh, he’s just hurting, you should just talk to him” which really hurt to hear and I ignored as much as I could. Of course, he was wrong. \\n\\nOne day I get a call from my friend who was staying with me that my ex-fiancé was coming by and leaving flowers. I was working in the next town over and staying at the abusive asshole’s place, so I wasn’t around that week. He came by multiple times leaving flowers and the most unhinged “love” letters I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It went on for days, so I stayed away. Then, a few days later, I get a call from my friend, saying the ex had climbed on to my balcony and started trying to break in. Luckily, my friend was a big dude, former marine, so he chased him off after a verbal altercation. \\n\\nWhen I got home that evening, I called the cops. \\n\\nThey arrested him, and charged him with stalking and harassment. Turns out had waited for me over night after leaving flowers and more letters, then the next morning tried to break in to my house, the morning my friend chased him off. \\n\\nI felt bad as fuck for him, even through body shakes and tears, because i once loved him. So I asked the DA to defer his sentence. Which meant that he was convicted, but his sentence wouldn’t go through unless he broke the terms of the protection order, or missed a parole meeting, or missed a domestic violence/anger management class. I thought it was all over with and I had acted with grace. \\n\\nThis whole time, my current shitty bf was telling me I was being harsh, he was just hurting, etc. I should’ve known then he was just EMPATHIZING with the guy because eventually he was going to try the same shit with me. He understood him, because he didn’t respect other people, mostly women, and didn’t understand or care about boundaries. \\n\\n3 months after his sentencing, in may of 2021, I get more flowers and letters. So his felonies went through, and even now I am again embroiled in the court process. I have nightmares about him finding me. I am going through domestic violence specific trauma therapy for this. \\n\\nEventually I free myself from my shithead boyfriend. He comes up a lot in my therapy sessions, which I got for free through a local women’s shelter. Bless their fucking hearts, doing god’s work. \\n\\nSo through all this, starting a new “career”, going back to school, dealing with 2 abusers, of course (how many times have I said this now?!) I gain back all the weight from my stress, over the 2 years since I broke up with my ex-fiancé (now stalker). About 60 lbs. \\n\\n\\nSo we’re at the present day now. I am more confident in my body than ever, even though I’m only about 10 lbs away from my starting weight. I make decent money for being in school full time, but things are tight. I like myself more than ever, but I’m 29, still working on my undergrad degree while all my peers are well in to their careers and long term relationships, or married. Idk, I am happy with my progress, but I can’t compare myself to anything or it steals my joy. \\n\\nI just want to loose the weight again, but this time healthily, and for good. And I want to ACTUALLY recover this time! But I don’t know how. I can’t stand the thought of counting calories or fasting again. I still workout about 5x a week (it’s easy, I work the front desk and teach swim lessons at the gym across the street from my house), so I kinda live at the gym. I’m strong as fuck, so my body composition is different this time starting again, so my entire mindset is different. Even though I’m the same weight again, I feel more love for myself than ever, and my body is shaped differently. \\n\\nI just can’t stop binging. The only way I have gotten in to a deficit is when I’m literally too busy to eat. \\n\\nThe fact is, I need to regain my self respect, lower my stress and anxiety, and develop a healthy relationship with food instead of treating it as a coping mechanism. I need to better learn how to manage my emotions, regulate them, and be kind to myself. \\n\\nI have some ideas of how to do this, but only when it comes to general self care, not with food. I feel like I have a food addiction, and it’s so hard to just eat what’s good, what I need, what my body needs. It’s always an emotional battle for me, and I rarely win it. \\n\\nHonestly I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m still regaining my sense of self after dumping my covert narcissistic abuser bf, still relearning to trust my gut, still trying to forgive myself for falling in to that pit of despair after my dad died, still trying to not be afraid of going outside knowing I have an active stalker… god. \\n\\nI keep trying to believe in myself and the future I’m trying to carve out for myself, but I can’t picture it within this body. \\n\\nIt’s dumb too because I’m dating some gorgeous, lean dude right now, so I guess all those insecurities I had to begin with don’t matter? I am worthy? Even at this weight? But I am so sick of tying my self worth to my looks. “Pretty isn’t the price you have to pay to exist in this world” and all, but god, I don’t know how to take it to heart. \\n\\nI have great, great friends, decent jobs, go on nice dates with frankly cool or sexy outfits that I slay in, travel, have fun, etc WHATEVER. but when I’m home? I can’t stop eating. I don’t even remember what being satisfied with a meal is like anymore. I buy healthy food but I feel like I’m starving, even though I am still gaining weight. I sit in bed at night absolutely sick with anxiety because I hate myself so much. Even though things are so much better than before! \\n\\nI just need…. Something. Some inspiration, some perspective, someone to tell me that I can power through and figure it out. I don’t wanna visit my home country again this summer and show up fat again. I know it sounds petty but I will spend most of my time there on the beach with my family, and I don’t want to hear their comments or just feel ugly asf in a swimsuit. Which I already do a few times a week teaching swim lessons, but my kids love me and never make comments about my body so I only feel it between walking to the pool from the locker room and back. \\n\\nSo how do I do it? How do I lose weight and recover at the same time?</td>\n",

heavy exercise/dieting/basically the thick of the disorder, and it’s just led me to reflect on my life when i *wasnt* disordered, and the way i was treated then. now that i am thinner, cleaned up and more conventionally attractive, all of my close friends are always reminding me to eat, take rest days, etc. they have no idea how i’d be living if i went back to being overweight and ungroomed. in fact, if this was the case, i doubt they would even be my friends at all.\\n\\ni was a fat but happy kid. my parents/grandparents/etc told me that it was baby fat and would drop off, so i lived my life without thinking about the impact on my future life and the way i would be treated. i just cant believe i used to be perfectly content munching away at nutella-filled crepes. i cant believe no one stopped me. if i could reach back into the future and yell at my younger self for one thing, it would be this. get outside, go run, put down the snacks. \\n\\ni was perfectly comfortable in my skin then. i liked taking photos, both silly and serious. i liked trying on clothes. i liked going out with my friends. i didnt realize until a few years later how bad it had gotten, and how i was, all along, being used as the “ugly fat friend.” i was the one that was there to make everyone else feel better if they didnt do their makeup to the nines or were having a bad hair day. i imagine they were saying all along, “god i hope sigh7778 is coming, i’ll never be the ugliest one around if she’s there”--and NO i am not delusional, people have literally said similar to my face. i realized all this in the way of small but snarky comments that increased as we grew up and kids learned to get meaner and meaner. and since then i have NEVER felt fully comfortable in my own body. i have never posed for a photo, i avoid fitting rooms like they have a plague waiting to be unleashed, and i am always counting down the minutes until i get home from an outing. i have not been able to enjoy life.\\n\\nback to when i was a kid. i will never forget taking “am i fat” quizzes online and trying to convince myself that i wasnt. i will never forget facing the ugly reality (literally) when my girl friends in school made fun of me to my face, knowing i wouldnt retaliate because it was just too ridiculous to even imagine--they were pretty, thin girls with the latest, trendiest clothes and i was *not*, i had no leg to stand on in that argument--and the boys either acted like i didnt exist or like i was human filth, or even less than human. i will never forget crying curled up on an exercise mat because i felt like a fat pig for being unable to do a crunch, thinking that i would never be able to change. in a way, i was right. i will never forget that, when my parents got divorced, they each blamed *each other* for letting me get so fat (yeah no shit).\\n\\nTHAT was the beginning of the loss of my childhood innocence and happiness. realizing how much of the world revolved around how attractive the people within it were. i was smart, funny and well-read--i was a great writer and signed up for contests. but no one cared about my “inner beauty,” even when they pretended to--it’s easy to say that when you’re attractive, because you will automatically be adored despite your flaws. in fact, i notice now that certain flaws will even be embraced as a result of attractiveness. case in point: “high school mean girl” archetypes and rude, jockish guys grew up the most successful people i know, and they are now shaping our society. people with the most horribly abrasive personalities get off scot free if they are beautiful, simply because everyone wants their attention, even if it is negative--while an ugly person behaving the same way would quite literally get the shit beat out of them. who doesnt love living in a world like this.\\n\\nmy own life is proof. people’s first impressions of me were always--awkward, weird, nerdy, etc. meanwhile girls with my exact mannerisms, who were cute and dressed well, were treated like gods in the flesh. i will never forget the disparity between how even authority figures like teachers--who were supposed to be well versed in avoiding bias--treated me vs my more attractive classmates. a female teacher once called another student “the perfect trinity of a woman” (beautiful, smart, kind) or something of those lines. im sorry but the girl in question had no distinguishing traits--that is to say if she was ugly/fat she would be invisible--and still people worshipped the ground she walked on because she was extremely thin and had a full face of makeup on everyday. good for her, but i will always resent that canyon of distance between the way beautiful vs ugly people are treated, even if they have identical personalities, or if the uglier one is actually more pleasant to be around. aside from my own lived experiences, i have witnessed so many average or below average people lose out on opportunities in favour of more attractive counterparts, and no matter how much “everyone is beautiful” shit i am told, i just cant forget everything that i saw and heard in my life until now.\\n\\nnow i am thinner. i fixed my hair and wear it in a way that suits me. i am still not at my goal weight but i have a “natural hourglass” (ugh) with bigger boobs and hips so i get enough romantic attention--this makes me feel sick in of itself, and i still hate the way i look personally, but thats a different topic. what i hate the most--the difference in how i am treated is ASTRONOMICAL. \\n\\nfor the first time in my life people are openly jealous of me. i have now witnessed the “crabs in a bucket” behaviour, even from close friends and family. when i was ugly, me being smart or well spoken was not nearly as much of a threat because i’m sure everyone thought “she’s not getting anywhere with looks like that.” i am still the exact same person i was, but now i seem to incite anger/competitive behaviour because i am not only talented and educated but also attractive. that is it. that is the only difference. before i was considered unworthy of success because i was ugly and fat, and now i am in reach of it, and other people just seem to have a reflex to tear that down. i’ve never seen anything like it before in my life. \\n\\nas for people i dont know, they are WAY kinder to me. men especially seem to think i am way more interesting than i ever was as a fat ugly girl, much to absolutely no one’s surprise. i still talk about the same things, i have the same hobbies, i play the same sports and i listen to the same music--still i am now someone that others want to be friends with or have a chat with. the same “others” that treated me like an animal or a human pet when i was unattractive.\\n\\ni truly believe that, in my heart, i will never be able to trust anyone again. hearing my own parents admit, after years of enabling me and giving me the unhealthiest shit to eat, that i really was fat and undisciplined and disgusting in their eyes--people who were supposed to love me and look out for me. having people who looked down on me try to worm their way into my life. having people who turned me down now hit on me. having people open doors for me, hand me free shit and help me when i dont even look like i need it. I KNOW for a fact that i would not be having all of these benefits if i was still ugly, and it makes me hate everyone, even those that are perfectly kind. \\n\\ni am terrified of showing my \"true self\" to anyone, because for so long my genuine self was treated like filth. only now that i am attractive, everyone suddenly recognizes this “new version” of me as someone worthy of respect and envy--the exact same person as before, just slimmer and done up. and i will never be able to forget that. i havent changed at all aside from my looks, but people act like i was literally blessed by god in front of them. i could be openly rude now and get away with it, not that i ever would want to. i could get away with so much that my ugly self wouldve been instantly crucified for. it’s just the truth.\\n\\nno matter how interesting you are, no matter how funny, no matter how intelligent, curious or kind, you will never be treated as a real, total human being if you are ugly. you will NEVER be afforded the same opportunities or good treatment that beautiful people are. knowing this, living it, how can i NOT be disordered? how can i not want to starve/diet/work out way more than my body can take? i’ve only just stepped into the world of these advantages that other people have been enjoying basically since birth, and i just dont feel guilty or wrong for wanting to stay in it. \\n\\nthe world inherently encourages us to change. the same people telling us all along that we are perfect as we are, treating us like shit. lol</td>\n",

       "      <td>This time last year I was enveloped in an ED. I was working, but not mentally present. All I had energy for was laying in bed on my phone. I cut myself off my loved ones. I gave up my hobbies. I quit university. Of course there were the physical health issues too. Eventually I became so depressed that the only reason I had for not killing myself was because I wasn't skinny enough yet. \\n\\nFollowing an inpatient stay, a hospital stay, some gained trauma, some panic attacks, health issues, suicidal ideations, a handful of complete nervous breakdowns, gallons of chocolate flavored liquefied ass (If any of y'all have been IP, you know what I mean), months of depression and anxiety, a relapse, some more months of depression and anxiety...\\n\\nI stand (or type heh) before you as someone who beat anorexia. I'm now in university again, working, learning a new language, doing yoga, and gradually learning to love myself. And I sincerely enjoy eating again. Yeah, I'm still learning the ropes around intuitive eating, and yeah, there is still that fear in the back of my head that I'll gain weight if I eat normally, but I know how to combat that now, and that fear gets quieter every day.\\n\\nMy biggest fear is that my mental illnesses will return. But the good news is that even if they do, I feel so much more capable of handling them. I look back on where I was last year and think, \"Wow, I really am one tenacious motherfucker.\"\\n\\nI'm not trying to flaunt my successes. I just wanted to let you know that it does get better and recovery is 100% possible for you. Life goes on, and it is so much more beautiful without an ED in it. I am a living example of that. I thought I'd include some tips that got me to where I am today too, hopefully they'll help someone. \\n\\n1) Laugh through the pain.\\n\\nHumor is a great coping skill. There's humor even in the horrible stuff, and trust me, finding the humor in the tough stuff will make it easier to handle by taking away some of its power in your head. Example: If you don't know this already: you get hella constipated in recovery. Like, HELLA. Your body has no idea what to do with food cuz it's a chump and forgot. In treatment, if you don't shit within a few days they give you mag citrate. And if that doesn't work, an enema. And then you wait. There are two brown liquids in recovery. One is gross, chocolate, high-calorie protein drinks. You can guess what the other is. There were a lot of times everyone would be at dinner or chilling and someone would suddenly be like \"I GOTTA GO OH FUCK\" and book their ass over to the bathroom. On the one hand, super embarrassing. On the other, it was hilarious because pretty much everyone went through it. Shit was common talk among my recovery friends. Moral of the story: There is humor in almost everything, friends. Lean into it to cope.\\n\\n2) Rely on your support system.\\n\\nOne of the stupidest parts about eating disorders is how unavailable treatment is for a lot of people. Treatment is expensive, and your insurance won't always cover it--if you can even afford insurance at all. I was incredibly lucky to be able to get so much help. But if you can't, you're gonna need people. I had to build up my relationships with my loved ones when I decided to recover. And I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have them. It can be hard for people to understand the hell that is an eating disorder, but if they're good friends or family members then they'll try to understand. If you truly feel like you don't have anyone in your life you can rely on, then step one is to start seeking out those relationships however you can. Step two is get on the Internet while you're crafting those relationships. Reddit is full of understanding humans who have great advice and can offer support. Be open to letting people help.\\n\\n3) If all you can do is exist for a while, that's okay.\\n\\nNot gonna lie, it really was all I could do to exist for a hot minute there. Every day was anixety-inducing and overwhelming and depressing. So I stopped trying so hard and did the bare minimum until I had a little more energy to do just a little more, and I built up from there. Yeah, it's important to push yourself, but when you're trying to recover from an eating disorder or depression, it's okay to just focus on eating, sleeping, and shitting for a while. Not forever, but for a while. You don't have to do it all today.\\n\\n4) Accept that you're a tenacious motherfucker whether you like it or not.\\n\\nDetemined! Persistent! Never gives up! Refuses to be destroyed! All of the above mean tenacious. And wow, are humans tenacious. We're incredibly adaptable, living in almost every type of environment throughout history. If you embrace this part of your literal DNA, you'll start realizing you can adapt to more than you think. Including the life you want that no longer features an ED.\\n\\n5) Delete your public social media.\\n\\nStop messing around. There is so much freaking research about how social media has a negative effect on mental health. Bruh. It ain't worth it. For me personally, I have an anonymous IG that I use *only* to follow positive self-help accounts and to communicate with my bff because she doesn't have a cell phone right now. Maybe one day I'll start using it again, but sure as hell not when my pain around comparison and shame is so fresh. If you're seriously trying to recover, social media is only going to make it harder. (Side note: Reddit doesn't count in my book, because almost all of it is anonymous.) \\n\\n6) Swear a lot.\\n\\nIt's so fucking cathartic, man. Swear at diet culture. (Kiss my ass, Chloe Ting Challenges.\" (Mind you, not Chloe Ting herself, she seems like a wonderful person. But her videos aren't for you, bruh.)) Cuss out the plate before you. (\"You think you're tough, bitch? You're nothing but a dick-sucking ham sandwich.\") Cuss at your therapist even. (\"The fuck? Why would I ever even consider family therapy?\") You are entitled to be angry about your situation. ED recovery sucks, and you didn't ask for this. Swearing releases the tension, at least for me. And it makes me laugh lol.\\n\\n7) Don't pretend 'it never happened.'\\n\\nThis is for later on in recovery, but something I tried doing after I was more confident in my abilities was being like, \"Eating disorder? What's an eating disorder? Never heard of her\" for a while. It didn't work. You can't erase trauma. If you pretend it didn't happen, all you are doing is setting yourself up for more triggering situations. Be openminded to the fact that you've been through a very hard thing, and though it isn't part of your narrative now, it *was* undeniably a chapter in your life. You and I both have to make peace with that.\\n\\n8) Maybe there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe *you're* the light. \\n\\nThis isn't really a tip, but it's a comment I saw somewhere (I don't recall the username, otherwise I'd give them credit) that really slapped me once across the cheek then again on the other. Full disclosure: I don't fully respect myself. I don't fully love myself. (But I don't HATE myself anymore. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm like, \"damn who is she\" and other times, even in the same day, I'll be like, \"who is that nasty-ass upright ape.\" I digress.) You are the light. No one is going to save you but yourself. Even if you can't see it right now, you're glowing, bitch.\\n\\n9) Realize nothing is permanent. \\n\\nIt's the tacky quote hanging above your aunt's toilet. And I love it. If I've learned anything through my *cough* several mental-illness-related breakdowns, it's that emotions don't last forever. And more than that, life itself doesn't last forever. I know this isn't a thought that's comforting when you're in the beginning of recovery, but later on you'll be like, \"Why the hell would I diET and never let myself eat sushi when I have less than 100 years to live and I freaking love sushi? I'll take the goddamn rainbow roll, sir.\" But if you're still in the thick of it, just keep reminding yourself that you're a tenacious motherfucker who lives in a world where things like cats and airplanes and Avatar: The Last Airbender and young Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic exist, and one day those things might be more important to you than an ED if you keep going.\\n\\nJust some things that have helped me. Thanks for reading. Today I am deleting this sub from my favorited list, because I find I no longer need to come here. Thank you for all of the help, advice, support, answers, and compassion I've found in this little sub.\\n\\nIt's a beautiful day, isn't it? See ya around :)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I’ve had “ anorexia” since I was around 11 years old, and ARFID for as long as I remember (I guess the anorexia would be ARFID+, but I’m not a fan of that label and see it as two separate issues for me. My ARFID feels too separate from my anorexia and vice versa.) The anorexia started at 11 for not body image issues but to gain some control over my life because of trauma, mental health in general, intrusive thoughts, etc. when that was no longer enough to fuel it, it switched to the typical anorexia featuring body image issues, probably partially because I found the ED community online and my self esteem was always wrecked. It turned into this fully. \\n\\nI ended up in a weird place with my family, who would force feed me without getting me treatment and being on my back about it. Eventually, I decided to recover for myself, and had a bit of a struggle phase with that but eventually achieved in my opinion full recovery. And I was happy, so truly happy for awhile. I thought even the most impossible things to cure were cured, like the depression. \\n\\nThen a global pandemic happened. This reset a lot of things for me, but my eating disorder wasn’t affected yet, but there was cracks starting to appear subconsciously because I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and found my weight starting to tiptoe into the overweight category. I still didn’t focus too hard on it right away. After all bmi charts aren’t everything. But it kept going like this, and I didn’t even eat much just started to eat normal even though I still had ARFID. I made some strides with ARFID too but I will admit that never left, but at the time I didn’t even know that was disorderly at all. \\n\\nMy weight kept creeping up and it was at a point where I couldn’t ignore it bugging me. I made an edtwt account to just be a bit snarky on about it without really relapsing, but not wanting people to bug me about how unhealthy it was or freak out at me for relapsing, although this is probably a start for relapsing. The account was deactivated because people discovered it was mine which lead to a lot of drama / shame. \\n\\nLeading up to this I knew I’d be moving onto my college campus soon. I was worried this would make me relapse, as I know me being fully in charge of taking care of myself is a… recipe for disaster? Especially because I’d have to walk OUTSIDE for it and stuff so there’s no more convenience? When I moved in though I was good, but the food was kinda bad for my ARFID issues, and I found myself in a tug of war with going to the dining hall or not. Eventually that started to slip, and I also found myself focusing on the ED community again. I relapsed on my anorexia but I was in denial about it because I had a day where I’d eat a normal big meal, with my uncle, at my favorite restaurant, and that I wasn’t “intentionally doing it.” But that didn’t make me living off of vending machine nuts or small bags of chips any better. And I really started hating on my body and anxious about how others perceived it. \\n\\nIn December I went a whole week off little bags of nuts from the vending machine and that’s it until I started feeling really weird symptoms like internal shaking but not outside shaking, the weirdest emotions, uncontrollable tears, dizziness, and weird feelings in my heart. I forced myself to eat at the dining hall after all day of feeling those symptoms. Later that week there was judgements for resident hall Christmas decorations and we were all asked to come and we’d get cookies which I came for originally, but found myself unbearingly overwhelmed about my body size and being seen by others in the hall and left without cookies. \\n\\nNow more recently on break I’ve been having full on ED thoughts. I’ve been doing everything that triggers me: wintergirls, thinspo, bonespo, edtwt, looking at post photos of myself, weighing myself, planning on being a better anorexic, etc. I’ve been fantasizing about going back after break is over (I can’t really be a “good” anorexic here. I have to eat normal here) will be. I’ve been thinking about how great it would be to keep living off nuts but also going to the campus gym more because I’m already paying for it anyway, what the thin version of myself would be, about how I need to do this because my hypothyroid made me blow up so much in weight, etc. it doesn’t help I got sent very triggering comments from abusers basically telling me unprompted that I let myself go and that I am not anorexic nor ever was anorexic and all this shit, calling me fat, ugly, undesirable… basically any meanspo type comment ever that’s made worse by the unsolicited nature of it all. I want to be a “good anorexic” again to prove them wrong, and make everyone worried about me again, all while I would achieve what a “good anorexic” is about with a new ultimate goal weight and everything. \\n\\nBut… is that what I want? I don’t want to fuck up my GPA. I don’t want to have health issues. I don’t want to feel as shitty as I did when I know I was in the thick of it because I was hallucinating then from the lack of nutrients. I got sent a beautiful message the other day from someone I met from edtwt who went to recovery not long after I met them about how I should recover too and totally do it and how I should do it because I want to be able to have babies and I deserve recovery which made me cry because it was all true and validated my feelings. So I want recovery.\\n\\nBut is that what I want either? No. My mind is being very toxic right now about how I need to do this for at least a little while because of my BMI and what hypothyroidism done to me and that nows my opportunity to be able to feel that euphoria from restricting again which I have truly missed. And feel like I need because so much is going wrong for me right now and it all falls back into control issues deep down and I just miss being sick again and the things I romanticized about it all.\\n\\nMy mind is so toxic. I’m here crying because I don’t know what I want and I don’t know if I care enough to want better anymore and feel so guilty about how I threw that recovery era all away but I now also loathe that era more than anything. I don’t know. \\n\\nI don’t want help either.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n\\nSo my church has a weekly potluck lunch and for awhile I’d just avoid eating much because it’s hard to feel safe, even when I track, if it’s other people’s food. But then brilliant me had an idea.\\n\\nMy ED is a small part influenced by guilt about money and spending it on food on me specifically. So I decided, heck, this is free food, I’ll OMAD it and that’ll be that. Then I upped my limit for that OMAD, from &amp;gt;!up to 800!&amp;lt; to &amp;gt;!1200.!&amp;lt; Basically allowing myself to “binge” once a week with some decreased guilt on all levels. \\n\\nBut here’s where the fuckup begins. Last time, or some time recently, I ended up triggering an actual binge that lasted a few days because of this OMAD where I kept going back into the kitchen for more pieces of everything, no shame whatsoever. Ok maybe a little but my feral, food-obsessed brain was stronger, for once, than my social anxiety. \\n\\nAnyway, I’ve been back to mid/high res which is my usual goal, and then this week I’m not really even that hungry coming into the lunch. It’s smaller, too, not as many people, so not as many different options. And it’s spaghetti etc which is high cal in SUCH low amounts, which is, obviously, quite scary. \\n\\nI didn’t even need to try to skip breakfast (helped that I slept in) and I wasn’t thinking I even wanted much so I got a small plate. Not by ED standards but by general standards it was small. \\n\\nI can’t remember when the shift happened, but I unlocked this binge urge, though I resisted throughout the times I gave in too. Meaning, I had a second piece of garlic bread but not a fourth. (Wow, such willpower.) \\n\\nAnd then I end up grabbing a bowl of veggies (which I ate a decent amount of anyway because cherry tomatoes can GET IT and it was the best celery I’d ever tasted for some reason) and walking around with it in an attempt to satisfy the binge urges by volume eating. I’d already eaten what was basically maintenance so I was trying to ease out of a mindset where I’d keep eating. \\n\\nSo I go and do some random games with some friends and I lose the urge to keep shoveling bread in my mouth like a starved Victorian orphan. \\n\\nBut of course, it doesn’t end here, because I’m still at maintenance and the universe apparently wishes me ill. \\n\\nSomeone decides it’ll be a great idea to get ice cream. And I make some excuses about allergies but it doesn’t work and I eat an ice cream cone. Not gonna lie, it was amazing. I haven’t had one in a while just because it’s winter as well as for obvious reasons. And I enjoyed it. I refused to let myself NOT enjoy it, because I was basically forced to eat it. (Not really but I can’t walk over and throw away an ice cream cone in front of the person who gave it to me. And no matter what YOU would do, I’M not going to shove it in my pocket :) 😉)\\n\\nSo it was a good cone. And it was a bad occurrence. Because it re-aroused the binge beast and I had to get another bowl of lettuce to avoid tipping the table into my mouth. \\n\\nFortunately when I left the room again and then came back with a bit of binge intentions, the food had already been cleaned up. \\n\\nBut now I get in the car with my family and my parents are starving because they didn’t eat much. So we go get some snacks at the store and I get given a portion, which, again, I have no convenient hidey-hole in which to shove. \\n\\nSo I end up at &amp;gt;!2,000!&amp;lt; which I’m like, fuck. But ok, I did a lot of exercise playing games so I’m probably ok just for today. And I think I’m done and I should be satisfied, RIGHT??\\n\\nBut then I feel the need to eat, not 1, not 2, nor yet again 3. Not even 4, but FIVE protein bars which are NOT low calorie. I’m running around doing chores literally ravenous and stifling moans of hunger while I shove these protein bars in my mouth. \\n\\nThen I think I’m done. I did a few reps of weights so I can feel like I’m gaining something good from this insane saga. Hey, if I’m going to eat &amp;gt;!3,500!&amp;lt; might as well get them gains, right? :,)\\n\\nExercise can generally turn off some of my binge urges so I think I’m good.\\n\\nThen, I have no recollection how, I decided to eat just o\\^n\\^e more thing. Maybe it was because I still have this weird belief I have to eat the protein after I workout or else it won’t work. That’s not true, right? 🤨\\n\\nTo make a very long story shorter, I ended up spooning sunflower butter, after carefully measuring and then just saying, screw it im eating from the jar, as the fam walks into the room. So we leave to go somewhere else and for 15 minutes after we leave I’m thinking about this food and I’m wishing I had brought it. Then I lose the urge to eat and I’m grateful I didn’t bring it. \\n\\nThen we come home and I’m stupid so I eat a little bit of what I don’t necessarily feel a huge urge to eat but I do feel somewhat hungry and everyone else is having snacks so I have one too. \\n\\nI have to mention, at this point my stomach is quite full, kind of hard from all the food packed in it, but I’m still HUNGRY. I’m freaking ravenous. That was how I felt the entire day when I felt this insane urge to eat and eat and eat. \\n\\nAnyway, I eat snacks with my siblings, and I end the day at a glorious &amp;gt;!4,300!&amp;lt; cals. Dude. \\n\\nThe thing is, I know that todays weight isn’t real, just food weight, but I also know that this brought my week’s average almost up to a point where it doesn’t even out to me restricting at all. \\n\\nBut I still can’t feel that much guilt or panic, which in a sense is good, but so, so odd. \\n\\nNot sure if I’ve started a binge/restrict cycle, so pretty scared of that, but I haven’t yet decided what to do about today. Should I ease down by eating maintenance and lowering, or should I go back to normal mid-high res? I guess I’ll see what happens. I’m still full from yesterday and I have to focus on ✨life✨ what a glorious concept. Other things are boring but my ed always have something interesting to throw at me 🤪😭\\n\\nIdk why I took the time to write this but hopefully it isn't completely illegible and boring.

I lost the weight by starving myself and over exercising daily. I had a seizure in March 2022, became bedbound and binged daily for comfort. I have such an unhealthy relationship with food. I’m at 225lbs now, and don’t want to gain more. But I don’t want to starve myself and set myself up for failure. I don’t even care if I loose I just don’t want to keep gaining.

       "8890   Hi guys. This is kinda a diary post, but I want to share my story and hopefully get feedback from people in recovery, or who have been through similar periods in their lives. I’m gonna try my best not to censor anything at all because I want to keep it real with you. \\n\\nIdk where to begin lately, life has been crazy, so I’ll just start from the beginning. \\n\\nI’m 29 now and have had an ED since I was 8. I started out with bulimia and binge eating, but by the time I was in high school I had stopped throwing up because I was so afraid/ashamed of getting caught. By the time I was 12, I was 112 lbs and 5’8”/173 cm, almost a foot taller than most of my peers. This accelerated the binging, along with my very much older siblings (m+8, f+12) who were very abusive and always calling me fat. Also, my family comes from a southern European (Mediterranean) country, so they are feeders. They can put on a second helping on your plate (unasked for) and still call you fat seconds later. Additionally, they’d always guilt me for not finishing my food, because my grandparents were refugees and worked so hard to give our family a good life. 🙄\\n\\nI think by the time I graduated high school I was close to 245. When I went to college, around 2012, I lost about 60 lbs over 3 years (so 2012-2015) due to being broke and, well, doing a lot of drugs, mostly molly and yak. It did boost my confidence a lot, and I looked really hot, but it didn’t change anything. I never learned discipline, understood myself, or learned to manage my emotions. I still binged for comfort back then. \\n\\nIn 2015 I started dating this guy (this will be relevant later) and then 6 months later my dad died, and I sank into the worst, most excruciating depression of my life. I flunked out of college. I basically didn’t leave the house for 3 years and gained 80 lbs. I still worked, albeit under the table on pot farms, so I made good money, but other than going there or the grocery store, that was it. I became seriously anxious and agoraphobic, as well as the most insecure I’ve ever been in my life. I would avoid mirrors, avoid old friends for fear of what they’d think when they saw me. Going to the grocery store or to work took me hours of getting ready prep, picking my outfits and doing my makeup so I looked perfect. Even then I still felt like people were disgusted by my appearance. \\n\\nIn about 2018, I had one of those dark nights of the soul, sat on my bed and cried about my life, what I had done to myself, and mourned the old, fucked up but undeniably happier me. I had always been depressed, anxious, occasionally suicidal, insecure, et c, but it hadn’t ever crippled my life, it was just the undercurrent. But by this point I was fully undertow. I decided that I didn’t want my life to continue this way, I had too much potential, and my father’s death really put in to perspective for me just how fragile, cruel and short life is. So I went for it. \\n\\nI researched nutrition, exercise, fasting, started doing yoga regularly to build up my strength and confidence, and it worked. Soon enough, I had a full workout routine, complete with HIIT, weightlifting, pilates and hiking. I built a home gym for myself, cause I was still too insecure to workout in public. I was eating about 1000 calories a day doing omad, with occasional multi day fasts, with 60% protein. My diet was basically, pan seared chicken, a salad, a single Brazil nut, some omega 3 and multi vitamin supplements. As well as an entire bag of Sprouts offbrand Cheetos lol. That was my daily reward. On Saturdays and Sundays I let myself eat anything and everything I wanted, and, again, it worked. Genuinely I was feeling great, and that much protein (supplemented with powders) had me feeling amazing. I wish I had the discipline to go back to that. But in reality I was just obsessed with my calorie counting, eating “clean” and workouts. But, to be fair, I did love my workouts. I felt strong for the first time in my life, even though I grew up doing multiple sports at once *and* dancing, I finally felt at home in my body. \\n\\nBy January of 2020 I was down 50 lbs, and my physique was better than ever, along with my confidence in myself and my abilities. If I could pull myself out of this dark place, what else couldn’t I do? I was finally ready to start dressing myself and feeling excited again, instead of dreading a stranger’s judgemental (in my head) eyes. \\n\\nI was still with the boyfriend I had started dating in 2015, and we were planning our wedding in my home country for the summer of 2020. He was a European immigrant and I’m a 1st gen American (with very few relatives in the states) so it made more sense to have it overseas, that way both of our families could attend. \\n\\nOf course, you can guess what happened next. \\n\\nCovid hit, and suddenly everything stopped. Everyone quarantined, and stopped talking to or interacting with strangers. Which, lol, was what I had been psyching myself up to do trying to “recover” for the last 2 years. Just my luck, right when I’m ready to leave the house again, not agoraphobic any more, no one can leave the house! I cursed myself again for taking life for granted, even though just 3 years earlier I had one of the biggest lessons in this one can learn. \\n\\nSo, anyway. Back to March 2020. \\n\\nWith all the quarantines and travel restrictions, our wedding was cancelled. I heaved a big sigh of relief, and caught myself off guard. WTF? I’ve been with this man for 5 years, he’s handsome, I love him, etc, why am I feeling relieved?? So, I did some shrooms about it. Lol. \\n\\nAt one point in my trip I looked over at him (he was also tripping) and consciously understood that I felt relief because I did not want to marry him. I felt awful, but things were clear. I spent the next week wrestling with my feelings, and what to do. At the end of the week I talked to him about how I felt, and we broke up. He moved out and was off the lease within 5 days. \\n\\nI was terrified, because I couldn’t afford the rent by myself, and our lease wasn’t gonna be up for a few more (4) months. Aaaaaand we had already re-signed it. I was financially fucked, but whatever, I’m free now to pursuemy life! What a fucking thing to feel. I dealt with a lot of guilt after that, but I never wanted him back. I just knew he wasn’t the right partner for me in the long run. \\n\\nOf course, it didn’t end there. He harassed me for weeks after he moved out, calling me a slut, saying that I used him for money (lol meanwhile I broke up with him knowing I’d have to pay our whole rent on my meager earnings by myself?! If I was gold digging I would’ve stayed with him, he was an architect and made great money.) Ultimately I had ended it because I felt like I was too young to get married, and staying with him would keep me complacent! I wanted to be independent, go back to school and have the career I always dreamed of, not be a bored, barefoot and pregnant housewife. Sure, I could’ve done those things with him, but I didn’t want to stay with him any more, and I wanted to light the proverbial fire under my ass. \\n\\nI started dating again that summer (2020), and met my worst nightmare in the shape of a handsome, generous and caring man. \\n\\nEveryone, if someone is too good to be true, they are. Run. Don’t walk. Gender and orientation don’t matter. Abusers come in all shapes and forms, from any part of the world. And they’re all smarter than you’d expect. Trust. Your. Gut. \\n\\nEverything was great at first (lovebombing). Then the crack began to show. We weren’t official yet but he was wayyyyy, way too emotionally involved with his ex girlfriend. Then, yeah, the gaslighting began. Soon, I didn’t know up from down, left from right, right from wrong. He had been slowly, like boiling a frog, been pushing back on my boundaries until I had nothing left, was stressed and anxious all the time and completely didn’t trust myself. Honestly, I was a wreck. “But I love him so much!” I’d tell myself, “Just be a little more patient, he loves you so much”. By this time we had broken up (ofc with me always initiating) and gotten back together tens of times. Eventually, he let go of his ex, who he had been triangulating me with, and we were official. Then, the abuse really ramped up. Promises of marriage started coming. He kept me hooked. \\n\\nI started a new career in aquatics, as a lifeguard and a swim instructor. Things I had always wanted to do but hadn’t had the body confidence before to jump in to. I started school again, but this time I went for a harder degree (which I am still pursuing), one that I was always too afraid of failing in to study. \\n\\nEventually, his abuse progressed from just slights about my body and my work ethic to actual physical violence. This whole time, my ex was still harassing me, and my new bf was just telling me “oh, he’s just hurting, you should just talk to him” which really hurt to hear and I ignored as much as I could. Of course, he was wrong. \\n\\nOne day I get a call from my friend who was staying with me that my ex-fiancé was coming by and leaving flowers. I was working in the next town over and staying at the abusive asshole’s place, so I wasn’t around that week. He came by multiple times leaving flowers and the most unhinged “love” letters I have ever had the misfortune of reading. It went on for days, so I stayed away. Then, a few days later, I get a call from my friend, saying the ex had climbed on to my balcony and started trying to break in. Luckily, my friend was a big dude, former marine, so he chased him off after a verbal altercation. \\n\\nWhen I got home that evening, I called the cops. \\n\\nThey arrested him, and charged him with stalking and harassment. Turns out had waited for me over night after leaving flowers and more letters, then the next morning tried to break in to my house, the morning my friend chased him off. \\n\\nI felt bad as fuck for him, even through body shakes and tears, because i once loved him. So I asked the DA to defer his sentence. Which meant that he was convicted, but his sentence wouldn’t go through unless he broke the terms of the protection order, or missed a parole meeting, or missed a domestic violence/anger management class. I thought it was all over with and I had acted with grace. \\n\\nThis whole time, my current shitty bf was telling me I was being harsh, he was just hurting, etc. I should’ve known then he was just EMPATHIZING with the guy because eventually he was going to try the same shit with me. He understood him, because he didn’t respect other people, mostly women, and didn’t understand or care about boundaries. \\n\\n3 months after his sentencing, in may of 2021, I get more flowers and letters. So his felonies went through, and even now I am again embroiled in the court process. I have nightmares about him finding me. I am going through domestic violence specific trauma therapy for this. \\n\\nEventually I free myself from my shithead boyfriend. He comes up a lot in my therapy sessions, which I got for free through a local women’s shelter. Bless their fucking hearts, doing god’s work. \\n\\nSo through all this, starting a new “career”, going back to school, dealing with 2 abusers, of course (how many times have I said this now?!) I gain back all the weight from my stress, over the 2 years since I broke up with my ex-fiancé (now stalker). About 60 lbs. \\n\\n\\nSo we’re at the present day now. I am more confident in my body than ever, even though I’m only about 10 lbs away from my starting weight. I make decent money for being in school full time, but things are tight. I like myself more than ever, but I’m 29, still working on my undergrad degree while all my peers are well in to their careers and long term relationships, or married. Idk, I am happy with my progress, but I can’t compare myself to anything or it steals my joy. \\n\\nI just want to loose the weight again, but this time healthily, and for good. And I want to ACTUALLY recover this time! But I don’t know how. I can’t stand the thought of counting calories or fasting again. I still workout about 5x a week (it’s easy, I work the front desk and teach swim lessons at the gym across the street from my house), so I kinda live at the gym. I’m strong as fuck, so my body composition is different this time starting again, so my entire mindset is different. Even though I’m the same weight again, I feel more love for myself than ever, and my body is shaped differently. \\n\\nI just can’t stop binging. The only way I have gotten in to a deficit is when I’m literally too busy to eat. \\n\\nThe fact is, I need to regain my self respect, lower my stress and anxiety, and develop a healthy relationship with food instead of treating it as a coping mechanism. I need to better learn how to manage my emotions, regulate them, and be kind to myself. \\n\\nI have some ideas of how to do this, but only when it comes to general self care, not with food. I feel like I have a food addiction, and it’s so hard to just eat what’s good, what I need, what my body needs. It’s always an emotional battle for me, and I rarely win it. \\n\\nHonestly I’m at a loss for what to do. I’m still regaining my sense of self after dumping my covert narcissistic abuser bf, still relearning to trust my gut, still trying to forgive myself for falling in to that pit of despair after my dad died, still trying to not be afraid of going outside knowing I have an active stalker… god. \\n\\nI keep trying to believe in myself and the future I’m trying to carve out for myself, but I can’t picture it within this body. \\n\\nIt’s dumb too because I’m dating some gorgeous, lean dude right now, so I guess all those insecurities I had to begin with don’t matter? I am worthy? Even at this weight? But I am so sick of tying my self worth to my looks. “Pretty isn’t the price you have to pay to exist in this world” and all, but god, I don’t know how to take it to heart. \\n\\nI have great, great friends, decent jobs, go on nice dates with frankly cool or sexy outfits that I slay in, travel, have fun, etc WHATEVER. but when I’m home? I can’t stop eating. I don’t even remember what being satisfied with a meal is like anymore. I buy healthy food but I feel like I’m starving, even though I am still gaining weight. I sit in bed at night absolutely sick with anxiety because I hate myself so much. Even though things are so much better than before! \\n\\nI just need…. Something. Some inspiration, some perspective, someone to tell me that I can power through and figure it out. I don’t wanna visit my home country again this summer and show up fat again. I know it sounds petty but I will spend most of my time there on the beach with my family, and I don’t want to hear their comments or just feel ugly asf in a swimsuit. Which I already do a few times a week teaching swim lessons, but my kids love me and never make comments about my body so I only feel it between walking to the pool from the locker room and back. \\n\\nSo how do I do it? How do I lose weight and recover at the same time?   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         i posted about this in another sub. i kind of want to vent in a place where more people might understand more acutely though. i feel this is going to be very triggering so i’ll put a warning.\\n\\nlately i’m just thinking about the effect of my attractiveness on the kind of life i live, not that it hasn’t already consumed my thoughts for years--i’ve just been getting back into heavy exercise/dieting/basically the thick of the disorder, and it’s just led me to reflect on my life when i *wasnt* disordered, and the way i was treated then. now that i am thinner, cleaned up and more conventionally attractive, all of my close friends are always reminding me to eat, take rest days, etc. they have no idea how i’d be living if i went back to being overweight and ungroomed. in fact, if this was the case, i doubt they would even be my friends at all.\\n\\ni was a fat but happy kid. my parents/grandparents/etc told me that it was baby fat and would drop off, so i lived my life without thinking about the impact on my future life and the way i would be treated. i just cant believe i used to be perfectly content munching away at nutella-filled crepes. i cant believe no one stopped me. if i could reach back into the future and yell at my younger self for one thing, it would be this. get outside, go run, put down the snacks. \\n\\ni was perfectly comfortable in my skin then. i liked taking photos, both silly and serious. i liked trying on clothes. i liked going out with my friends. i didnt realize until a few years later how bad it had gotten, and how i was, all along, being used as the “ugly fat friend.” i was the one that was there to make everyone else feel better if they didnt do their makeup to the nines or were having a bad hair day. i imagine they were saying all along, “god i hope sigh7778 is coming, i’ll never be the ugliest one around if she’s there”--and NO i am not delusional, people have literally said similar to my face. i realized all this in the way of small but snarky comments that increased as we grew up and kids learned to get meaner and meaner. and since then i have NEVER felt fully comfortable in my own body. i have never posed for a photo, i avoid fitting rooms like they have a plague waiting to be unleashed, and i am always counting down the minutes until i get home from an outing. i have not been able to enjoy life.\\n\\nback to when i was a kid. i will never forget taking “am i fat” quizzes online and trying to convince myself that i wasnt. i will never forget facing the ugly reality (literally) when my girl friends in school made fun of me to my face, knowing i wouldnt retaliate because it was just too ridiculous to even imagine--they were pretty, thin girls with the latest, trendiest clothes and i was *not*, i had no leg to stand on in that argument--and the boys either acted like i didnt exist or like i was human filth, or even less than human. i will never forget crying curled up on an exercise mat because i felt like a fat pig for being unable to do a crunch, thinking that i would never be able to change. in a way, i was right. i will never forget that, when my parents got divorced, they each blamed *each other* for letting me get so fat (yeah no shit).\\n\\nTHAT was the beginning of the loss of my childhood innocence and happiness. realizing how much of the world revolved around how attractive the people within it were. i was smart, funny and well-read--i was a great writer and signed up for contests. but no one cared about my “inner beauty,” even when they pretended to--it’s easy to say that when you’re attractive, because you will automatically be adored despite your flaws. in fact, i notice now that certain flaws will even be embraced as a result of attractiveness. case in point: “high school mean girl” archetypes and rude, jockish guys grew up the most successful people i know, and they are now shaping our society. people with the most horribly abrasive personalities get off scot free if they are beautiful, simply because everyone wants their attention, even if it is negative--while an ugly person behaving the same way would quite literally get the shit beat out of them. who doesnt love living in a world like this.\\n\\nmy own life is proof. people’s first impressions of me were always--awkward, weird, nerdy, etc. meanwhile girls with my exact mannerisms, who were cute and dressed well, were treated like gods in the flesh. i will never forget the disparity between how even authority figures like teachers--who were supposed to be well versed in avoiding bias--treated me vs my more attractive classmates. a female teacher once called another student “the perfect trinity of a woman” (beautiful, smart, kind) or something of those lines. im sorry but the girl in question had no distinguishing traits--that is to say if she was ugly/fat she would be invisible--and still people worshipped the ground she walked on because she was extremely thin and had a full face of makeup on everyday. good for her, but i will always resent that canyon of distance between the way beautiful vs ugly people are treated, even if they have identical personalities, or if the uglier one is actually more pleasant to be around. aside from my own lived experiences, i have witnessed so many average or below average people lose out on opportunities in favour of more attractive counterparts, and no matter how much “everyone is beautiful” shit i am told, i just cant forget everything that i saw and heard in my life until now.\\n\\nnow i am thinner. i fixed my hair and wear it in a way that suits me. i am still not at my goal weight but i have a “natural hourglass” (ugh) with bigger boobs and hips so i get enough romantic attention--this makes me feel sick in of itself, and i still hate the way i look personally, but thats a different topic. what i hate the most--the difference in how i am treated is ASTRONOMICAL. \\n\\nfor the first time in my life people are openly jealous of me. i have now witnessed the “crabs in a bucket” behaviour, even from close friends and family. when i was ugly, me being smart or well spoken was not nearly as much of a threat because i’m sure everyone thought “she’s not getting anywhere with looks like that.” i am still the exact same person i was, but now i seem to incite anger/competitive behaviour because i am not only talented and educated but also attractive. that is it. that is the only difference. before i was considered unworthy of success because i was ugly and fat, and now i am in reach of it, and other people just seem to have a reflex to tear that down. i’ve never seen anything like it before in my life. \\n\\nas for people i dont know, they are WAY kinder to me. men especially seem to think i am way more interesting than i ever was as a fat ugly girl, much to absolutely no one’s surprise. i still talk about the same things, i have the same hobbies, i play the same sports and i listen to the same music--still i am now someone that others want to be friends with or have a chat with. the same “others” that treated me like an animal or a human pet when i was unattractive.\\n\\ni truly believe that, in my heart, i will never be able to trust anyone again. hearing my own parents admit, after years of enabling me and giving me the unhealthiest shit to eat, that i really was fat and undisciplined and disgusting in their eyes--people who were supposed to love me and look out for me. having people who looked down on me try to worm their way into my life. having people who turned me down now hit on me. having people open doors for me, hand me free shit and help me when i dont even look like i need it. I KNOW for a fact that i would not be having all of these benefits if i was still ugly, and it makes me hate everyone, even those that are perfectly kind. \\n\\ni am terrified of showing my \"true self\" to anyone, because for so long my genuine self was treated like filth. only now that i am attractive, everyone suddenly recognizes this “new version” of me as someone worthy of respect and envy--the exact same person as before, just slimmer and done up. and i will never be able to forget that. i havent changed at all aside from my looks, but people act like i was literally blessed by god in front of them. i could be openly rude now and get away with it, not that i ever would want to. i could get away with so much that my ugly self wouldve been instantly crucified for. it’s just the truth.\\n\\nno matter how interesting you are, no matter how funny, no matter how intelligent, curious or kind, you will never be treated as a real, total human being if you are ugly. you will NEVER be afforded the same opportunities or good treatment that beautiful people are. knowing this, living it, how can i NOT be disordered? how can i not want to starve/diet/work out way more than my body can take? i’ve only just stepped into the world of these advantages that other people have been enjoying basically since birth, and i just dont feel guilty or wrong for wanting to stay in it. \\n\\nthe world inherently encourages us to change. the same people telling us all along that we are perfect as we are, treating us like shit. lol   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This time last year I was enveloped in an ED. I was working, but not mentally present. All I had energy for was laying in bed on my phone. I cut myself off my loved ones. I gave up my hobbies. I quit university. Of course there were the physical health issues too. Eventually I became so depressed that the only reason I had for not killing myself was because I wasn't skinny enough yet. \\n\\nFollowing an inpatient stay, a hospital stay, some gained trauma, some panic attacks, health issues, suicidal ideations, a handful of complete nervous breakdowns, gallons of chocolate flavored liquefied ass (If any of y'all have been IP, you know what I mean), months of depression and anxiety, a relapse, some more months of depression and anxiety...\\n\\nI stand (or type heh) before you as someone who beat anorexia. I'm now in university again, working, learning a new language, doing yoga, and gradually learning to love myself. And I sincerely enjoy eating again. Yeah, I'm still learning the ropes around intuitive eating, and yeah, there is still that fear in the back of my head that I'll gain weight if I eat normally, but I know how to combat that now, and that fear gets quieter every day.\\n\\nMy biggest fear is that my mental illnesses will return. But the good news is that even if they do, I feel so much more capable of handling them. I look back on where I was last year and think, \"Wow, I really am one tenacious motherfucker.\"\\n\\nI'm not trying to flaunt my successes. I just wanted to let you know that it does get better and recovery is 100% possible for you. Life goes on, and it is so much more beautiful without an ED in it. I am a living example of that. I thought I'd include some tips that got me to where I am today too, hopefully they'll help someone. \\n\\n1) Laugh through the pain.\\n\\nHumor is a great coping skill. There's humor even in the horrible stuff, and trust me, finding the humor in the tough stuff will make it easier to handle by taking away some of its power in your head. Example: If you don't know this already: you get hella constipated in recovery. Like, HELLA. Your body has no idea what to do with food cuz it's a chump and forgot. In treatment, if you don't shit within a few days they give you mag citrate. And if that doesn't work, an enema. And then you wait. There are two brown liquids in recovery. One is gross, chocolate, high-calorie protein drinks. You can guess what the other is. There were a lot of times everyone would be at dinner or chilling and someone would suddenly be like \"I GOTTA GO OH FUCK\" and book their ass over to the bathroom. On the one hand, super embarrassing. On the other, it was hilarious because pretty much everyone went through it. Shit was common talk among my recovery friends. Moral of the story: There is humor in almost everything, friends. Lean into it to cope.\\n\\n2) Rely on your support system.\\n\\nOne of the stupidest parts about eating disorders is how unavailable treatment is for a lot of people. Treatment is expensive, and your insurance won't always cover it--if you can even afford insurance at all. I was incredibly lucky to be able to get so much help. But if you can't, you're gonna need people. I had to build up my relationships with my loved ones when I decided to recover. And I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have them. It can be hard for people to understand the hell that is an eating disorder, but if they're good friends or family members then they'll try to understand. If you truly feel like you don't have anyone in your life you can rely on, then step one is to start seeking out those relationships however you can. Step two is get on the Internet while you're crafting those relationships. Reddit is full of understanding humans who have great advice and can offer support. Be open to letting people help.\\n\\n3) If all you can do is exist for a while, that's okay.\\n\\nNot gonna lie, it really was all I could do to exist for a hot minute there. Every day was anixety-inducing and overwhelming and depressing. So I stopped trying so hard and did the bare minimum until I had a little more energy to do just a little more, and I built up from there. Yeah, it's important to push yourself, but when you're trying to recover from an eating disorder or depression, it's okay to just focus on eating, sleeping, and shitting for a while. Not forever, but for a while. You don't have to do it all today.\\n\\n4) Accept that you're a tenacious motherfucker whether you like it or not.\\n\\nDetemined! Persistent! Never gives up! Refuses to be destroyed! All of the above mean tenacious. And wow, are humans tenacious. We're incredibly adaptable, living in almost every type of environment throughout history. If you embrace this part of your literal DNA, you'll start realizing you can adapt to more than you think. Including the life you want that no longer features an ED.\\n\\n5) Delete your public social media.\\n\\nStop messing around. There is so much freaking research about how social media has a negative effect on mental health. Bruh. It ain't worth it. For me personally, I have an anonymous IG that I use *only* to follow positive self-help accounts and to communicate with my bff because she doesn't have a cell phone right now. Maybe one day I'll start using it again, but sure as hell not when my pain around comparison and shame is so fresh. If you're seriously trying to recover, social media is only going to make it harder. (Side note: Reddit doesn't count in my book, because almost all of it is anonymous.) \\n\\n6) Swear a lot.\\n\\nIt's so fucking cathartic, man. Swear at diet culture. (Kiss my ass, Chloe Ting Challenges.\" (Mind you, not Chloe Ting herself, she seems like a wonderful person. But her videos aren't for you, bruh.)) Cuss out the plate before you. (\"You think you're tough, bitch? You're nothing but a dick-sucking ham sandwich.\") Cuss at your therapist even. (\"The fuck? Why would I ever even consider family therapy?\") You are entitled to be angry about your situation. ED recovery sucks, and you didn't ask for this. Swearing releases the tension, at least for me. And it makes me laugh lol.\\n\\n7) Don't pretend 'it never happened.'\\n\\nThis is for later on in recovery, but something I tried doing after I was more confident in my abilities was being like, \"Eating disorder? What's an eating disorder? Never heard of her\" for a while. It didn't work. You can't erase trauma. If you pretend it didn't happen, all you are doing is setting yourself up for more triggering situations. Be openminded to the fact that you've been through a very hard thing, and though it isn't part of your narrative now, it *was* undeniably a chapter in your life. You and I both have to make peace with that.\\n\\n8) Maybe there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. Maybe *you're* the light. \\n\\nThis isn't really a tip, but it's a comment I saw somewhere (I don't recall the username, otherwise I'd give them credit) that really slapped me once across the cheek then again on the other. Full disclosure: I don't fully respect myself. I don't fully love myself. (But I don't HATE myself anymore. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm like, \"damn who is she\" and other times, even in the same day, I'll be like, \"who is that nasty-ass upright ape.\" I digress.) You are the light. No one is going to save you but yourself. Even if you can't see it right now, you're glowing, bitch.\\n\\n9) Realize nothing is permanent. \\n\\nIt's the tacky quote hanging above your aunt's toilet. And I love it. If I've learned anything through my *cough* several mental-illness-related breakdowns, it's that emotions don't last forever. And more than that, life itself doesn't last forever. I know this isn't a thought that's comforting when you're in the beginning of recovery, but later on you'll be like, \"Why the hell would I diET and never let myself eat sushi when I have less than 100 years to live and I freaking love sushi? I'll take the goddamn rainbow roll, sir.\" But if you're still in the thick of it, just keep reminding yourself that you're a tenacious motherfucker who lives in a world where things like cats and airplanes and Avatar: The Last Airbender and young Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic exist, and one day those things might be more important to you than an ED if you keep going.\\n\\nJust some things that have helped me. Thanks for reading. Today I am deleting this sub from my favorited list, because I find I no longer need to come here. Thank you for all of the help, advice, support, answers, and compassion I've found in this little sub.\\n\\nIt's a beautiful day, isn't it? See ya around :)   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I’ve had “ anorexia” since I was around 11 years old, and ARFID for as long as I remember (I guess the anorexia would be ARFID+, but I’m not a fan of that label and see it as two separate issues for me. My ARFID feels too separate from my anorexia and vice versa.) The anorexia started at 11 for not body image issues but to gain some control over my life because of trauma, mental health in general, intrusive thoughts, etc. when that was no longer enough to fuel it, it switched to the typical anorexia featuring body image issues, probably partially because I found the ED community online and my self esteem was always wrecked. It turned into this fully. \\n\\nI ended up in a weird place with my family, who would force feed me without getting me treatment and being on my back about it. Eventually, I decided to recover for myself, and had a bit of a struggle phase with that but eventually achieved in my opinion full recovery. And I was happy, so truly happy for awhile. I thought even the most impossible things to cure were cured, like the depression. \\n\\nThen a global pandemic happened. This reset a lot of things for me, but my eating disorder wasn’t affected yet, but there was cracks starting to appear subconsciously because I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism, and found my weight starting to tiptoe into the overweight category. I still didn’t focus too hard on it right away. After all bmi charts aren’t everything. But it kept going like this, and I didn’t even eat much just started to eat normal even though I still had ARFID. I made some strides with ARFID too but I will admit that never left, but at the time I didn’t even know that was disorderly at all. \\n\\nMy weight kept creeping up and it was at a point where I couldn’t ignore it bugging me. I made an edtwt account to just be a bit snarky on about it without really relapsing, but not wanting people to bug me about how unhealthy it was or freak out at me for relapsing, although this is probably a start for relapsing. The account was deactivated because people discovered it was mine which lead to a lot of drama / shame. \\n\\nLeading up to this I knew I’d be moving onto my college campus soon. I was worried this would make me relapse, as I know me being fully in charge of taking care of myself is a… recipe for disaster? Especially because I’d have to walk OUTSIDE for it and stuff so there’s no more convenience? When I moved in though I was good, but the food was kinda bad for my ARFID issues, and I found myself in a tug of war with going to the dining hall or not. Eventually that started to slip, and I also found myself focusing on the ED community again. I relapsed on my anorexia but I was in denial about it because I had a day where I’d eat a normal big meal, with my uncle, at my favorite restaurant, and that I wasn’t “intentionally doing it.” But that didn’t make me living off of vending machine nuts or small bags of chips any better. And I really started hating on my body and anxious about how others perceived it. \\n\\nIn December I went a whole week off little bags of nuts from the vending machine and that’s it until I started feeling really weird symptoms like internal shaking but not outside shaking, the weirdest emotions, uncontrollable tears, dizziness, and weird feelings in my heart. I forced myself to eat at the dining hall after all day of feeling those symptoms. Later that week there was judgements for resident hall Christmas decorations and we were all asked to come and we’d get cookies which I came for originally, but found myself unbearingly overwhelmed about my body size and being seen by others in the hall and left without cookies. \\n\\nNow more recently on break I’ve been having full on ED thoughts. I’ve been doing everything that triggers me: wintergirls, thinspo, bonespo, edtwt, looking at post photos of myself, weighing myself, planning on being a better anorexic, etc. I’ve been fantasizing about going back after break is over (I can’t really be a “good” anorexic here. I have to eat normal here) will be. I’ve been thinking about how great it would be to keep living off nuts but also going to the campus gym more because I’m already paying for it anyway, what the thin version of myself would be, about how I need to do this because my hypothyroid made me blow up so much in weight, etc. it doesn’t help I got sent very triggering comments from abusers basically telling me unprompted that I let myself go and that I am not anorexic nor ever was anorexic and all this shit, calling me fat, ugly, undesirable… basically any meanspo type comment ever that’s made worse by the unsolicited nature of it all. I want to be a “good anorexic” again to prove them wrong, and make everyone worried about me again, all while I would achieve what a “good anorexic” is about with a new ultimate goal weight and everything. \\n\\nBut… is that what I want? I don’t want to fuck up my GPA. I don’t want to have health issues. I don’t want to feel as shitty as I did when I know I was in the thick of it because I was hallucinating then from the lack of nutrients. I got sent a beautiful message the other day from someone I met from edtwt who went to recovery not long after I met them about how I should recover too and totally do it and how I should do it because I want to be able to have babies and I deserve recovery which made me cry because it was all true and validated my feelings. So I want recovery.\\n\\nBut is that what I want either? No. My mind is being very toxic right now about how I need to do this for at least a little while because of my BMI and what hypothyroidism done to me and that nows my opportunity to be able to feel that euphoria from restricting again which I have truly missed. And feel like I need because so much is going wrong for me right now and it all falls back into control issues deep down and I just miss being sick again and the things I romanticized about it all.\\n\\nMy mind is so toxic. I’m here crying because I don’t know what I want and I don’t know if I care enough to want better anymore and feel so guilty about how I threw that recovery era all away but I now also loathe that era more than anything. I don’t know. \\n\\nI don’t want help either.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                               \\n\\nSo my church has a weekly potluck lunch and for awhile I’d just avoid eating much because it’s hard to feel safe, even when I track, if it’s other people’s food. But then brilliant me had an idea.\\n\\nMy ED is a small part influenced by guilt about money and spending it on food on me specifically. So I decided, heck, this is free food, I’ll OMAD it and that’ll be that. Then I upped my limit for that OMAD, from &gt;!up to 800!&lt; to &gt;!1200.!&lt; Basically allowing myself to “binge” once a week with some decreased guilt on all levels. \\n\\nBut here’s where the fuckup begins. Last time, or some time recently, I ended up triggering an actual binge that lasted a few days because of this OMAD where I kept going back into the kitchen for more pieces of everything, no shame whatsoever. Ok maybe a little but my feral, food-obsessed brain was stronger, for once, than my social anxiety. \\n\\nAnyway, I’ve been back to mid/high res which is my usual goal, and then this week I’m not really even that hungry coming into the lunch. It’s smaller, too, not as many people, so not as many different options. And it’s spaghetti etc which is high cal in SUCH low amounts, which is, obviously, quite scary. \\n\\nI didn’t even need to try to skip breakfast (helped that I slept in) and I wasn’t thinking I even wanted much so I got a small plate. Not by ED standards but by general standards it was small. \\n\\nI can’t remember when the shift happened, but I unlocked this binge urge, though I resisted throughout the times I gave in too. Meaning, I had a second piece of garlic bread but not a fourth. (Wow, such willpower.) \\n\\nAnd then I end up grabbing a bowl of veggies (which I ate a decent amount of anyway because cherry tomatoes can GET IT and it was the best celery I’d ever tasted for some reason) and walking around with it in an attempt to satisfy the binge urges by volume eating. I’d already eaten what was basically maintenance so I was trying to ease out of a mindset where I’d keep eating. \\n\\nSo I go and do some random games with some friends and I lose the urge to keep shoveling bread in my mouth like a starved Victorian orphan. \\n\\nBut of course, it doesn’t end here, because I’m still at maintenance and the universe apparently wishes me ill. \\n\\nSomeone decides it’ll be a great idea to get ice cream. And I make some excuses about allergies but it doesn’t work and I eat an ice cream cone. Not gonna lie, it was amazing. I haven’t had one in a while just because it’s winter as well as for obvious reasons. And I enjoyed it. I refused to let myself NOT enjoy it, because I was basically forced to eat it. (Not really but I can’t walk over and throw away an ice cream cone in front of the person who gave it to me. And no matter what YOU would do, I’M not going to shove it in my pocket :) 😉)\\n\\nSo it was a good cone. And it was a bad occurrence. Because it re-aroused the binge beast and I had to get another bowl of lettuce to avoid tipping the table into my mouth. \\n\\nFortunately when I left the room again and then came back with a bit of binge intentions, the food had already been cleaned up. \\n\\nBut now I get in the car with my family and my parents are starving because they didn’t eat much. So we go get some snacks at the store and I get given a portion, which, again, I have no convenient hidey-hole in which to shove. \\n\\nSo I end up at &gt;!2,000!&lt; which I’m like, fuck. But ok, I did a lot of exercise playing games so I’m probably ok just for today. And I think I’m done and I should be satisfied, RIGHT??\\n\\nBut then I feel the need to eat, not 1, not 2, nor yet again 3. Not even 4, but FIVE protein bars which are NOT low calorie. I’m running around doing chores literally ravenous and stifling moans of hunger while I shove these protein bars in my mouth. \\n\\nThen I think I’m done. I did a few reps of weights so I can feel like I’m gaining something good from this insane saga. Hey, if I’m going to eat &gt;!3,500!&lt; might as well get them gains, right? :,)\\n\\nExercise can generally turn off some of my binge urges so I think I’m good.\\n\\nThen, I have no recollection how, I decided to eat just o\\^n\\^e more thing. Maybe it was because I still have this weird belief I have to eat the protein after I workout or else it won’t work. That’s not true, right? 🤨\\n\\nTo make a very long story shorter, I ended up spooning sunflower butter, after carefully measuring and then just saying, screw it im eating from the jar, as the fam walks into the room. So we leave to go somewhere else and for 15 minutes after we leave I’m thinking about this food and I’m wishing I had brought it. Then I lose the urge to eat and I’m grateful I didn’t bring it. \\n\\nThen we come home and I’m stupid so I eat a little bit of what I don’t necessarily feel a huge urge to eat but I do feel somewhat hungry and everyone else is having snacks so I have one too. \\n\\nI have to mention, at this point my stomach is quite full, kind of hard from all the food packed in it, but I’m still HUNGRY. I’m freaking ravenous. That was how I felt the entire day when I felt this insane urge to eat and eat and eat. \\n\\nAnyway, I eat snacks with my siblings, and I end the day at a glorious &gt;!4,300!&lt; cals. Dude. \\n\\nThe thing is, I know that todays weight isn’t real, just food weight, but I also know that this brought my week’s average almost up to a point where it doesn’t even out to me restricting at all. \\n\\nBut I still can’t feel that much guilt or panic, which in a sense is good, but so, so odd. \\n\\nNot sure if I’ve started a binge/restrict cycle, so pretty scared of that, but I haven’t yet decided what to do about today. Should I ease down by eating maintenance and lowering, or should I go back to normal mid-high res? I guess I’ll see what happens. I’m still full from yesterday and I have to focus on ✨life✨ what a glorious concept. Other things are boring but my ed always have something interesting to throw at me 🤪😭\\n\\nIdk why I took the time to write this but hopefully it isn't completely illegible and boring.

then restricting. the guy i’m seeing knows i lost weight but not about my ED and right now i’m in a bit of a binge cycle.\\n\\nhe wasn’t trying to be mean, more-so impressed when he said “wow, you ate a lot” after i had just polished off a burger fries. i said “yeah, i keep eating a lot” to which he responded “yeah, by the time you leave my house you’ll be your SW again”\\n\\ndamn… i don’t know if

relapsing into AN again. And now my hair is falling out again AND I keep it long so I feel like the thinning is extra noticeable. My hair is the only thing I like about myself + the main way I express myself and fuck it’s falling out again I cannot believe this (well I can but. you know what I mean.) I’ve tried hair vitamins before in the past but they didn’t really help so I guess I’m doomed to be bald in my 20s idk   \n",

Gained 35lbs back since in 2022. I am stuck in a binging cycle it’s been months. I’m gaining rapidly. I lost the weight by starving myself and over exercising daily. I had a seizure in March 2022, became bedbound and binged daily for comfort. I have such an unhealthy relationship with food. I’m at 225lbs now, and don’t want to gain more. But I don’t want to starve myself and set myself up for failure. I don’t even care if I loose I just don’t want to keep gaining. Thank you for letting me vent!   \n",

I’m scared to tell my boyfriend…we haven’t been together long and he hasn’t been with me when I’ve been actively purging. I’ve joked about it / mentioned it as a past thing but I’m not sure if he realises what it truly means. I’m scared he will be grossed out by me. My next therapy appointment isn’t til January but even so I know all the things I need to do to get better I’m just so annoyed with myself that I’m still going through yet again. Fuck this disease.   \n",

And it's a huge reason why I've been obsessed with my weight and being as thin as possible. Part of me is like \"I'll never look thin or skinny because I've got a wide waist and rib cage\" and then another part is like \"Even though my stomach is concave, it doesn't even count since it's only because I have a big rib cage giving the illusion of skinniness.\" I'm just upset today and it's getting to me, no matter what I do I can't change this   \n",

       "      <td>So I was looking into ARFID + apparently the border between ARFID + eds like anorexia is a concern w weight + stuff like that, but I know it's very possible to have both, normally though people had ARFID first + often since early childhood.\\n\\nShould probably put here I'm not asking for you to tell me if I have ARFID or not, I'll leave that to a professional when I can see one\\n\\nI don't know if I have ARFID, but I was wondering if it's even worth bringing up as a possibility when I finally get a new team. My current diagnosis is bulimia, although my behaviours most resemble anorexia atm but eh let's just leave it as \"og ed\" for now as the behaviours were in place before this new food struggle + I don't wanna claim which one I have fs as idk atm\\n\\nI've always had lots of difficulties w food due to my autism, often texture smell + colour (I can eat foods that taste bad, I just prefer not to ofc) leading to occasional nutritional difficulties (iron + vitamin D) + once when I was placed in inpatient + they chose not to accommodate my autism food needs (they could have as they did for another patient) I lost a significant amount of weight as I chose to not eat anything instead of eating the bad foods.\\n\\nHowever recently my swallowing got to the point where many foods keep getting stuck in my throat + as a result I've significantly cut down the amount of foods I feel I can eat + I'm normally having to have 2 protein shakes a day (1 w added vitamins + minerals) + a gummy vitamin to keep a diet that mostly meets my nutritional needs (not fully bc I'm still restricting, but before then I'd have more normal foods like meat + fruits I now can't eat). I won't count my weightloss towards it as that is intentional + don't have my next full blood count until the end of the year so won't know if I'm deficient in anything until then but doubt I am\\n\\nI feel like before I would have had it easily explained by my autism diagnosis as I was still eating a pretty large variety of food + other than the occasional deficiency I didn't have any issues as I could eat a large variety of foods, just there were still a fair few I wouldn't eat but now it's definitely so much worse + is really impacting my social life as I'm scared to go out for a meal or stay at my mum's as I know it'll be hard to find food I can eat. I ordered protein shakes to my mum's house as I'm getting the train down soon + I want smth I know I can eat. I do however have a great desire to lose weight stemming from the og ed which apparently can mean you don't qualify as having ARFID? But honestly these restrictions have nothing to do w my weight + body - lots of them are low calorie nutritionally desne foods I've eaten v happily when restricting like chicken breasts + peaches or foods I've still loved throughout my ed + still counted as safe foods as the texture was fine, I'd just limit the portions like onion rings + chicken nuggets\\n\\nI think I would like to change it. I miss foods like chicken breasts + wings + stuff, I'm just really worried about it getting stuck as many foods were getting stuck + once I ||was retching + coughing + drooling so hard from having smth stuck. Water didn't work, fizzy drink didn't work, more food didn't work I just had to wait|| it was honestly rly awful + likely what caused me to refuse to eat so many foods that haven't got stuck before. Idk, I think it is a very valid fear but also I think I've taken it to an extreme length as a fair amount of these foods haven't got stuck just I'm too scared to try them incase they do + honestly I'm an adult, I can eat what I want, I don't see why I should have to. But then I really want to eat them. Idk ig I'm conflicted?\\n\\nSorry this is a massive text wall I ramble a lot. Tldr; can ARFID develop after an eating disorder like anorexia/bulimia is already developed? Is it worth bringing up the possibility of arfid when a bulimia diagnosis is already in place? I'm not asking for you to diagnose me or tell me what I have don't worry, just if it's worth going down that avenue or if I should just leave it?</td>\n",

       "      <td>There are spelling/grammar errors because this is the first draft :). I want opinions, is this dumb?\\nI’m 19. This took me like 2 weeks to write. It’s very 🦋 just hopefully not to much. \\n\\nHushed \\nThere lays a corps of hushed whispers. A hollowed out girl, Lingering the taste of a silver pain. water bounces off bone as if shattering glass, as I fade into a ghost less and less notice me. I speak but yet no one hears me. Blowing like a piece of chiffon on a clothesline with wooden pins. Unnoticed yet everlasting delicate. A softness on the scale shall show. Sublime nothing, nostalgic, and lost. A feeling of slow dancing angels, waltz across a heart shattered into tears of ice. A girl frozen under a lake. People speak but no one is there, just the ghost girl. Bruised hips, elegant and blue, worn, and gentle. showing the worked edges of laced pointe shoe ribbons satin and stern. of what’s left. skin rolled thinner than a pastry, over frail bones. The pain trying to escape through an art you’ve created and mastered. Turned into a live display of trauma. A collision from within. Wishing the warmth of a fire would warm a frozen soul. A bitter coffee won’t fix the bitter myself I have became. My mind follows behind my like a soft shadow, my lagging thoughts behind.  I find myself pondering the thought, will they notice when I’m gone? No one notices the fade so will they notice when I shrink into nothing? The scoff of contempt. The envy. Dark yet so fine. A line of ink is as far as I may go. Lost in a world of bitter blue bruises and finger tips. So thin walking on a cloud of wind, as it wisks me away with the supple smell of a chocolate morsel, remembering the days it’s taste was the concern. A crunch of numbers, everywhere lays a trap of never ending equation all that is of importance is they equate to zero. Zero is a magic number meaning nothing, meaning lost, and free from the hate and infinite escape from within. I get lost in that thought. Tiptoeing on the luck of clover, praying for success yet walking on a tightrope between alive and the corpse I dream. A voice that Carey’s down narrow hallways only to be forgotten.. the ghost will fade. A shimmer in my eyes is dulled as I am a shell. A match box of a girl, strike a conversation and I may blow up in flame. Brittle legs dwindle beneath me each step as though I’m crushed beneath the ground. The breath knocked out of me, the air feels shallow and brisk, ache as I exhale. A hug, hands running across my back a feeling of ribs being crushed under an immense pound of love and emotion, each rib like a rosary bead.. what’s left of me is nothing more then the shadow beneath my rib cage. A bird trying to escape through, to tightly woven my mind. A hungry jaw. My shoulder blades will soon be wings so I can fly safely. the hallowed out girl somehow inspired by a word. A mound of blankets beneath the ghost girl lays unsure if I will rise again. A palace of pillows for the brittle bones, that so desperately wish to escape.. no moments matter when no one knows you’re dying in silence. No one hears the scream of a child trapped under the broken image. Un-healed, lost in a trance of words so descriptive yet still in unable to explain. Purple eyelids wish me to sleep each night, into a world of dreams, yet even that isn’t pure, for many get lost in numbers and lard.. pizza cheese strings stick the dreams together waking in a fright. A frenzy, a fairy, a broken record, plays the same background music for me to seep myself into as I fade my colors to gray. A sewing machine stitching together my pattern of life. Un inspired, sidewalk of a girl, no getting through, so I should be walked on. A desperation to see the angels I’ve been talking too, yet a will to for fill for the other in life. Love is a quiet quest I will never endeavor, not for I don’t want it, but for I don’t wish people to hurt as a fade to the void of nothing. I’m a ghost.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm assuming there will be a few food bloggers or influencers on here. Did you start doing that before ED or after/during? How did it influence your relationship with food and body?\\n\\nI used to be one. At first I thought that was during recovered area when really it was just my binge era. It definitely helped me learn to get excited over food again and appreciate it. But it also had obsessive tendencies and eventually made me over focus on food. The friends I made during that time are usually picked by their passion for food. Foodies. And now that I'm ✨back on my bs, I barely have any connecting interests with them. I don't want to discuss junkfood. I don't want to check out new restaurants with them. I don't want to share a friendship that's a cycle of gifting and receiving little special snacks. I don't want to meet up ti share a binge on \"healthy carbs\". And I realised that, without all that, these friendships are so shallow. Some of these people share the most opposite opinions on core values of mine. Some of them have aggressive hate on thin women and label it as \"body positivity\". Some of them are just super boring to me. And I am probably to them. I have so many interests and passions that aren't food or ED related that I can't share with the friends I made during that time. When I relapsed, all the lockdowns hit, and so it got very isolating for a while. Not able to organically make new friends. I stopped posting on my social media because I didn't feel the connection to that issue anymore. Eventhough it became my job for years so I can't just throw it away like that. I tried getting back to it a few times. But it's so exhausting. It's literally the opposite of what I'm now, yet none of these states were \"normal\" or \"healthy\". But covering up my binge era as being a \"foodie\" is so much more marketable than being a health conscious ortho/AN person. So much more socially acceptable. Really, nobody ever doubted my health and mental state during that time.\\n\\nI think my binge era initiated me into becoming a food influencer, while my other ED eventually turned me away from it. And I feel like I can't ever do the same type of content in my current mindset: I want to maintain a certain body that simply doesn't fit my binge eating behaviour. I'm scared of trying to get back into it and being shamed for participation in diet culture. I feel like I will have to cover up who I have become. Of course I would want do my best to avoid extremely obvious and triggering posts like \"omg this single rice cake with cinnamon and a slice of apple was the best lunch in my life, I feel so full!!!\"... I do have some self awareness. But even during that binge era I noticed how easily people would get upset with me and others if my content wasn't 100% fun food. A salad once in a while would be enough to upset a lot of followers- and normal people can totally have salad, especially those with really nice dressings and toppings that easily reach &amp;gt;! 600-900!&amp;lt; cals per serving. I'm really fed up with everyone policing everybody online. Of course problematic content exists: problematic eating behaviour, and problematic body checking. But I think it's super wrong to call out every existing non overweight body and every meal that doesn't equal the typical fun foods/ soul foods/ junk food and then scream \"You're promoting diet culture\". I have always shyed away from showing my body and showing anything close to my personal eating as in \"WIEIAD\" or \"this is the exact amount I would have for dinner\". Always kept it vague because it wasn't about the amounts or the calories or whatever. My content was supposed to be about experience. Taste. Consistency. Excitement. But not the whole body diet whatsoever issue. And I eventually stopped producing content because I was so annoyed with the growing amount of people that would put mean intentions into just everyone's food related actions online. Like a witch hunt. \\n\\nI feel like a lot of food influencers [secretly] have some type of ED. What's your experience with that?</td>\n",

       "      <td>Growing up, I was the eldest of three, a “gifted” kid who excelled at anything she set her mind to, and overall a happy person. I was headstrong, and above all, I thought very highly of myself. I remember comments about my body. I was the chubbiest of my siblings, with a naturally model-esque younger sister. But that didn’t deter me from loving myself.\\n\\nI developed early, with massive honkers by early high school, relatively taller than my classmates and always a bit tubby. I didn’t start looking at myself critically until my first boyfriend made comments about my body. Over the course of my final years in high school, I started noticing weight gain. I loved food. I turned to it as an emotional escape. Getting to college I put on even more. \\n\\nBy the end of my freshman year I was overweight. I resolved to lose weight, and did it in a healthy manner. I still grasped on to the vestiges of my youthful confidence when I was alone, but with others I constantly compared myself and more often than not came out less than.\\n\\nThe weight-loss stalled when I was in the average BMI range. I wasn’t as thin as I wanted, but I was happy. When my relationship at the time ended, I gained more confidence than ever. Covid struck, a blessing in disguise as I had fewer people to compare myself to.\\n\\nThat was until a game night with friends, one of my closest friends admitted that she found our other friend prettier than she found me. Suddenly, my carefully curated confidence crumbled. I had formed walls of glass around my body image, supported by the buttresses of isolation, and in one felled swoop the girl I trusted most stomped the whole thing to shit.\\n\\nHere’s where my wannarexia phase started. I launched into a cycle of restrict, binge, and then I learned how to purge. I never lost weight. I simply maintained, and by maintained I mean whipped between weights above and below my original weight. I romanticized the ED then. The beautifully twisted, angsty lines that circulate tumblr, twitter, that seemed to echo the ideal I wanted for myself. I felt pride in my isolated hell, thinking myself better for it. No one knows what I’m going through and that makes me different, stronger, and better than them.\\n\\nI had no clue what it meant for things to get real.\\n\\nFood was always a comfort for me, so when my life actually started to get hard, and when I lost control of stress, control over food was the only thing I had left.\\n\\nNow I sit, underweight, with worried parents, no energy to do what I love. When I’m bored, instead of creating beautiful things or forming beautiful connections with people, I spend hours recklessly binging and then meticulously purging. My free-time is consumed by food and all I can do now is mindlessly follow along.\\n\\nI feel sick and disgusting, and I know i won’t be able to stop anytime soon. I want this all to be over, but I have no hope for resolution. \\n\\nI wish I could go back to the naïveté, the blind confidence. I feel like a shell of who I was. I don’t feel cool or unique. I spend more time gazing into a toilet bowl than I do anything remotely fun.\\n\\nI hate that I didn’t get the help I needed when I hated myself, and now I’m stuck paying with my life.\\n\\nSo please, no body is worth the sacrifice, or the “cool” quotes, it’s all so meaningless when you can’t look at yourself in the mirror for the shame of another day of failures.\\n\\nI just want my mom to hold me and make it all go away, but this is the real world and I don’t know how much longer I can stand that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I'm a very very picky eater, I only eat a very small variety of foods. Thankfully the kind of food I eat allows me to have a diet that is very simple but varied enough, I've done tests and I'm relatively healthy in terms of the nutrients/vitamins I eat and all that. But it's still a big issue in my life that makes me really ashamed of myself when I eat with other people, and it makes it much more difficult for me to gain weight (I'm very thin and I'd like to build more muscle). \\n\\nThe worst part is that most of the food that I don't eat isn't because I don't like how it tastes: I have never tried them. Sometimes I have tried them before and disliked its taste or texture, but most times I haven't and I just assume that I won't like it, sometimes based on how it looks, how it smells, because I don't know what it's made of, or just because it's something new. I don't know the exact reasons why, but my brain automatically discards every food except the few I already like. I get so stubborn that even if I force myself to trying something new, I already go with the mentality that I will hate it, and most times that's what ends up happening. This is especially the case if I'm pressured by other people to try something, it automatically makes me want to dislike it much more. I've found that if I'm by myself and I try something new without no one else noticing (doesn't happen often though), I'll be more open to actually deciding whether I like it or not, rather than just denying liking it. That's how I discovered I do like pizza, despite having refused to try it for like 20 years. But for many things, I'm automatically put off when I look at it or think about eating it.\\n\\nFor example, I automatically hate anything that has cheese (pizza being the only exception), fish, seafood, or vegetables, even many fruits. I would love to like all of that, to have normal eating habits and not ashame myself in front of everyone when they find about what I like/dislike (it always turns into an interrogatory of \"do you like X?\" \"do you like Y?\" \"not even Z???\" which I absolutely hate). But I just can't.\\n\\nAccording to my doctor, as long as I'm physically healthy all of this is not an issue, \"just a quirk\". A therapist I went to a few years ago kinda said the same thing and never touched the topic again. According to my family and friends, and well basically everyone I've talked to about this, \"it's as simple as trying more food!\", but they don't understand that that's exactly what I have issues with!! And it being so simple makes me feel very bad about myself for failing to do something that apparently is so easy.\\n\\nI don't know if this is an eating disorder, or if I'm just a picky eater and that's it. Everything I've found online is directed to little kids, which means that this is probably not too common with adults. I have certainly never met anyone like me. \\n\\nI don't know either whether I should go to a therapist, a psychiatrist, a nutritionist or a dietist to get help. Or all of them. I'm not looking for advice on how to improve with this post, I just want to know what's going on with me. I've never had any kind of support, empathy or understanding about this topic in my life, only shame and comfrontation, so I'd like to know if it's really something I should feel bad about or if it's an actual disorder that I have.</td>\n",

       "8046   So I was looking into ARFID + apparently the border between ARFID + eds like anorexia is a concern w weight + stuff like that, but I know it's very possible to have both, normally though people had ARFID first + often since early childhood.\\n\\nShould probably put here I'm not asking for you to tell me if I have ARFID or not, I'll leave that to a professional when I can see one\\n\\nI don't know if I have ARFID, but I was wondering if it's even worth bringing up as a possibility when I finally get a new team. My current diagnosis is bulimia, although my behaviours most resemble anorexia atm but eh let's just leave it as \"og ed\" for now as the behaviours were in place before this new food struggle + I don't wanna claim which one I have fs as idk atm\\n\\nI've always had lots of difficulties w food due to my autism, often texture smell + colour (I can eat foods that taste bad, I just prefer not to ofc) leading to occasional nutritional difficulties (iron + vitamin D) + once when I was placed in inpatient + they chose not to accommodate my autism food needs (they could have as they did for another patient) I lost a significant amount of weight as I chose to not eat anything instead of eating the bad foods.\\n\\nHowever recently my swallowing got to the point where many foods keep getting stuck in my throat + as a result I've significantly cut down the amount of foods I feel I can eat + I'm normally having to have 2 protein shakes a day (1 w added vitamins + minerals) + a gummy vitamin to keep a diet that mostly meets my nutritional needs (not fully bc I'm still restricting, but before then I'd have more normal foods like meat + fruits I now can't eat). I won't count my weightloss towards it as that is intentional + don't have my next full blood count until the end of the year so won't know if I'm deficient in anything until then but doubt I am\\n\\nI feel like before I would have had it easily explained by my autism diagnosis as I was still eating a pretty large variety of food + other than the occasional deficiency I didn't have any issues as I could eat a large variety of foods, just there were still a fair few I wouldn't eat but now it's definitely so much worse + is really impacting my social life as I'm scared to go out for a meal or stay at my mum's as I know it'll be hard to find food I can eat. I ordered protein shakes to my mum's house as I'm getting the train down soon + I want smth I know I can eat. I do however have a great desire to lose weight stemming from the og ed which apparently can mean you don't qualify as having ARFID? But honestly these restrictions have nothing to do w my weight + body - lots of them are low calorie nutritionally desne foods I've eaten v happily when restricting like chicken breasts + peaches or foods I've still loved throughout my ed + still counted as safe foods as the texture was fine, I'd just limit the portions like onion rings + chicken nuggets\\n\\nI think I would like to change it. I miss foods like chicken breasts + wings + stuff, I'm just really worried about it getting stuck as many foods were getting stuck + once I ||was retching + coughing + drooling so hard from having smth stuck. Water didn't work, fizzy drink didn't work, more food didn't work I just had to wait|| it was honestly rly awful + likely what caused me to refuse to eat so many foods that haven't got stuck before. Idk, I think it is a very valid fear but also I think I've taken it to an extreme length as a fair amount of these foods haven't got stuck just I'm too scared to try them incase they do + honestly I'm an adult, I can eat what I want, I don't see why I should have to. But then I really want to eat them. Idk ig I'm conflicted?\\n\\nSorry this is a massive text wall I ramble a lot. Tldr; can ARFID develop after an eating disorder like anorexia/bulimia is already developed? Is it worth bringing up the possibility of arfid when a bulimia diagnosis is already in place? I'm not asking for you to diagnose me or tell me what I have don't worry, just if it's worth going down that avenue or if I should just leave it?   \n",
       "10621                                                                                                                                                         There are spelling/grammar errors because this is the first draft :). I want opinions, is this dumb?\\nI’m 19. This took me like 2 weeks to write. It’s very 🦋 just hopefully not to much. \\n\\nHushed \\nThere lays a corps of hushed whispers. A hollowed out girl, Lingering the taste of a silver pain. water bounces off bone as if shattering glass, as I fade into a ghost less and less notice me. I speak but yet no one hears me. Blowing like a piece of chiffon on a clothesline with wooden pins. Unnoticed yet everlasting delicate. A softness on the scale shall show. Sublime nothing, nostalgic, and lost. A feeling of slow dancing angels, waltz across a heart shattered into tears of ice. A girl frozen under a lake. People speak but no one is there, just the ghost girl. Bruised hips, elegant and blue, worn, and gentle. showing the worked edges of laced pointe shoe ribbons satin and stern. of what’s left. skin rolled thinner than a pastry, over frail bones. The pain trying to escape through an art you’ve created and mastered. Turned into a live display of trauma. A collision from within. Wishing the warmth of a fire would warm a frozen soul. A bitter coffee won’t fix the bitter myself I have became. My mind follows behind my like a soft shadow, my lagging thoughts behind.  I find myself pondering the thought, will they notice when I’m gone? No one notices the fade so will they notice when I shrink into nothing? The scoff of contempt. The envy. Dark yet so fine. A line of ink is as far as I may go. Lost in a world of bitter blue bruises and finger tips. So thin walking on a cloud of wind, as it wisks me away with the supple smell of a chocolate morsel, remembering the days it’s taste was the concern. A crunch of numbers, everywhere lays a trap of never ending equation all that is of importance is they equate to zero. Zero is a magic number meaning nothing, meaning lost, and free from the hate and infinite escape from within. I get lost in that thought. Tiptoeing on the luck of clover, praying for success yet walking on a tightrope between alive and the corpse I dream. A voice that Carey’s down narrow hallways only to be forgotten.. the ghost will fade. A shimmer in my eyes is dulled as I am a shell. A match box of a girl, strike a conversation and I may blow up in flame. Brittle legs dwindle beneath me each step as though I’m crushed beneath the ground. The breath knocked out of me, the air feels shallow and brisk, ache as I exhale. A hug, hands running across my back a feeling of ribs being crushed under an immense pound of love and emotion, each rib like a rosary bead.. what’s left of me is nothing more then the shadow beneath my rib cage. A bird trying to escape through, to tightly woven my mind. A hungry jaw. My shoulder blades will soon be wings so I can fly safely. the hallowed out girl somehow inspired by a word. A mound of blankets beneath the ghost girl lays unsure if I will rise again. A palace of pillows for the brittle bones, that so desperately wish to escape.. no moments matter when no one knows you’re dying in silence. No one hears the scream of a child trapped under the broken image. Un-healed, lost in a trance of words so descriptive yet still in unable to explain. Purple eyelids wish me to sleep each night, into a world of dreams, yet even that isn’t pure, for many get lost in numbers and lard.. pizza cheese strings stick the dreams together waking in a fright. A frenzy, a fairy, a broken record, plays the same background music for me to seep myself into as I fade my colors to gray. A sewing machine stitching together my pattern of life. Un inspired, sidewalk of a girl, no getting through, so I should be walked on. A desperation to see the angels I’ve been talking too, yet a will to for fill for the other in life. Love is a quiet quest I will never endeavor, not for I don’t want it, but for I don’t wish people to hurt as a fade to the void of nothing. I’m a ghost.   \n",
       "8933                           I'm assuming there will be a few food bloggers or influencers on here. Did you start doing that before ED or after/during? How did it influence your relationship with food and body?\\n\\nI used to be one. At first I thought that was during recovered area when really it was just my binge era. It definitely helped me learn to get excited over food again and appreciate it. But it also had obsessive tendencies and eventually made me over focus on food. The friends I made during that time are usually picked by their passion for food. Foodies. And now that I'm ✨back on my bs, I barely have any connecting interests with them. I don't want to discuss junkfood. I don't want to check out new restaurants with them. I don't want to share a friendship that's a cycle of gifting and receiving little special snacks. I don't want to meet up ti share a binge on \"healthy carbs\". And I realised that, without all that, these friendships are so shallow. Some of these people share the most opposite opinions on core values of mine. Some of them have aggressive hate on thin women and label it as \"body positivity\". Some of them are just super boring to me. And I am probably to them. I have so many interests and passions that aren't food or ED related that I can't share with the friends I made during that time. When I relapsed, all the lockdowns hit, and so it got very isolating for a while. Not able to organically make new friends. I stopped posting on my social media because I didn't feel the connection to that issue anymore. Eventhough it became my job for years so I can't just throw it away like that. I tried getting back to it a few times. But it's so exhausting. It's literally the opposite of what I'm now, yet none of these states were \"normal\" or \"healthy\". But covering up my binge era as being a \"foodie\" is so much more marketable than being a health conscious ortho/AN person. So much more socially acceptable. Really, nobody ever doubted my health and mental state during that time.\\n\\nI think my binge era initiated me into becoming a food influencer, while my other ED eventually turned me away from it. And I feel like I can't ever do the same type of content in my current mindset: I want to maintain a certain body that simply doesn't fit my binge eating behaviour. I'm scared of trying to get back into it and being shamed for participation in diet culture. I feel like I will have to cover up who I have become. Of course I would want do my best to avoid extremely obvious and triggering posts like \"omg this single rice cake with cinnamon and a slice of apple was the best lunch in my life, I feel so full!!!\"... I do have some self awareness. But even during that binge era I noticed how easily people would get upset with me and others if my content wasn't 100% fun food. A salad once in a while would be enough to upset a lot of followers- and normal people can totally have salad, especially those with really nice dressings and toppings that easily reach &gt;! 600-900!&lt; cals per serving. I'm really fed up with everyone policing everybody online. Of course problematic content exists: problematic eating behaviour, and problematic body checking. But I think it's super wrong to call out every existing non overweight body and every meal that doesn't equal the typical fun foods/ soul foods/ junk food and then scream \"You're promoting diet culture\". I have always shyed away from showing my body and showing anything close to my personal eating as in \"WIEIAD\" or \"this is the exact amount I would have for dinner\". Always kept it vague because it wasn't about the amounts or the calories or whatever. My content was supposed to be about experience. Taste. Consistency. Excitement. But not the whole body diet whatsoever issue. And I eventually stopped producing content because I was so annoyed with the growing amount of people that would put mean intentions into just everyone's food related actions online. Like a witch hunt. \\n\\nI feel like a lot of food influencers [secretly] have some type of ED. What's your experience with that?   \n",

I was headstrong, and above all, I thought very highly of myself. I remember comments about my body. I was the chubbiest of my siblings, with a naturally model-esque younger sister. But that didn’t deter me from loving myself.\\n\\nI developed early, with massive honkers by early high school, relatively taller than my classmates and always a bit tubby. I didn’t start looking at myself critically until my first boyfriend made comments about my body. Over the course of my final years in high school, I started noticing weight gain. I loved food. I turned to it as an emotional escape. Getting to college I put on even more. \\n\\nBy the end of my freshman year I was overweight. I resolved to lose weight, and did it in a healthy manner. I still grasped on to the vestiges of my youthful confidence when I was alone, but with others I constantly compared myself and more often than not came out less than.\\n\\nThe weight-loss stalled when I was in the average BMI range. I wasn’t as thin as I wanted, but I was happy. When my relationship at the time ended, I gained more confidence than ever. Covid struck, a blessing in disguise as I had fewer people to compare myself to.\\n\\nThat was until a game night with friends, one of my closest friends admitted that she found our other friend prettier than she found me. Suddenly, my carefully curated confidence crumbled. I had formed walls of glass around my body image, supported by the buttresses of isolation, and in one felled swoop the girl I trusted most stomped the whole thing to shit.\\n\\nHere’s where my wannarexia phase started. I launched into a cycle of restrict, binge, and then I learned how to purge. I never lost weight. I simply maintained, and by maintained I mean whipped between weights above and below my original weight. I romanticized the ED then. The beautifully twisted, angsty lines that circulate tumblr, twitter, that seemed to echo the ideal I wanted for myself. I felt pride in my isolated hell, thinking myself better for it. No one knows what I’m going through and that makes me different, stronger, and better than them.\\n\\nI had no clue what it meant for things to get real.\\n\\nFood was always a comfort for me, so when my life actually started to get hard, and when I lost control of stress, control over food was the only thing I had left.\\n\\nNow I sit, underweight, with worried parents, no energy to do what I love. When I’m bored, instead of creating beautiful things or forming beautiful connections with people, I spend hours recklessly binging and then meticulously purging. My free-time is consumed by food and all I can do now is mindlessly follow along.\\n\\nI feel sick and disgusting, and I know i won’t be able to stop anytime soon. I want this all to be over, but I have no hope for resolution. \\n\\nI wish I could go back to the naïveté, the blind confidence. I feel like a shell of who I was. I don’t feel cool or unique. I spend more time gazing into a toilet bowl than I do anything remotely fun.\\n\\nI hate that I didn’t get the help I needed when I hated myself, and now I’m stuck paying with my life.\\n\\nSo please, no body is worth the sacrifice, or the “cool” quotes, it’s all so meaningless when you can’t look at yourself in the mirror for the shame of another day of failures.\\n\\nI just want my mom to hold me and make it all go away, but this is the real world and I don’t know how much longer I can stand that.   \n",

Thankfully the kind of food I eat allows me to have a diet that is very simple but varied enough, I've done tests and I'm relatively healthy in terms of the nutrients/vitamins I eat and all that. But it's still a big issue in my life that makes me really ashamed of myself when I eat with other people, and it makes it much more difficult for me to gain weight (I'm very thin and I'd like to build more muscle). \\n\\nThe worst part is that most of the food that I don't eat isn't because I don't like how it tastes: I have never tried them. Sometimes I have tried them before and disliked its taste or texture, but most times I haven't and I just assume that I won't like it, sometimes based on how it looks, how it smells, because I don't know what it's made of, or just because it's something new. I don't know the exact reasons why, but my brain automatically discards every food except the few I already like. I get so stubborn that even if I force myself to trying something new, I already go with the mentality that I will hate it, and most times that's what ends up happening. This is especially the case if I'm pressured by other people to try something, it automatically makes me want to dislike it much more. I've found that if I'm by myself and I try something new without no one else noticing (doesn't happen often though), I'll be more open to actually deciding whether I like it or not, rather than just denying liking it. That's how I discovered I do like pizza, despite having refused to try it for like 20 years. But for many things, I'm automatically put off when I look at it or think about eating it.\\n\\nFor example, I automatically hate anything that has cheese (pizza being the only exception), fish, seafood, or vegetables, even many fruits. I would love to like all of that, to have normal eating habits and not ashame myself in front of everyone when they find about what I like/dislike (it always turns into an interrogatory of \"do you like X?\" \"do you like Y?\" \"not even Z???\" which I absolutely hate). But I just can't.\\n\\nAccording to my doctor, as long as I'm physically healthy all of this is not an issue, \"just a quirk\". A therapist I went to a few years ago kinda said the same thing and never touched the topic again. According to my family and friends, and well basically everyone I've talked to about this, \"it's as simple as trying more food!\", but they don't understand that that's exactly what I have issues with!! And it being so simple makes me feel very bad about myself for failing to do something that apparently is so easy.\\n\\nI don't know if this is an eating disorder, or if I'm just a picky eater and that's it. Everything I've found online is directed to little kids, which means that this is probably not too common with adults. I have certainly never met anyone like me. \\n\\nI don't know either whether I should go to a therapist, a psychiatrist, a nutritionist or a dietist to get help. Or all of them. I'm not looking for advice on how to improve with this post, I just want to know what's going on with me. I've never had any kind of support, empathy or understanding about this topic in my life, only shame and comfrontation, so I'd like to know if it's really something I should feel bad about or if it's an actual disorder that I have.   \n",

It’s impressive how they can make amazing, filling and even healthy meals when they intentionally buy cheap ingredients and make them last.\\n\\nIt also made me sad to think… I probably spend a lot more than that only to not get as much in return, because I buy hippie low calorie foods. I’m sorry, I wholeheartedly enjoy my crispy cauliflower crunch snacks which are $5 per 1 serving bag. Heck, even a small container of  blackberries is $5.   \n",

I was just at this restaurant and everything on the menu had the calories in it listed by the name. This isn’t super common where I live. Personally I think it makes it more accessible for me because I don’t have to worry about trying to figure out and guesstimating and overestimating because of that. It basically helps me be more comfortable in what I order because I can track it. That being said I’m not in recovery so I can’t really understand that perspective. Overall though do you think it should be allowed or commonplace?   \n",

I would be okay staying the weight I am now, maybe get more toned, but I'm okay with my current weight. BUT if I eat anything remotely \"normal\" or delicious, I *will* end up losing control and going down the BED road. Again. So, no recovery for me. And because I don't trust myself with anything close to TDEE, I guess I'll keep losing for now, even though that's not my end goal. Idk if that even makes sense.   \n",

This is mainly in regards to socially eating. So I have a group of friends that are foodies and basically want to go out to eat a lot. I love hanging out with them, but every time I hang out with them, the event revolves around food or going to a restaurant. Every time I go and eat with them, I feel immense guilt and self-hatred afterwards. Even if the food is super good, I still hate myself afterwards. My closest friend in that group has reassured me that it will be okay if I have a day where I eat good food. She has even said that life is too short for bad food. I want to feel empowered by that, but I just can’t. When I eat food at a restaurant, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wrong and disgusting. I feel like I’m going to go back to my old ways and I’m just super negative in my head after I go out to eat with them. Also I feel like if I go and say no to food, people are going to ask me why and I just don’t feel like telling them a whole story. I love hanging out with them, but I don’t know what to do to resolve my bad emotions.</td>\n",

I guess to be frank, I relapsed into a binge cycle for the first in a long time.  \\n\\n\\nI used to binge as a teenager to deal with my emotions, and I stopped for a long time. I don't... Know how I did? I just, realized I didn't need to eat to feel better and it was making me feel worse. I suffered with a stint with ana for a while and I started recovery for a while, relapsed, and went into a stint of recovery again and now I'm finding myself binging on and off and I don't. Know what to do. I'm absolutely scared, ashamed... I don't know what is even going on. I know that I'm really depressed, but I didn't turn to food like this for years. I'm genuinely scared.  \\n\\n\\nI started my day normally, I ate like normal. I wasn't overeating the day prior, I didn't feel like I was undereating- I walked and worked out like normal but today I woke up, went for my walk, and came home. I ate my normal breakfast, walked around, but started getting anxious and feeling on edge. I took a nap to let the feeling pass but it caused me to skip my work out at my regular time. I woke up, went to get some water and was feeling depressed by then. Next thing I know, I'm digging into cookie dough, having consumed a vast amount of lemonade, bagels, cookies, peanut butter, and wings. I don't even like these foods! I don't even like peanut butter or cookie dough. I wasn't even hungry! It was just, a mix of emotions and I've been doing this on and off for the last couple of days. I'll reset my day, and go back to how things are before the binge and then I'll binge again. I... Hate to say this but I even ate something that I tried to toss. I don't need to eat less, or with more volume-I just don't understand why I need to do this emotionally or why I can't stop. I don't like this. I don't even like binging. It doesn't make me feel better yet I'm just stuck... I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't a place to put this and I'm anxious posting here. I really don't like it, and I know it's a common struggle and I'm not alone... But no one in my family has the same issues. I used to be so put together and I fell off the track so hard. I want to get back on but when I do, I fall off again. It's a cycle. I try not to restrict to make up for it, I stopped overexercising because I thought I binged out of hunger- I would weightlift for context and underfuel, sent my body into starvation mode.  \\n\\n\\nI want to stop using food to cope and stop putting my depression on the front so I can get on with my life. I have a therapist but she's not specialized with eds and my insurance is backed up. I started Prozac but that's not going to kick in for a while and it might not be enough.

She had a baby last year and per her mom, it really bothers her if people call her baby chunky or chubby or comment on baby’s fat leg rolls. Also she took like one photo of herself while pregnant. \\nNow I’m not in the ED community or anything similar so I DO NOT want to upset or offend anyone but I just think this is ludicrous. I personally loved seeing pix of my mother glowing and pregnant with me. And babies ARE beautifully wonderfully perfectly chubby! \\nI just don’t understand at all but I’m not gonna say this to her. Just wondering if this is typical?\\nAgain I’m sorry if my thoughts on this upset you - that’s not my intention.   \n",

I’m proud of the progress I have made, but I’m still going through some mental anguish. This is mainly in regards to socially eating. So I have a group of friends that are foodies and basically want to go out to eat a lot. I love hanging out with them, but every time I hang out with them, the event revolves around food or going to a restaurant. Every time I go and eat with them, I feel immense guilt and self-hatred afterwards. Even if the food is super good, I still hate myself afterwards. My closest friend in that group has reassured me that it will be okay if I have a day where I eat good food. She has even said that life is too short for bad food. I want to feel empowered by that, but I just can’t. When I eat food at a restaurant, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wrong and disgusting. I feel like I’m going to go back to my old ways and I’m just super negative in my head after I go out to eat with them. Also I feel like if I go and say no to food, people are going to ask me why and I just don’t feel like telling them a whole story. I love hanging out with them, but I don’t know what to do to resolve my bad emotions.   \n",

Like the title says, I'm about to start a job in an inpatient ED clinic (I'm currently working in the same psych hospital so I'm familiar with inpatient treatment but not the ED unit in particular).  I don't have much personal experience with eating disorders but obviously I want to not screw this up.  I was wondering if any of you lovely people who have had experience with inpatient treatment (or other intensive treatment) have any tips/advice?  As in, was there anything particularly helpful or therapeutic for you (or not helpful, that you wish staff had done differently)?  No pressure to answer this of course, but any insight is appreciated :)   \n",

       "24080  First time posting, but I think this is the best place to put here. I guess to be frank, I relapsed into a binge cycle for the first in a long time.  \\n\\n\\nI used to binge as a teenager to deal with my emotions, and I stopped for a long time. I don't... Know how I did? I just, realized I didn't need to eat to feel better and it was making me feel worse. I suffered with a stint with ana for a while and I started recovery for a while, relapsed, and went into a stint of recovery again and now I'm finding myself binging on and off and I don't. Know what to do. I'm absolutely scared, ashamed... I don't know what is even going on. I know that I'm really depressed, but I didn't turn to food like this for years. I'm genuinely scared.  \\n\\n\\nI started my day normally, I ate like normal. I wasn't overeating the day prior, I didn't feel like I was undereating- I walked and worked out like normal but today I woke up, went for my walk, and came home. I ate my normal breakfast, walked around, but started getting anxious and feeling on edge. I took a nap to let the feeling pass but it caused me to skip my work out at my regular time. I woke up, went to get some water and was feeling depressed by then. Next thing I know, I'm digging into cookie dough, having consumed a vast amount of lemonade, bagels, cookies, peanut butter, and wings. I don't even like these foods! I don't even like peanut butter or cookie dough. I wasn't even hungry! It was just, a mix of emotions and I've been doing this on and off for the last couple of days. I'll reset my day, and go back to how things are before the binge and then I'll binge again. I... Hate to say this but I even ate something that I tried to toss. I don't need to eat less, or with more volume-I just don't understand why I need to do this emotionally or why I can't stop. I don't like this. I don't even like binging. It doesn't make me feel better yet I'm just stuck... I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if this isn't a place to put this and I'm anxious posting here. I really don't like it, and I know it's a common struggle and I'm not alone... But no one in my family has the same issues. I used to be so put together and I fell off the track so hard. I want to get back on but when I do, I fall off again. It's a cycle. I try not to restrict to make up for it, I stopped overexercising because I thought I binged out of hunger- I would weightlift for context and underfuel, sent my body into starvation mode.  \\n\\n\\nI want to stop using food to cope and stop putting my depression on the front so I can get on with my life. I have a therapist but she's not specialized with eds and my insurance is backed up. I started Prozac but that's not going to kick in for a while and it might not be enough. Does anyone have tips or advice on how they were able to break out?   \n",

Does allowing yourself to eat without limits mean you don’t care about what you eat anymore or is it just binging but without caring about the calories. Ive gained and lost 10-20kg 3 times in the past 3 years and rn im at the point where I stopped caring what I eat simply bc i don’t have time. But i still care sometimes. Can you be burned out from trying to restrict yourself? Am I gaining weight bc of binging or is it bc i stopped estimating my calorie intake? Am I losing weight bc I stopped binging or is it bc im restricting? How can you know. What exactly is the goal when recovering? I never know. I feel better when I lose weight bc of how ppl treat me but eating without guilt is also great. Why is it so hard to be satisfied. If i just didnt binge so much after i lost weight I wouldn’t be so anxious in public. But what now? Im so tired of caring   \n",

I'm a 19 y.o trans woman and I'm super worried I have binge eating disorder. I'll binge at least twice in a day and it's usually a lot of food. I'm wondering if others eat as much as I do or if I just have a big appetite.\\n\\nUsually in the day, I'll binge in daylight where I'll go to a shop and buy a big bag of crisps and a something sweet like chocolate or donuts, usually enough for a group of people, I'll also get a sweet drink like fanra or coke, sometimes 2 later bottles. Then I'll binge again after it gets dark by raiding my cupboards. I'll Usually have 3 or 4 small bags of crisps, and something extra like chocolate, or meat from the fridge, or more recently cheese. This is ignoring dinner, which most of the time is a small ready meal.\\n\\nI know this is bad, I'm just worried that this is BED and not just a lack of discipline. I do eat as a coping method for stress. I'm wondering if this is similar to others experiences.   \n",

Enjoy it!” But I know I’m eating out of pure boredom. I’m not sick. I’m not tired. I have time to make healthy meals. I have the means to buy here they food. I’m just on a binge episode and I can’t get off. I just keep eating before every task. About to go upstairs to change the laundry? Let me grab some chips. About to get in the car? A handful of M&amp;Ms. Before the shower? A few chocolate covered raising. Before walking the dog ? An animal cookie. It’s so stupid. It’s not pregnancy cravings.   \n",

I don't know. But for me bingeing is the reward, purging or restricting was punishment. So I've worked on that A lot. I'm definitely not seeing it as a reward but I miss that connection with food if that makes sense. Right now I'm reward craving so badly but have nothing to fill that crave, any advice?   \n",
