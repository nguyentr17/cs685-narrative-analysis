i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you. I don't like the idea of veganism or cannibalism.

84,1.0,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone, over the last 3 years I have struggled pretty heavily with food. I'm gonna summarize what's happened so far, and will put my question after this paragraph if you want to skip.

I used to be very very obese, and I decided to start slowly eating better. I also started fasting. A few months into this, I went to the doctor, and got some scary blood work. An almost too high a1c. My lab numbers have always been bad, but the a1c sent me into a health anxiety tailspin. I kept cutting stuff out and eating less and less. I also slowly took on a keto diet. I also started regularly working out. I started to test my blood sugars all the time. I would even challenge myself by drinking a bunch of sugar water and testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours. My numbers were always normal. My fingers would be bruised all the time. Then, I started having some bad body symptoms. Basically a tremor. I freaked out and went to the doctor. Got a bunch of blood tests that showed malnutrition. I was asked about my caloric intake, and after thinking for a while I realized I was eating basically nothing. I started to bulk up my meals with low carb stuff: cheese, veggies, nuts, meat, and felt a lot better. Still tested my sugars whenever I ate carbs. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm close to a healthy weight now, all my numbers are pretty great, except my cholesterol is a touch high, but not as high as it was when I was heavy.

Well, now I'm concerned about my low carb diet, and I want to move toward a more balanced, healthy one. I'm terrified, because carbs equal blood sugar testing for me, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time. My concern is, could this just be an evolution of my disordered eating? Being so concerned with healthy foods that it's just bringing me out of a low carb diet and into a Mediterranean one? I'm so exhausted. This takes up most of my thoughts every day.

I‚Äôve made it a point to be very careful about my ‚Äúhabits‚Äù and I‚Äôve always tried to be the body positive, you deserve a treat, eat when your body tells you to, type of person toward other people. About a month ago, I had a breakdown after triggering myself. I broke down to a roommate who has ventured into this territory with me before in front of another roommate who absolutely has not. He‚Äôs a safe person to talk to about things like this but I *knew* she had been struggling with recent weight gain. I wasn‚Äôt thinking clearly and it didn‚Äôt cross my mind until after. I said some really nasty things about myself, my weight, and the way I eat. 

Since then, she‚Äôs been struggling with her weight a lot more. I can see the sadness and dread anytime food is brought up, she‚Äôs limiting herself in a way that can lead to restriction quickly, she‚Äôs started using very negative language to describe her body, etc. I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôs joining the community anytime soon, but the fact that I made someone feel badly about themselves and I can see them going through the same things I went through when all this started makes me feel like shit. 

I can tell myself that I‚Äôve been careful, that my body positive quotes and food positive ‚Äúmindset‚Äù have ensured I haven‚Äôt triggered anyone. But let‚Äôs be real. She‚Äôs not the first person I‚Äôve triggered, she‚Äôs just the first person I‚Äôve been around after triggering them. I can‚Äôt live like this and honestly believe nobody else has been effected. Maybe I‚Äôm not going around calling people fat or spreading Pro bullshit, but the things that triggered me all those years ago were subtle too. It‚Äôs a comment here, a remark there and before you know it, you‚Äôve spent over 15 years hating yourself. 

I don‚Äôt want to trigger people. I don‚Äôt want every moment of my life to be dictated by how much I eat or how small I am. I don‚Äôt want to be winded walking across the house or feel happy when my body shows signs of suffering. I want to eat when my body is hungry and have little treats. I want to love my body the way I try to convince others to love theirs. I want to be healthy and maybe even strong. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to get there. The thought is terrifying and I‚Äôve made half ass attempts at ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù before, but this time feels different. 

I‚Äôm going to sit down with my safe roommate tonight and talk to him about everything. I think having someone who knows what I‚Äôm trying to do will be helpful. Maybe he can help me figure out some healthy goals as well. As much as I don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôm going to leave these subs. I know a lot of content is recovery based, but I‚Äôve been able to avoid that so far and I‚Äôm not going to pretend I can do better about it now. If anyone has suggestions for safe recovery subs to join, I‚Äôm all ‚Äúears‚Äù.

8301,1.0,EDAnonymous,"So far my eating disorder has consisted so much of punishments. Cold showers if you eat more than X. No rest days if you don't hit Y on the scale. No going out if you eat Z. I'm trying to ditch that, and I want to make recovery about rewarding myself for eating in *moderation*. Not binging, not restricting. However, I have a dilemma that makes finding a suitable reward feel impossible.

Growing up (and one of the leading reasons I developed BED) I had a parent who let life revolve around food. Namely, they would use food as a reward or let it coincide with any good experience. They were emotionally absent, but replaced love with food. Got all A's on a report card? Let's get ice cream. Got lead in the school play? That deserves a dinner out. It's a big holiday? Let's go splurge at the grocery store. Free time? Let's watch cooking shows and find a new recipe to make. I was often encouraged to eat more than I wanted and was told indirectly that my consuming the food I was given was the equivalent of accepting their love. So, I'm extremely ashamed to say that when I think of rewarding myself I think of food, but that just perpetuates the disorder. ""If I don't binge for 2 weeks, I'll buy myself a taro boba tea (I love those things)"", but that means restricting myself from that food for two weeks and putting it on a pedestal, othering it from the foods I normally eat, which is bound to create emotions good or bad surrounding it. 

But, that's not all! Both of my parents had a severe hoarding problem. And the one up above: When not using food to ""give"" love, they used material goods. They are pretty well off and would shower me with gifts in lieu of their presence and emotional energy. If I was ever depressed or suicidal, when not taking me out to eat, they preferred to take me on shopping sprees, buy me new toys, throw me some new clothes, than actually talk to me about what was going on. It's the main reason why my love languages are a blend of a bit of everything except gift-giving. Receiving physical gifts from people generally makes me feel sick and anxious. Seeing as I had a lot of siblings, and all these attempts at replacing emotional presence for us added up, our house ended up filthy, packed to the brim with evidence of their attempt to override emotional absence. I am not minimalist by any means, but buying things makes me feel anxious and bad. I do not like cluttering my living space and will even have panic attacks over buying new clothes or the like. That's why I prefer goods that can be ""used up"", and, unfortunately, the first thing that comes to mind is food.

By the end of this thought process, I feel like the best bet is to reward myself with an experience, but I don't know what. There isn't much I like to do that I don't do already. I like making music, writing, and hanging out with my friends, but that's pretty much it. The best I have is rewarding myself by spending money on entering a writing contest(?), but that's it.

Its much more consuming than just relapsing or just trying to recover. Whatever I do is inconsistent and I cant settle. 

One moment i want to just lose weight, lose everything to be recognised as sick and get help (not help for ed but the other stuff that gets worse when activly in ed)
Another I want to regain my physical health as much as possible to be able to fix myself on my own and to do the things i am not longer able to do.

Whenever i feel a flare coming i want to stop eating again as it doesnt matter if i starve or not ill always feel miserable
As soon as i feel a bit better i want to go all in and just fight for my health
Or i get so miserable that i bring myself to eat so i dont collaps completly
Then i get either guilty or feel hope that i could find the right way
After i had any success i feel like deserving nutrition
Or i starve out of self pity.
When i eat i cant decide if i feel proud of myself or feel like betraying myself.
Dietary changes are supposed to help with my physical illness wich is a great excuse.
When i feel better i fear dr. Will take me even less serious.
Being ill makes me so useless too, not being able to work or contribute orherwise so i am dont even deserving much food or good food becaue its not my money i need to spend for this.

I am in bed with migraine after puking from the headache and cant devide if ill take that excuse or get myself some food in hope to ease the pain. I wantet to go for a run and now i am angry.

9701,1.0,EDAnonymous,"I have been going strong in my relapse for a few months now. My low point was &gt;!700 !&lt;cals per day and that was quickly unsustainable. I work a lot and am studying for an exam next month. So, I have been using the holidays to slowly increase my cals. I was doing really well but getting obsessive about it and not paying attention to my nutrient intake. I was not consistent on taking supplements, if I even did. Also, I'm not the best with water intake, never have been. I don't like water. But I did force myself to drink at least two cups per day. Not enough. 

Needless to say, I traveled up North and was exposed to snow and a colder climate than I'm used to (I'm from Miami). I caught the common cold and got sick. It feels like my body used everything that was left in me and after I was getting over the cold, I fell into severe dehydration and iron deficiency. Guys, it was really scary. I thought I was going to die. It took me like four days to recover. I was too weak to even walk to my kitchen (I live in a studio) and at one point I felt like my brain was on static. 

I had to eat a lot of carbohydrates and then just hydrate on pedialytes and gatorade and ensures. That was the only thing that got me strong enough to a point where I was still dizzy all the time, but functional. 

I just wanted to warn all the ana babes out there. This was so scary, please, if you're going to continue on like this just watch your water and nutrient intake. Make sure you're getting potassium and iron. Make sure you're getting electrolytes and that you're drinking water. Milk is really good for hydration. It's a lot of calories, I know, but do like a glass a day at least. Drink ensure. Don't let it get as bad as it did for me. If you get sick, just take care of yourself. 

Vomiting in a parking lot from dehydration and hitting my head fainting on my bedroom floor after feeling like my brain was on static put a lot in perspective for me. Take care of yourself.

i‚Äôve had problems in the past w/ rapid weight loss when under severe stress coupled w/ a medication that impacts my appetite. i wouldn‚Äôt say i have the best relationship w/ food otherwise, but it‚Äôs hard to explain lol. i don‚Äôt think i technically meet ARFID criteria, i was told i had EDNOS many years ago (though i think that term may be outdated?). anyway a few months ago i was going through a little heartbreak/job stress and feel worlds better about the whole thing now, but fell back into old restrictive behaviors. my problems in the past have mainly resulted in feeling really tired and cold and a little hair loss.

i‚Äôve had a more difficult time regaining weight this time around, though my weight has been exactly as low as it was in the past and hasn‚Äôt dipped any lower. i asked my doc if changing my medication might help my appetite and HOLY SHIT it made a world of a difference. this was a week ago; for three days i couldn‚Äôt believe how much i enjoyed eating instead of dreading it.

yesterday i woke up w/ crazy body aches. i had been having weird visual distortions (dimming vision, phosphenes) and after my hand went numb (i have a slipped disc and realized after going into hysterics that may be the cause lol (numbness is riiiight in the area it‚Äôs supposed to be for where my disc is bulging) not sure if low weight maybe aggravated this as i haven‚Äôt had disc symptoms in years??) i decided to go to the ER just to make sure i didn‚Äôt inherit my family‚Äôs stroke-at-young-ages thing. they didn‚Äôt take my weight or comment on it and said i should follow up w/ an eye doctor but that it doesn‚Äôt sound urgent if it isn‚Äôt getting in the way of things (it isn‚Äôt). i woke up again w/ a little weird vision stuff and holy shit every bone in my body hurts.

anyway, all of this is to say i‚Äôm working on this and feel okay but‚Ä¶ i was just wondering if this happened to anyone else ever. my hair on my head seems to have been spare but one of my eyebrows is getting real patchy lol. i also haven‚Äôt been feeling as cold as i was a few years ago (even tho it was summer) but with temps dropping it got real bad for a couple days. all of this didn‚Äôt really throw me off, but the aches are wild and vision isn‚Äôt bothering me much but is throwing me off a bit. just wasn‚Äôt expecting this, esp after eating more the last few days? think i read somewhere that can actually cause the aches??

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you.

16883,1.0,AnorexiaNervosa,"My sister was diagnosed 6 months ago after constantly passing out/lost tons of weight, and she started IOP. She still hasn‚Äôt gained weight or her period back after thousands of dollars spent on her nutritionist/therapist/psychiatrist. She has been caught putting food in her pocket instead of eating it. We haven‚Äôt caught her throwing up yet but idk how she‚Äôs not gaining weight. I live out of town and my mom manages her treatment. I told my mom to tell my sister that she needs to see her poop and take a picture of it everyday for two weeks per the doctor (obviously a lie) so we could tell if she was throwing up/taking laxatives or if she had a large normal BM. Her toilet is spotless but it‚Äôs always been like that but I am wondering if she‚Äôs doing something more than hiding food. 

I need advice from someone who has recovered from anorexia. 

How do we make sure she eats all of her meal? (Sit with her during and supervise after the meal?) 

How should we check if she hides food in her pockets without triggering her? (Check pockets before/after, go to bathroom w her etc?? My parents work schedules cause her to eat one meal per day alone, which is prepped and ready for her to eat. 

Are physical checks and accountability during and after meals absolutely necessary for her recovery, or can we continue letting her eat alone?? And if it is necessary, how strict should the supervision be??

How should we check if she‚Äôs throwing up after meals without triggering her? (Go to bathroom w her for up to 1.5 hours post meal?)

How do we motivate her to try to gain weight? (Bring up the fact she can‚Äôt go off to college next year unless she gets better? Tell her a time limit she has to gain weight before sending her to inpatient care? Scare tactic?) 

She is a senior in high school but does school at home. She needs to get better but it seems like maybe she‚Äôs not trying or thinking ‚Äúthis is just the way I am.‚Äù How do we warn her that if she doesn‚Äôt gain weight, she will go to a facility without her phone and without super healthy vegetarian meals and without a loving family? How do we motivate her without shaming her? How do we discuss her lack of improvement while reminding her that we care, and motivate her to try harder at the same time?? Or do we not discuss the worse case scenario at all (going to inpatient care/not going to college next fall). All of these thought cross our minds but we don‚Äôt address her non-compliance too harshly because we don‚Äôt want her to spiral out of control. When she hides food and doesn‚Äôt eat it, we just ask if she wants to get better and encourage her to not hide food, but that kind caring approach (asking self reflective questions) clearly isn‚Äôt working. 

Will she have to hit rock bottom to get better? When did you realize you wanted to get better and when did you start trying to eat more?

17069,1.0,AnorexiaNervosa,"hello üëãüèª 

my name is jas. i‚Äôm 21 years old, and i am a trans man. 

*pre recovery TW ahead. skip if unable to read. your journey is important üíô*

i have been anorexic since i was 12. i was hospitalized inpatient at 14 and intubated for 12 weeks in 2015. that part of my journey happened when i was a minor in a hospital that also treated adults. it was not a healthy environment for recovery. 

*TW section end*

since that hospitalization, i have been terrified to seek ED treatment.

now, at age 21, i am struggling more than i ever have. 

due to financial struggles, it‚Äôs been difficult to even OBTAIN sufficient food to fill me and my partners pantry. 

my personal struggle is this: i went vegetarian at 12. it has nothing to do with the ED, it‚Äôs a moral and health reason. meat made me beyond nauseous so i decided to cut it out. i‚Äôm also lactose sensitive, so i avoid and limit dairy products so i can avoid frequent toilet trips, as my work schedule won‚Äôt accommodate my bowels. 

that being said, a few years ago while in therapy, we started sorting through some individual food or food group issues and i‚Äôm slowly working on my cheese aversion. i use almond or oat milk and i take vitamins and supplements daily. 

i don‚Äôt want to use numbers because i don‚Äôt want to trigger anybody who is on their own journey. but my weight is low and i am having a VERY difficult time maintaining, let alone gaining. and the symptoms of this horrible disease are starting to take away my quality of life. 

i want to start to at LEAST maintain. however, if i start to see a pound or two a week, i will not be devastated as i was as a teenager. 

my job makes it very difficult to sit down and eat three meals a day, and i don‚Äôt have much free time to meal prep. 

do any of you have suggestions for small, balanced ‚Äúmeals‚Äù or versatile snacky platters that don‚Äôt require much prep or heating? i‚Äôm slowly trying to work on actual MEAL prep on my own, but while i‚Äôm working on that, i‚Äôd like to try to bring little things along when i go out. 

i‚Äôm asking for advice whether you‚Äôre still ‚Äúin it‚Äù (my prayers and positive wishes if you are) or if you‚Äôre recovering. i fear i‚Äôm so far ‚Äúin it‚Äù now that im losing the ability to control AN, and i don‚Äôt want it to win me. 

i‚Äôve been AN‚Äôs prisoner since i was a child. i have very little access to help or therapy now. i want to beat this beast. i want to be stronger than AN. 

any and all advice is appreciated. i honestly know very very little about food and health and balanced meals due to my restriction. i‚Äôm trying to learn on my own, but if anybody has ideas for quick grab and go, i would LOVE to hear them. 

stay strong, stay safe and keep fighting. you are loved, you are enough. keep living, keep breathing and keep your hearts beating. y‚Äôall are worth SO much more than this damn illness and the life it‚Äôs created for us. üñ§",,"AN reddit, please help",1,,recovery related,,,,t5_2ydy9,1035e8d,1,moonbunni24,,/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1035e8d/an_reddit_please_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1035e8d/an_reddit_please_help/,1672843677,549,1,0,0,1,1,9 years,no,writer,,21,trans man,,9 years,yes,writer,"['financial struggles', 'difficulty in obtaining sufficient food']",21,trans man,external,since 12,yes,writer,"due to financial struggles, it‚Äôs been difficult to even OBTAIN sufficient food to fill me and my partners pantry.",21,trans man,external

17604,1.0,AnorexiaNervosa,"When I was a teenager (around 10 years ago) I used to be really bad. Hospitalized bad. I then accepted my body over time for not being perfect but I was a healthy weight and I ate normally because I have other health conditions (epilepsy and RA and autism which all are affected by blood sugar) and I‚Äôm on so many pills a day I had to just get in the a habit of eating to not throw them up. 

I was doing so well. 

I moved out of my apartment after living in a very walking-friendly part of town to a place no one walks, and, i stay inside all day so naturally my weight went up because I wasn‚Äôt walking 30 min to school everyday and walking to my friends houses and to go get food and hand out. I never realized that when I stopped walking (especially I went into a coma and had to be in a wheelchair or walker for a while so very sedentary life style), even though for my conditions I should be doing minor exercise daily.

The big problem is I‚Äôve been stopping all the medications I can that I heard have caused weight gain for people and my doctors don‚Äôt want me to go off them and I didn‚Äôt even tell them! I‚Äôm going to have to deal with that but all I can think about is the scale. But I was forced to go back on them by my own body‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt pretty..

18593,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"TW: mentions of diets, eating behaviours, swearing.

So I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn‚Äôt even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don‚Äôt know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don‚Äôt think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in ‚Äúsafer‚Äù and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: ‚Äúyeah well most people don‚Äôt know how to respond to eating disorders‚Äù / ‚Äúthey were just trying to help‚Äù and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn‚Äôt even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification. 

I often read on the internet that ‚Äòdiet culture is everywhere‚Äô and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn‚Äôt even ‚ÄúEAT THAT MUCH‚Äù is NOT the right answer either. 

Society and media have made it ‚Äònormal‚Äô and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one‚Äôs food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one‚Äôs self to look like someone they are not. 

Well, I don‚Äôt know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I‚Äôll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‚ÄòINTERMITTENT FASTING‚Äô (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL. 

You wanna know what‚Äôs normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‚ÄòHEALTHY‚Äô. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively. 

Your body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.

And for all those people who thought they were helping but were just reflecting back my insecurities and diet culture: FUCK YOU. Fuck you. Fuck you. And I‚Äôm sorry you are so fucking blind you literally perpetuated deadly shit on someone because you thought you were helping. This is just about how dangerous diet culture is.

19246,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"I‚Äôm currently trying to gain weight, and so I should be eating at a surplus, but you guys know how it is.  

Some days the urge to restrict kicks in strong, or I don‚Äôt have a lot of energy to make food. 

It‚Äôs been helpful to be eating more than maintenance, because on really bad days I can satisfy the urge to restrict by just cutting down a little bit and ending up at maintenance!  

I‚Äôm on my third month of my first ever TRUE recovery attempt and that mindset has helped me so much. 

I‚Äôm not tracking calories but I still have that stupid calculator in my head that does its math in the background when I‚Äôm not paying attention, so that‚Äôs been a hurdle to get over. 

But according to that stupid calculator, I think I‚Äôve only had one day in the past two months where I ate below maintenance!!  

This is the longest streak of eating enough every day (and not binging thousands of calories intermittently) that I have had in FOUR YEARS!! 

It‚Äôs insane to be finally exiting the cycle of binging and restricting, and losing and gaining the same xx pounds every other month. 

My last relapse I hit my lowest ever weight, even lower than 4 years ago when I first fell into anorexia. 

I knew I was going to end up in the hospital if I didn‚Äôt stop and get my illness under control, if not then, then sometime in the future. I‚Äôm fairly certain I‚Äôve severely damaged my heart at this point, and will be trying to get to a cardiologist soon. I can only hope that I‚Äôm not too late to reverse the damage I‚Äôve already done to my body. 

My home environment is incredibly chaotic and tense, and I‚Äôm learning to take care of myself and be good to my body, no matter how much stress I‚Äôm under or who I‚Äôm with. 

And no more putting a relapse on the back burner! I‚Äôm dedicating myself wholly to this and will not allow restriction to be a fallback when I am stressed or in a lot of emotional pain. 

It‚Äôs a journey!!! I‚Äôm so happy to be on it!! 

Ty for reading if you did, I have so much to say about the amazing things I‚Äôm learning, and all the strange things about recovery and my mindset, so I may continue to post here and talk about it with y‚Äôall.

19509,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"tl;dr it's a rollercoaster, but I thought if someone could use some insight, I should post maybe?

I started recovery around 6 months ago, but relapsed after 3 weeks, and then came back to it in late October. What made me come back to recovery, was when my best friends sat down with me, and told me they didn't think they could sit down and watch me die anymore, and that it was becoming too much for them. So on the day they told me that, I started actual recovery.

I had extreme hunger for a few weeks, and still sometimes now. I didn't run nor exercise beforehand, and so after a month, my aunt offered me to go to the gym with her. I also started craving a bunch of meats, so I naturally ate a bunch of protein out of nowhere. I started gaining muscle, and I can see I have gained so much muscle back, and yes, I also gained weight along with all this. The weight gain came super fast sometimes, and then would slow down, then go back to fast, then slow down. It's still kind of like that, but now it's up and down, but I honestly don't even weigh myself as often anymore, because it's starting to become irrelevant (VERY SLOWLY). My extreme hunger varies, I still have it on certain days of the week, and certain days it's ALMOST normal, until it hits a certain time sometimes. I will say, to people worried about huge amounts of weight gain very fast, I gained super fast within a week, and I had a massive anxiety attack, almost relapsed. In my experience, that weight isn't real weight, and it's just your body processing it.

Honestly, I have had really tough moments, but I feel so much better and stronger now. I thought going to the gym would make me relapse, or restrict, but I ate even more because I felt more hungry, and I didn't feel bad. I don't feel lightheaded anymore, I can eat out, and I can be happy with my friends again, without feeling like they're worried about me. My advice, is be patient, and don't let yourself scare the living hell out of your recovery. I still have a long way to go, but I thought I would share my experience so far.

19516,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"Tomorrow is my one year since I committed to recovery! I have had some relapses along the way, but I have been steadily in recovery now for about the past 6 months. 

You can see the tattoo in my post history, it‚Äôs the most recent post. It says, ‚Äúbeyond fear lies freedom‚Äù. 

Getting this tattoo has helped me further commit to recovery. I know now that if relapse again I will feel like a complete fraud with this tattoo on my arm. I know I will inevitably face challenges and likely more disordered eating, but this tattoo reminds me that I never want to get as bad as I did. 

This tattoo isn‚Äôt just for my recovery from anorexia but everything that has happened in my life in the past two years. Before I was robbed at gunpoint, thus developing severe PTSD, I was fearless in everything that I did. The robbery completely took that away from me. Then I discovered my boyfriend at the time was a porn addict that was exclusively attracted to underage girls, which made my anorexia so much worse since I always compared myself to underdeveloped 12 year old girls. Our relationship was so toxic and it instilled so much fear in me in so many aspects. 

One year since we broke up and since I decided to commit to recovery, and I can say I actually feel somewhat okay for first time in years now. 

I‚Äôve been through hell and back and I never thought that reaching the place I have in recovery would be possible. But it was, and I am thankful. I am thankful that I let go of him. I am thankful we separated. I am thankful I chose to recover. If I didn‚Äôt, I would have been dead by March of last year.

19655,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"Hi there. I believe in you, okay? It‚Äôs hard. Really hard. But you‚Äôll get through it. Someone told me that recovery feels like each meal after the next. It gets repetitive, it gets boring, it gets painful, but ultimately... it gets better. 

What has helped me the absolute most is to find things that comfort me whether it‚Äôs after meals, at random times, when I‚Äôm happy or when I‚Äôm sad. These are things like baths, showers, heating pads, a warm comfy bed and snuggling with stuffed animals. 

Some of the other things I like to do are read, learn something new (I love psychology/neuroscience/science), or draw. 

I‚Äôm telling you this list of things to let you know comfort for you can be absolutely anything. And honestly, there are quite a few times that I‚Äôve found comfort in food even though there are times where I struggle as well. However, it is time for you to experiment. Find what brings you comfort. 

Another thing that has helped me is creating a positive attachment to food. I fucking love peanut butter. I will eat that shit TO THE DAY I DIE. I could probably have it at every meal for a month and still want it (ok well maybe i‚Äôd have to have some variance of nut butters) BUT STILL. I love it. And honestly, like if i‚Äôm craving a huge ass pita slathered with peanut butter and bananas I EAT THAT SHIT bc it makes me happy. In any way possible, I try to make eating fun and enjoyable. For example, I tried cooking.. for like the first time today. I made chicken alfredo. ME BEFORE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE BOTCH UR GONNA GET DIABETES but it‚Äôs delicious as fuck so who gives a shit. 

Okay that was a pretty big tangent but all and all, recovery is fucking hard. Physically, emotionally, mentally. And if you add in some little comfort activities sprinkled in your day, it makes things a bit better. 

You may feel lost, alone, depressed, obsessed and thousands of other things. But you aren‚Äôt alone. Personally, not eating enough triggered a major depressive episode for me and I can guarantee you although life sucks and I feel like a piece of shit sometimes I am a WHOLE lot happier after eating a shit ton of food and gaining weight. (and reaching out for help) My body needs the calories to process the stress of life so I can be happy, and so does yours. If your body does not have enough energy it stops a lot of processes such as your digestion, your heart, your growth, and YOUR MIND. If your body doesn‚Äôt have enough energy to process food, how is it going to have enough energy to be happy, to laugh, to create, and to thrive. 

To choose recovery is to choose to be your very best self. And that is in getting through your meal, and the next one. And the one after that. I know it sucks but choose recovery in being kind to yourself, and the greatest thing you can do for your body is nourish it.

20174,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"I think some people are just need to be a higher weight than others to be healthy. No I dont meant it's bc they have more muscle, they have larger bones, bla bla. I meant they literally need to be fatter, they literally need to be a higher bf%, to be healthy. I dont care anymore if some 15 year old named suzie think that's fat logic.   
 

A little backstory- in puberty, i was always the teen version of a lower but healthy bmi (teenagers dont use bmi, they use percentile, but you get what i mean). I was always in the ""acceptable"" range at school physicals. I never tripped any alarms. I was as skinny as most other students. But I was the one who, in order to maintain that weight, was passing out twice a month, not them. I was the one having a snack as my lunch, skipping my periods here and there, failing to grow in height or chest size. Not them.   
 

It doesn't help that my sister in her teenage years could be literally off-the-charts underweight and still show no signs of disordered eating, still have a fully functional life, never pass out, no medical issues, always getting her period, etc. My mom loved talking about how she was a similar weight as a teenager, and spoke of my sister taking after her like a point of pride.   
 

I felt like even more of a failure bc I have very tiny bones and almost no muscle so I never felt like I could blame bone or muscle for my failure to be naturally skinny.   
 

Anyway, very unsurprisingly, I eventually lapsed into a full-blown ED. When I hit my LW, I started mysteriously gaining on very few cals a day. I had triggered FHA. Even my endo noted that it was an uncommon condition. I once again compared myself- why could so many people be so much skinnier without triggering FHA? I actually lost weight very slowly and relatively little of it, so why me?   
 

I started weight restoration. I was partially weight restored when I stopped that in its tracks. I had reached a bmi that most young people here have. But it just wasn't meant to be. I still needed to constantly use ED behaviours to maintain that weight. I was still mentally a wreck and obsessed with food. I felt like a crazy person stuck in a normal person's body, which felt more confusing than a crazy person stuck in an anorexic body.   
 

Yesterday, I had a realization- if I needed to constantly pass out and stunt my own growth to be normal-slim as a teenager, maybe it just isnt meant to be.   
 

It helps me to think of being naturally skinny like being naturally good at basketball. Some people are just not meant for it. It makes no sense for a 5 foot tall person to aim for the NBA and be constantly envious of natural talents.   
 

Today I stopped all ED habits. I just ate intuitively. I know I will gain weight but I'm reminding myself of the basketball analogy. I feel bad when I see so many naturally skinny people on the streets and know I can't be one of them, but I remind myself that I am good at other things. Because today, I could finally focus on pursuits I was always good at without struggling to put my food obsession in the backdrop. There are more meaningful things to have a knack for than being skinny anyway.",,"Screw it, I don't care if it's fat logic, I think some people are just not ""naturally skinny"" and not meant to maintain the minimum healthy bmi and I'm one of them",61,,recovery story,,,,t5_o3plh,iostjw,1,PM_ME_UR_DECOY_SNAIL,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/iostjw/screw_it_i_dont_care_if_its_fat_logic_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/iostjw/screw_it_i_dont_care_if_its_fat_logic_i_think/,1599568872,589,1,0,0,1,1,,no,writer,,teenage years,,,,no,writer,,teenager,female,,,no,writer,,teenager,female,

I wanted to say, the main reason I never wanted to gain, even though people would always tell me ‚Äúyou looked so good when you weighed more‚Äù. I always thought my friends wouldn‚Äôt like me as much if I wasn‚Äôt this skinny fragile person. Of course it‚Äôs your eating disorder saying this to you, convincing you the whole world revolves around liking you for being this way, or might be something similar. 

I know everyone always says to just ‚Äúignore the thoughts‚Äù. It‚Äôs not easy, it‚Äôs a constant war waging in your head, all the time. I never have liked my body, never.

20398,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,"I have been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia for years now. I‚Äôm 22 and the intrusive thoughts started when I was 11. It has sucked so badly and I‚Äôve cried multiple times a week over the fact that I have hated my body and could never just exist as I am. It has always felt like Ana has been in the back of my head just screaming at me to stop eating. Stop eating. Stop EATING. 

A few weeks ago I hit a dark place I‚Äôve never been at before. 

TW for self harm and ED talk 

I‚Äôm not sure if you remember, but a few weeks ago I posted about how I woke up to find stretch marks on my stomach. They had appeared over night and I‚Äôve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life. 

I relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself. 

And then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me. 

I was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work. 

Ever since then, things have been turning around. I‚Äôve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it‚Äôs much easier to dismiss. I‚Äôve also been doing physical activities (hiking, long walks), but for pleasure, and not as a means of punishing myself and/or trying to lose weight. I can look at myself naked and not cry. I feel good. 

Ana is still there, but she isn‚Äôt screaming anymore. She speaks more in a whisper, faintly hoping she can catch me in a bad moment. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, not every second is perfect and she still gets to me sometimes, but she no longer occupies my every waking moment. 

I am by NO MEANS advocating for self harm or any form of self destruction as a means of achieving clarity and relief. This was an uncontrollable action that resulted from a deep place of self loathing and an inconsolable longing for an end to the pain. Please do not do this in the hopes of it changing your mindset. 

This is what happened to me. My stomach is healing now and life is looking up. I‚Äôm now dedicated to self betterment instead of oppressive destruction of my body. I‚Äôm no longer listening to Ana and her restrictive deadlines. Slow and steady physical betterment for the sake of improved health, energy, and wellbeing is what I strive for now.

My disordered eating started when I was young - about eight years old. My earliest memory of purging was at ten. I ate because it made me feel good. I didn‚Äôt have many friends and I always felt as though I was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. I was a bit chubbier than the other kids and I was severely bullied. I had some behavioural challenges, too.

Navigating this as a child was extremely unfortunate and I have a lot of trauma from it.

When I started going through puberty (eleven years old) that‚Äôs when my body started to mature, I was more in proportion and people at school took more notice of me and wanted to be friends with me. This felt so nice after so long of being outcasted and insecure.

This is where I entered hell. I became so image focussed and food obsessed. I was restrictive for a year and I was skeletal at 12 - 13. I stopped getting my period, I had chunks of time lost (some type of weird amnesia?) and I had episodes of fainting.

I couldn‚Äôt hack it, restricting just became bingeing and purging. I got my period back maybe after 6 months and I gained weight. This was the hardest part. It wasn‚Äôt significant but I was so depressed that I wasn‚Äôt losing weight.

Cue early introduction to alcohol, cigarettes and boys‚Ä¶

I was on a slippery slope until I was about 17. Absolutely nobody or anything could help. No treatment, no intervention. Anything that could have potentially helped me, didn‚Äôt. The eating disorder held too much power over me and was apart of my identity.

One day - I realised it was up to me. I acknowledged that I was going to gain more weight, my body needed to heal, I am going to be uncomfortable but I am going to do this.

Yeah it was hard - it felt like what I imagine an addict would when going cold turkey.

My eating disorder shows up everyday to say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm still here?‚Äù Yes, after all this time. But the power you will have over it is more satisfying than bingeing and purging. This happens over TIME.

It is a one day at a time sort of thing. Sit with the urge and think about your thought process in that moment. Do you need dopamine or are you actually hungry?

Self awareness is important.

You also need to understand that for almost nearly all of us, we are looking for a temporary solution that takes us away from our pain. What is our pain? Where did this pain come from and what‚Äôs an alternative that is going to productively help us?


The reality is that nobody actually cares about how much you weigh. I had a baby 5 months ago, I‚Äôm 163cm and 85kg. I was 102kg before birth and 77kg before pregnancy. Why do I know this? I looked back on my pregnancy record. Was I triggered by this? Absolutely. I weighed myself recently though to see how I was bouncing back. Haven‚Äôt for a few weeks. Why not? I can‚Äôt be bothered.

I was also diagnosed with ADHD while I was pregnant. In hindsight it explains so much - my brain doesn‚Äôt produce enough dopamine essentially. What do I do? I‚Äôm always in search of something to make me feel good. I‚Äôm on medication (now) but that doesn‚Äôt take away any part of the pain or suffering.

Nothing helps. 

Just about any gimmick, legitimate treatment, or lifestyle change you can make; I've tried it.

It's so exhausting to eat healthy but balanced and exercise some but not too much and take the stairs instead of the elevator and meditate and go to therapy  day in and day out only to wake up in a pile of chip bags and candy wrappers-- again.",,"it keeps getting worse. nothing seems to help, after 8 years I'm so tired of playing this game",1,,:snoo_feelsbadman: just venting,,,,t5_2tmc8,zngk7x,1,foxescanflyvu,,/r/bulimia/comments/zngk7x/it_keeps_getting_worse_nothing_seems_to_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/zngk7x/it_keeps_getting_worse_nothing_seems_to_help/,1671202664,101,0,0,0,-1,1,,no,writer,,,,,,no,writer,,,,,,no,writer,,,,
22829,1.0,bulimia,"I've had an ED (predominantly bulimia) for about 14 years now. I've been in recovery for a couple years and my ED is what I would call passive a lot of the time, it's kinda lurking in my mind but it's not really in control of my life. Though when it does pop up I feel like I go through it in stages and for the most part I can somewhat predict what's gonna come next. 

Stage 1 : I've gained weight and it bothers me tremendously. I refuse to be in photos, avoid mirrors and dissappear off social media. I pick myself apart to the extreme, both on looks and personality. 

Stage 2 : I try to find ways to lose weight in a moderate manner, do it in a healthy way. I'll probably eat a bit less or try eating less meat and drink more water. I'll lose a little bit of weight slowly. 

Stage 3 : for some reason (period/normal fluctuations etc) I'll gain like 200 grams back and I will feel like a complete failure and like obviously I need to be doing something more drastic, or even better, I should just go throw up. I should probably fast 20 hours a day and go run 5 days a week and do keto. Why am I such a loser? Why can't I just fucking do anything right? Its not that hard. Jesus Christ. 

Stage 4 : I went all in and I'm now doing some crazy thing like 1000 calorie keto or the carnivore diet with running every day and 16 hour fasting, basically went from 0 to 100. I'm losing weight like its nothing and im feeling amazing cause I'm on that high!! Taking pictures all the time, im all over social media, making new friends.. life is great! Why didn't I do this sooner?? 

Stage 5 : took it too far! I'm sick with pneumonia or something and had to quit everything, realized I was starving and I binged. Why does this always happen?? I was so close to being healthy. No wonder my weight fluctuates like 40kg. This is insane. No more! I'm not doing this again. I have to recover.. if I don't do it now I'll never get better. I'll just eat normally and if I gain weight, so be it. 

Stage 6 : I eat normally and try my best to not think about it. I eat what I feel like. Keep it healthy but don't pass up a cookie. Generally pretty happy until I get back to stage 1",,Stages of my ED,12,,:snoo_hug: recovery :table:,,,,t5_2tmc8,piyut8,1,Pruts93,,/r/bulimia/comments/piyut8/stages_of_my_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/piyut8/stages_of_my_ed/,1630932773,430,0,0,0,-1,1,14 years,yes,writer,"['gained weight', 'negative self-image']",,female,internal,14 years,yes,writer,"['gained weight', 'failure in weight loss']",,,internal,14 years,yes,writer,"['gaining weight', 'feeling like a failure']",,,internal
