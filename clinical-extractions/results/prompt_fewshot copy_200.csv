"I saw something like this posted on another website but it was really old locked and thought it might be cool to start one here. Thought it might help people to identify and not feel so alone because I certainly feel that way right now. 

I'll start. 

You swing by Mcdonalds to get a snack thinking a few nuggets would be cool intending on only getting a 4 piece but instead end up ordering 60 nuggets and two large fries intending on sharing with the family. Before you know it you end up eating one of the fry packs and 50 of the nuggets on the car ride home. Ditch the evidence in a gas station trash can hoping no one saw you. 

You feel guilty at the grocery store like people are judging the contents of your cart. 

You have ever ate a whole pint of ice cream and whole package of mega stuffed oreos in one sitting even though you are lactose intolerant which fucked your gut up for at least a week afterwards. 

You have ever binged in your car because you didn't want anyone to see just how much you actually ate. 

You attempted to control a binge by binging on something healthy and high fiber (I made some low-carb/high fiber muffins) to curb your appetite figuring you won't eat too many of them before the fiber makes you too full. After eating all 24 muffins in one sitting you experience the weirdest form of solid diarrhea ever (sorry if tmi).  

Alternately you attempted to binge on apples and ended up eating at least a dozen of them before severe stomach cramps stopped you. Or a 2 pound bag of carrots. 

You have ever ate a whole cake in one sitting then tried to convince yourself at least it isn't taking up space in the fridge.

"hi,

thanks for making this space.

i was diagnosed w/ AN (b/p subtype) in 1997 as a teenager, solid in recovery since my mid 20's.  It's definitely been a battle. I've been in some form of therapy and/or medication every since my initial diagnosis.

i'm now 40 and having some relapses w/ purging lately, had a purging episode one night this last week.

I'd like to say that it's good to see Purging Disorder being recognised more often now.

It always was a huge part of my ED, both exercising and self induced vomiting.

There needs to be much more medical research done (and funding) about how to treat it.

"Sometimes I come to reddit to read about people's purging and restricting experiences bc I'm so tempted to fall back on old habits. I started going to a nutritionist last November and when I started going I was eating max 2 meals a day and purging routinely. But throughout this process it been so frustrating to find articles and stuff about people who restrict eating and purge. I feel like I am all alone. I hear about people who restrict and people who binge eat because that's what gets all the attention when talk about eating disorders. Given I can't even say disorder out loud, but it'd make me feel less alone if I could put myself into some category that wasn't as vague as 'disordered eating' or 'purging disorder' because I feel like the description of purging disorder j talks about purging and not restricting. Also when you read stuff about eating disorders online and talk to people about it nobody ever talks about how FLUID it is. Like I used to purge a lot a lot and then I tried to help myself by stopping and I just started restricting what I eat even more. IT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE!! Also recently I realized that my favorite part of drinking is coming home and throwing up because the best part about it is that I'm not 'purging' NO I'M PULLING TRIG its fun like what ever. But im beginning to realize that its really reflecting purging behavior because I won't have even drunk that much and I won't feel sick but I'll make myself do it anyways bc its kinda socially more acceptable than purging and I can convince myself that its not. And the worse part about it is that I've been telling my nutritionist that I haven't been purging bc I didn't count it right and I was really starting to feel like I was making a comeback but no I've been making myself throw up at least twice a month most months. I go to look online about correlations between drinking and purging disorder and I can't find any and it makes me feel so alone. Who am I supposed to talk to? I don't feel like I can talk to them bc I don't want to trigger them bc u never know what someones dealing with and the only people I know who like talk about their eating disorders are bulimic or anorexic and I know that this is all so personal and I don't want to trigger anyone. But rn it j feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm eating 3 meals a day but each ones a struggle. I can't even tell my parents how much I'm struggling bc im so embarrassed.

"I'm overweight because I love binge eating. But sometimes I hate that I binge eat so I purge. But sometimes I love purging so I don't even have to binge to do it. But then I hate that I'm purging so I restrict. But I can't restrict forever and I hate feeling full so I start restricting and purging. Except those days where I eat relatively normally, but now I have energy so I start exercising. And I can handle more and more every day. And I'm making progress, but not enough.

So I start restricting again. But I'm still exercising. But I still feel too full so I start purging again, even though I'm still exercising. And after a while I have a day where I'm so starved that I binge. And then purge. And the cycle continues.

And I start to eat things that aren't food. I'm eating my fingernails, bits of paper (hardback book paper tastes best), pen caps... And I purge that too, because anything being in your stomach for too long is obviously poison.

"So i (f21) had an ed for 3 years (anorexia and bulimia) and been recovering for 4. In my class, there is this girl who is clearly very anorexic. I can see all of her behaviours (not ever sitting down, perfectionism, never eating lunch or anything, exercising VERY excessively for multiple hours every single day, being very underweight, bragging about only eating vegetables, being clearly very insecure but needing a lot of attention, hair loss, brittle finger nails.... the list goes on). She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled. At that moment i felt a panic attack setting in. I recovered all on my own and told almost no one, and every time i talk about it, i get anxiety and panic attacks.

"Today my sister and I got into an argument of sorts. She said she was having a bad day. When I asked her why, she told me to just be grateful I “don’t have any problems”. 

I knew she was referring to her eating problems. She told me before how she gets annoyed when her friends complain about their problems because at least they “don’t go hungry every day”. She says that everyone else’s issues are “external” and fixable (e.g. having an exam to sit: the problem is over once the exam finishes) whereas her ED is “internal” - it’s part of her that she can never change, that affects her constantly.

I was initially annoyed that she assumed I didn’t have problems. I do. I just choose not to share them with anyone. I struggle with gender dysphoria, which I would consider to be “internal”, like hers. But I didn’t feel like coming out to her just to prove a point.

Anyways, I ask her the question “So, if you were born on a desert island with no people to interact with, no society, but all the resources you would need to survive, would you have these eating problems?”

I wanted to prove a point to her. The point being: your problems aren’t actually internal - they are a consequence of society. I posed this question partly to prove my sister wrong and partly because I care about her and want her to think critically about why she has her ED.

She mumbled a response, her eyes not meeting mine. “Sorry?” I said. I looked over at her and realised that her voice was choked with tears as she said “No”.

We were on a walk to the shops together and she cried quietly the way there. I felt like I had struck something important inside of her, some sort of realisation. But I also felt terribly guilty for upsetting her. I apologised when we reached the shops and she said “It’s not your fault.”

I want to encourage my sister to talk to me about how she feels about food, and she likes to occasionally. I’ve always felt like talking it through rationally might help. Today was a mess though. I was on edge the rest of the day, not wanting to make her cry again.

I want to help her. It feels like the only way I can is to reach her through words. But I don’t have an ED myself, and I fear I’m doing it all wrong.

So I've gotten into a huge restrict - binge cycle and I've been purging recently. Today I ended up eating cake since I assisted to 2 birthdays.

As a young male teenager I think I had a ED but I’m not entirely sure. I used to skip lunch frequently at school so I would have breakfast at 7am and then not eat anything till like 5pm. I did this on and off for about 8 years. I’m not sure why I did it but it would get to the point where I would feel faint annoyed and exhausted pretty much everyday. I’m not sure if it was an ED as it doesn’t match any of the descriptions. I also did this unconsciously and didn’t see anything wrong with it at the time but now when I look back I think why?

Hi, I’m in my early 30s and I struggle with anorexia. I am underweight (borderline) and I am worried about fainting or having an episode that I end up in the hospital for. My husband has been begging me to get labs done but I am not ready for recovery again. Last time I felt like a cow being funneled oatmeal and it makes me nauseous and anxious just thinking about again. My question is, if something ever were to happen where I were to end up at a hospital, could they force me to recover? Admit me and force me to stabilize or tube me? Or is that just a thing for minors. Or do they just say “yep you’re sick, follow up on the outside goodbye” or do they keep you?

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you. I don't like the idea of veganism or cannibalism.

"I think I just want to share this to see if other people have had / are having a similar experience. 
I’ve physically recovered from anorexia, which i had been working towards for a good two years or so. Anyway, about a year ago my mum went on a diet in an attempt to lower her blood sugar. she did a great job and did end up lowering it as well as losing a very decent amount of weight too. Recently she’s laid off being too restrictive in her eating which makes sense since she reached her medical goal. The thing is, while she was on the diet i felt uneasy about it because it felt weird eating so much when she was eating so consciously and i also didn’t like the idea of her feeling like she had to lose weight. but now that it’s changed, i’ve found myself really anxious and overly aware of all her eating habits. Like, if she goes to get seconds or if she has a lot of treat food etc, i just notice. in my head i’m thinking “don’t do it, you don’t need it you want it” and all those dirty ed thoughts. i’m not sure what it is or what to do with it but it annoys me because i’d hate it if someone was thinking about my choices like that. I want to mention that i’m certain she has no idea about this, and i don’t want her to know because i would hate her to be self-conscious about it. It’s also worth noting that, sure sue has a bit of extra fat on her but i’m sure she wouldn’t even be classed as over weight. she eats very healthily 80% of the time so i’d say she actually has a very balanced diet. i think what pains me is the idea of her gaining the weight back and being disappointed? i feel like i might be projecting my own feelings onto her?

anyway, TLDR: my (overall healthy) mum has a sweet tooth and i can’t stop my intrusive thoughts about her eating when i see her pick up some treat food.",,Anxiety about loved one’s health / eating,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10nxkhg,1,kingkurtiss,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10nxkhg/anxiety_about_loved_ones_health_eating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10nxkhg/anxiety_about_loved_ones_health_eating/,1674962379,362,0,0,0,-1,1,Mother going on and off restrictive diet post-anorexia recovery which triggers the writer’s intrusive thoughts about eating habits,harmful,"['Feeling uneasy and anxious about eating when mother had been dieting', 'Intrusive ED thoughts when the mother eats treat foods']",Mother's eating habits,harmful,"['The writer feels anxious and has intrusive thoughts when they witness their mother eating treat food or going for seconds', 'They are projecting their own fears of weight gain and disappointment onto their mother']","Mum going on a diet and losing weight, now being overly aware of her eating habits",harmful,"['Experiencing intrusive thoughts and anxiety around her mum’s eating habits, feeling uneasy and projecting her own feelings onto her mum']",,
"I am very confused as to why my body reacts that way that it does to inconsistent nutrition. In no way am I starving myself but for someone reason if I miss breakfast or just whatever I struggle to eat later. It's like my body is fighting me against every bite.

I honestly have tried so many things to reduce the stress on my body- rapid breathing, yoga, exercise, sleeping early, trying not do do anything all day and just sit around, trying to eat consistently every few hours or so, masturbating, medications that are supposed to help with anxiety/depression.... I even tried having a romantic relationship with someone that I had probably shouldn't have because I thought maybe doing so (for the first time in my life) could somehow help me out of my predicament. I didn't follow through on that because it seemed a little illogical. 

I honestly hate being in this state because it's like I'm alive but can't actually have a life. I can't do so many things that I want to- some of which are just simple things like study and work- and in the absence of these I just don't know what the heck my life is worth. I've been this way for seven years and every day I wake up and think - today's going to be different, today somehow I'll have three decent meals and snacks and record my meals and I'll do what it takes to nourish my body. and every day WITHOUT FAIL, I DO NOT SUCCEED.

I used to be so ambitious and hardworking and felt like my life was in my hands but this issue has honestly stymied me on every front. I can't even understand why this keeps happening because I don't have an eating disorder mentality anymore and I want to have fun and live my life and meditate but I can't do any of these things because I always feel like something is off in my body but not like a medical diagnosis just a lack of adequate food and sleep. 

I don't understand how or why this happened. I just want it to be over and every day that goes by with me continuing to live like this just is worsening my health. I am so smart and talented but I'm not getting to enjoy those things or live independently of my family because of this bullshit situation.

"On and off for about 8 years now I’ve struggled with anorexia. In May 2022, it really got bad and since then I’ve restricted to only a few small “snacks” per day i.e., slice of pie at 11am, cup of yogurt at 9pm is pretty typical for me.

Anyway now I’m in recovery and I find that I feel like I’m going to vomit after eating. I think it might be because I’m having a larger food intake during the day, like a muffin in the morning, small snacks throughout the day and a proper dinner at night. For so long I haven’t adhered to breakfast, lunch and dinner, so I think it’s important in the recovery process to practice getting used to that again, and it has been a gradual build up to the food intake.

"Hey everyone, over the last 3 years I have struggled pretty heavily with food. I'm gonna summarize what's happened so far, and will put my question after this paragraph if you want to skip.

I used to be very very obese, and I decided to start slowly eating better. I also started fasting. A few months into this, I went to the doctor, and got some scary blood work. An almost too high a1c. My lab numbers have always been bad, but the a1c sent me into a health anxiety tailspin. I kept cutting stuff out and eating less and less. I also slowly took on a keto diet. I also started regularly working out. I started to test my blood sugars all the time. I would even challenge myself by drinking a bunch of sugar water and testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours. My numbers were always normal. My fingers would be bruised all the time. Then, I started having some bad body symptoms. Basically a tremor. I freaked out and went to the doctor. Got a bunch of blood tests that showed malnutrition. I was asked about my caloric intake, and after thinking for a while I realized I was eating basically nothing. I started to bulk up my meals with low carb stuff: cheese, veggies, nuts, meat, and felt a lot better. Still tested my sugars whenever I ate carbs. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm close to a healthy weight now, all my numbers are pretty great, except my cholesterol is a touch high, but not as high as it was when I was heavy.

Well, now I'm concerned about my low carb diet, and I want to move toward a more balanced, healthy one. I'm terrified, because carbs equal blood sugar testing for me, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time. My concern is, could this just be an evolution of my disordered eating? Being so concerned with healthy foods that it's just bringing me out of a low carb diet and into a Mediterranean one? I'm so exhausted. This takes up most of my thoughts every day.

"TW - not sure if this is the thread to post in, but any advice is appreciated!

A close friend of mine has been struggling with disordered eating for a few years now but denies it, and whenever I feel like she is starting to get better, she seems to relapse again. 

She seems to get a lot of satisfaction from mentioning when she's gone a whole day without eating, and when she's lost weight or dropped clothing sizes. I don't know what to say or do, it's so worrying, and I feel like whenever I have tried to address it in the past it's gone nowhere. It's worse that I have always been the smaller friend despite my huge appetite, and she seems to compare herself to me. 

She makes out she is obsessed with health and tries all these fads like intermittent fasting and substituting meals for coffee/tea and 'health elixirs', but then she talks about how she's deficient in all these nutrients and never has any energy. It's like she intentionally overlooks the fact that her symptoms are because she doesn't eat properly... She also now claims she can't eat all these things because of self-diagnosed digestive issues (which I think she has also given herself by living off black coffee on an empty stomach...) 

I'm worried about her health, and our friendship hasn't been the same since her disordered eating (we often bonded over cooking and eating together, but these days when we hang out, she tries to fill our time with store-hopping or whatever else so we miss meal times and I end up so hangry by the end of it, despite my attempts to ask for a snack or meal break). Recently, one of our friends had a picnic for their birthday and she didn't eat anything because she claimed to have had a big meal beforehand. I don't know if anyone else notices but it's so obvious to me and I feel so helpless.",,Help for Friend with ED,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10mvq28,1,lillybebe,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10mvq28/help_for_friend_with_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10mvq28/help_for_friend_with_ed/,1674852745,331,0,0,0,-1,1,"A friend who denies having an eating disorder, satisfaction from not eating for a day, obsessive focus on weight loss, claims of being obsessed with health, comparing oneself to others, missing meals and choosing activities over meals, self-diagnosing digestive issues",harmful,"[""The writer is concerned about their friend's health and wellbeing, and feels helpless in addressing their friend's disordered eating"", ""Their friend's focus on weight loss and denial of an eating disorder is causing strain on their friendship"", 'Missing meals together is impacting their bond as friends']",,,,,,,,
"Hi all! First time visiting this community so apologies if I overstep any boundaries. 

My best friend since childhood struggles with binge eating disorder. I don’t know how many people in her life know, but I do know that she’s said before I’m one of the only people she feels comfortable talking to about it. (She has regular visits with a therapist- this is more of a “venting to a friend” type situation)

The thing is, I’ve never struggled with an eating disorder. I definitely have self-image issues and have been on some diets I probably shouldn’t have been, but nothing I would classify as an eating disorder. 

My main question is: how do I help? I love that she looks to me for encouragement, but I’m so scared of accidentally saying something that makes her feel worse even if it’s completely unintentional.

She texted me this morning that she binged last night for the first time in weeks and that she just needed someone to talk to about it. It took me nearly 20 minutes of just staring at the message to come up with a response because while I want to help and be someone she can talk to, I have truly no idea what to say. 

I guess my main question is if you were in her position, what would you want/need to hear from a friend offering support and comfort? Any phases or specific wording to avoid? I want her to continue to feel like she has a friend who she can talk to about this stuff but I’m completely lost on how to respond.

"Sorry for a really long post, I'm a bit scattered right now and it turned into a stream of consciousness. I think I'm just looking for reassurance/support?

I've had issues with a restrictive ED since I was a teenager, I've been self-recovered for a few years; I don't engage in the more severe disordered behaviours anymore, and I've got a handle on the more subtle ones most of the time. I'm a medically healthy weight, and I generally do my best to work through the negative self esteem stuff, but I would say that's probably the hardest part to shake off. I still have weeks here and there where I'm too ashamed of my appearance to leave the house. It's improved significantly this year, but I'm definitely not perfect.

I had deliberately avoided getting a doctor, dietician, or ED specialised therapist involved in my recoverg because I have some trauma stuff that makes me very afraid of medical/psych professionals, especially regarding ED/body image. But I did go to therapy during the first few years of recovery, just not to a specific ED treatment focused person. And that really helped me handle my thoughts and behaviour patterns, but of course a therapist can't really give nutrition advice, so I've been winging it as best as I can with the research available to me, but there's so much contradictory and questionable info out there.

This year in particular, I've been really wanting to get back into athletic hobbies (running and dance) because they used to bring me a lot of happiness and I really miss them. I know I'll need to give myself enough energy to handle the increase in activity but I feel honestly unequipped to navigate that on my own. So, I've started working with a dietician to get some outside support to make sure I won't burn myself out. She seems really grounded and knowledgeable, she knows about my ED history and is tailoring her approach with me to make sure she's not pushing me back into old habits. I think this is the right decision for me, but oh man am I ever nervous about it.

I'll be getting my first set of meal plans from her tomorrow and I'm really scared. It'll be a relief to have some structure and not have to stress over every decision myself, but I'm super nervous that I'm going to gain loads of weight and that it'll trigger a relapse. I know that she's not going to design a meal plan that would cause that, and I know I'm going to need to eat more if I want to increase my activity levels, but I'm having a lot of trouble shaking off the fear. I'm worried that every option (exercise, don't exercise, eat, don't eat) is going to somehow cause me to gain weight and be unhappy with myself forever. Obviously that's irrational but I'm struggling to get my brain to shut up.",,Anxiety about working with a dietician,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10m4mpb,1,PigeonSmidgeon,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10m4mpb/anxiety_about_working_with_a_dietician/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10m4mpb/anxiety_about_working_with_a_dietician/,1674772374,492,0,0,0,-1,1,Working with a dietician,neutral,"['Gaining structure and support to increase activity levels', 'Experiencing fear and anxiety about following the meal plan and potential weight gain', 'Struggling with negative self-esteem and body image']",Working with a dietician to support her athletic hobbies by creating a meal plan,neutral,['Fear and anxiety around the meal plan causing her to gain weight or trigger a relapse'],Working with a dietician to increase activity levels,helpful/harmful (unclear),"[""Seeking outside support to make sure the increase in activity won't lead to burnout"", 'Having structure for meal plans is a relief and reduces stress', ""Feeling scared of gaining weight and triggering a relapse despite knowing the dietician won't design a plan that would cause that""]",,
"For some context I struggled with anorexia and bulimia for a few years. I was always overweight as a kid, but lost an extreme amount of weight my freshman year of college.

"Hey Reddit!

I have been dealing with stress eating / emotional eating from few years. I completely lost hold of myself over the years as I ended up taking stress alot (an abusive relationship, another failed relationship, job related stress, not so peaceful home life, Covid era and the likes).

I have always loved food however this also meant with even a minute feeling of stress I would reach over to the food that is available to me at the earliest or my comfort food which is usually junk. I did not realise how this was impacting me until my weight tremendously increased. The effect is visible on my face, my belly, my arms the most. It was too late by the time I realised and now I genuinely do not know how to stop. 

I work a stressful job and I have constant hunger pangs and I reach out to food. No matter how hard I am trying I am unable to recover. 

Could you all please help me cope with this? I would really want to go back to my healthy self, please.

"Hi everyone, I’m new to this subreddit and hoping to get some ideas from y’all. It might potentially be triggering though.

I’m recovered from anorexia-turned-bulimia (after 10 years) since 2010, then had three kids with various weight fluctuations, nothing major though. After my recovery I managed not to weigh myself at all and eat pretty much intuitively for almost another 10 years. That is until I had a complicated/high risk third pregnancy in 2020. Suddenly regular weigh-ins were required by my doctors and I wasn’t allowed to exercise or get my heart rate up at all. The postpartum period was tough as well. 

I ended up with chronic hypertension, messed up blood fat levels and a pretty high body fat percentage. I’m expressly not asking for advice on these medical issues, just mentioning them for context. The point is: my current doctor advised that I lose weight and I’m really unsure how to go about that.

I’ve tried implementing more veggies in my diet and cutting back on fats and sugars without measuring anything, but the thought alone that I *have to* lose weight now is triggering binges and intense guilt whenever I eat something „unhealthy“. It feels like fighting fire with fire. If I lost weight and lowered my blood pressure, but relapsed into an ED, it wouldn’t exactly help my overall health either.

So my question is:

"Hey! So I'm about 2 weeks in recovery and slowly putting some weight on and logically I'm aware that that's a good thing, because I was very underweight and I should gain so that I can be a healthy weight. But. With a healthier weight come rolls. One of the many reasons why I did what I did is that I couldn't bear the feeling of skin/fat rolls when I slouched. I don't know how to be ok with having rolls when I bend or slouch, or pose myself in a sort of ""shrimp"" position. The sensation of light pressure the rolls give me makes me feel absolutely horrible. I know that the only reason I had basically no rolls before is that because I was severely underweight, but that doesn't stop me from feeling horrendous about having them now. It's more about the bodily sensation than the body image issues, I just can't stand the physical feeling at all.

"Today, I went shopping at Sam’s club. Cool, normal. I normally don’t like to go shopping in store anyways because I just don’t like grocery stores.

I was thirsty and they have cups by checkout. I almost left without buying one but added one on and got myself a berry Mountain Dew zero. I know for a fact I got zero.

"TW: MENTIONS OF RELAPSE.

.

.

I have been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now with on and off recovery which never lasts long. 

In 2020 when covid hit i gained a bit of weight and became depressed then developed and ED, I have told my bsf about it and tbh she was not very understanding of it, she is one of those people who think its my chice and i could just eat. I obv can't change someone's thoughts and believes so i never really bothered. later that year i decided to start recovery and i mentioned it to her, while all my family were supportive of this decision, one time i was showing her my breakfast ( we used to send each other daily vlogs and stuff) and mentioning how I'm starting to be healthier and bla bla bla, she them replied back with ""OH MY GOD! You eat sooo much food wow, that's probably as much as my brother, wow."" This was the most triggering thing someone ever commented on my food. the thing is my ""big"" breakfast was too hard boiled eggs, 2 low carb crackers and a bunch of veggies... 

i felt sooooo guilty and i believed that it is too much and always been afraid to eat like that in fear of being perceived like so. Anyways, needless to say that it made me relapse immediately and honestly thinking of recovering is never serious as it was back then. 

The thing here is , she knows I've relapsed and i never really talked about my ed with her ever since. However, she still to this day says the most triggering things ever. Like ''Oh, i haven't eaten since yesterday."" ""I haven't eaten for 24hrs"" ""I only had tea for breakfast"" and so more of these, the thing is she does not have an ed... she just likes to brag like some of those people, and she knows that i have an ed and she still brags to me. 

she sometimes checks on me if i ate or not and all that but it doesn't really differ when i know that she believes I'm pathetic and ""its all my choice""

"I’m currently classified as EDNOS. My eating disorder used to swing back and forth between binge eating phases and extreme restriction phases. My binge eating was very unhealthy but it used to provide a big comfort to me in stressful times. 
Now days I’m attempting to work on things and eat correctly. When I feel stressed or upset, I feel the desire to binge and sometimes I’ll even prepare binge food, but I’ll take a couple bites and then become disgusted with the food. My brain will start telling me, “You already ate 3 meals today. That’s already so much more than I’m comfortable with! Stop right now!”
Often I’ll end up throwing away the binge food. Then I’ll go sit down somewhere. But since I’m still stressed, my brain will eventually start telling me I’m hungry again because it wants the rush from a binge. But that same brain also won’t let me binge any more?? It’s all so confusing.
I know I need to eat, but because I’m eating more, my eating disorder will NOT allow me to eat any more than my meal plan allows. So I’m left without both ED coping mechanisms.
Obviously neither restriction nor binging are good copying skills. I don’t want to engage in either one. I’m autistic and when I feel like I’m gonna have a meltdown, I used to pacify myself with binging. Now I feel repulsed by the idea of binging, which is good in some ways.

"I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

Since the day I was born, the only food my family has had in the house is unhealthy. It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. 

Everyone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. 

But it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. 

As I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. 

But I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. 

But I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die.

"So I'll try to shorten the story as much as possible since it's really long if I get into details (Spoiler: it ended up being extremely long anyway, oops!)

&amp;#x200B;

When I first met my gf she was still with her ex-bf of 4 years, but they had had a lot of issues and were always fighting so she wanted to break up with him but she felt bad thinking he would be sad about it. So she didn't leave him until some time after.

&amp;#x200B;

We started to get along and to meet more often, and eventually we showed attraction for each other and some night, probably drunk, we... did stuff. At that time I was really uncomfortable with my body already but knowing someone was attracted to me kinda helped to get through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and she eventually broke up with her ex, she had always told me she really liked me and would like to have a relationship but she couldn't because she was still with the guy. At this point I knew she would need time to be alone, to heal from her past, toxic relationship before getting into another one so I did that, gave her time.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually it was her bday and she made a party where she invited some of her highschool friends, she told me she used to fancy this one girl who was coming but she hadn't seen in a long time, and I thought nothing of it. Little did I know, she (my now gf) ended up getting drunk and making out with the girl she fancied in front of me.

&amp;#x200B;

A week went by and she stopped giving me any attention when we were together and she was even more distant now, she spent the time we were together texting the girl in question and sending her love messages and stuff. She was never very affectionate with me whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I stopped talking to her at all. It made me feel extremely bad. I knew the other girl was hotter than me and prettier than I am and I was so jealous because of course she would rather be with her, I would too.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time after she texted me saying that she didn't know what happened or why we weren't okay (as in our friendship) and I ended up meeting with her. I had got a girlfriend at this point but I really, deep down, loved her so, after more rounds of gin that I can count, I ended up cheating on my gf.

&amp;#x200B;

So to finish this story, I broke up with my ex-gf and started dating her, and they lived happily ever after.

&amp;#x200B;

FALSE, those things that happened still haunt me to the date and I spent last night crying and couldn't sleep at all thinking about it and it has grown a lot of anxiety in me. I also I'm at my worst with my ED right now so I feel really bad overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the reason to this post is she is meeting with the girl she changed me with next Wednesday and I can't shake the thought that she preferred her over me. This is really triggering to me and I refuse to it anything until everything has passed. How can I get over what happened? Or how can I make it less triggering?

"My best friend (I'll call her S) told our friend group that she's been struggling with anorexia for a year over three months ago. We all really really want to help her but she's struggling so much. And I think I'm making it worse.

S is fragile and emotionally unstable, just in a very bad headspace. My husband and I have been taking on most of the effort in helping her recover. She stays with us most of the time and feels comfortable in our home. She's been making a small amount of progress, but she dips a lot and will relapse constantly. 

But last week I got into a big argument with one of our other friends. She (I'm gonna call her D) says that I'm hurting S just by being around her and I need to let more of the group be involved in her recovery.  

I've always been a very thin girl and many times throughout my life I've been told I look like I have an eating disorder. It's not something I've ever personally dealt with though. On a few occasions, S has said she wants to look like me. I always tell her I would rather her look like herself.

So D and I got into this fight, and when I told my husband, he actually agreed. I asked S and she said I'm not a problem, but I'm not sure I can trust her judgment about this.

I really really need advice. Am I actually making her fail her recovery? Do I need to take myself out of the picture?

"Apologies if this ain't the place for this kinda question and I'll axe the post if so. Also wanna say I ain't no shrink or ED expert so I'm spitballing on a lotta this.

My girlfriend has been showing what I believe to be signs of distorted body image (again, not an expert). She ain't obese or nothing but is a bit on the plump side, and I love that about her. But she makes frequent comments about how she eats too much, and not like once or twice; seems like it's damn near every meal we have together. I've also caught her looking at herself in the mirror a couple of times in what's obviously a body check, though I didn't say nothing about it at the time. She does go to the gym and sometimes we even go together since we both love doing it but she ain't obsessive about it. She ain't there 7 days a week or nothing.

Thing is we ain't been together all that long so I’m still figuring out what she responds to and how she communicates, and it feels rude asking straight up about it at this stage. What I really want to do is tell her how sexy she is but I know some folks don't like being told they're wrong about themselves even if it’s meant to be encouraging, plus I figure a topic like this could get dicey real fast so misstepping this early on could mean stepping on a landmine. What I do now is laugh a bit at her comments about herself with a half-joking ""now that's just crazy talk"" kinda response. Usually she laughs but I wonder if that's really helping.

Also don't know if this matters at all but she's Pakistani and was raised Muslim and another friend of mine from that part of the world told me it ain't uncommon for young women to get negative comments about their figures, skin tone, and just about everything else from their own family coming up. I know that happens stateside all the time but apparently it can get pretty nasty over there. Ain't met her family so got no clue if that's true about her though.

Would like any input, especially from folks who also struggled with body image shit and what your partners, friends or family did or didn’t do that genuinely helped. Some other folks in other subs mentioned complimenting things like her intellect or the clothes she wore that day (things she chooses) and I been doing that. Seems like it helps.

"I guess we are in this sub because of the conscious fear of eating and gaining weight, so to be like “How do I become comfy with myself” is rhetorical, but really, I just want to be comfortable in my body for once in my life. I go through phases where I am okay not having a completely flat stomach and carrying a little extra weight, and in these periods of my life I am usually the happiest… but then the self loathing kicks in and feeling valueless for not looking “perfect” anymore. Since starting college and finding career and academic success, I have gained a lot of self confidence and I feel worthy in a way I never had… I think it made me less reliant on my looks for the feeling of validity, so that has been positive for me. But, the feeling that I’m not valuable unless I look a certain way won’t go away. The reality is I can’t be successful in school and restrict, I am someone who needs carbs and “bad” food to have clarity of mind and conscious productive thinking. Career is more important than a bit of extra weight. Like I get that. And in effect trying to exist and attain balance with my brain and body and treat myself compassionately, it’s caused some weight gain, which is starting to bother me and cause me a lot of stress.
So yeah idk. I also try and rationalize the “WHY” I feel this way. So basically by obsessing over my body and appearance, I’m supporting capitalism that profits off women when I buy diet foods to get skinny and beauty products promising to smooth my skin and fix my face. The market sets the beauty standard, exploits our narcissism, and profits off it. I just don’t want to be a part that, but I think it’s impossible to disconnect. Anyways yeah idk, I wish I wasn’t a woman and didn’t have to deal with this. I take comfort in that even when I was my skinniest, I was also the unhappiest I’ve ever been.

"8 months ago, I decided it was time for me to loose weight because I kept being told “you’re getting chubby” and whenever I ate too much chocolate, chips, ramen noodles and other things I loved, I was told “you’re gonna get fat” and was even told “your stomach is getting bigger”. I never cared about how much I ate, what I ate. I ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted. 

But after deciding to loose weight, I started eating as little as possible. Restricted myself from sugar, any junk food. Tried eating healthy and mostly veggies. Did an hour of workouts 6 times a week and eventually reduced it to 5 times a week. Ate 3 meals a day after every 3-4 and didn’t eat anything else after 8PM (my third meal would be before 8PM and that’s it). I started seeing results of loosing weight. It made me really happy because I started fitting in more nice clothes and was getting happier with my body. 

The thing is that I lost my period after like 3 months of the start of my journey to this. Started loosing a lot of weight and was having no trouble. Whenever I saw any junk food or any other food, I wouldn’t be feeling like eating it. I had control. Didn’t even crave junk foods anyway. 

Because I had lost so much weight and my period, my aunt got worried and took me to the doctor. The doctor weighed me and said I was underweight for my age and height. But I didn’t care anyways and continued to eat little and workout. 

But on my 8 month of my journey, which was on December 29, during the holidays, I started to binge. The binge happened on new years Jan 1st when I had to go to a family event and they gave me sweets. I told myself “I haven’t had any sugary thing for months and since this is a family one time thing I should enjoy myself” so I ate a cookie that was on the table, then ate another, then another and another. Then ate many of the fruits on the table. And after I was done, my stomach felt so full. 

After that day, in the next day, I ate more than usual. I love having oatmeal for breakfast and I always have it like every other day and only once a day. The next day I ate 2 oatmeal’s, one in the morning, one at night. I started having oatmeal everyday after that and ate 2 then eventually went to 3. Then I started eating junk food. Ate so many chocolate that was given to me during the holiday gifts, then ate so much Nutella, and chips with cream cheese. I kept basically binging. 

After the holiday weeks break was over for me (Jan 9), I said I’m gonna get back on track and eat healthy again. So I did for 5 days and had control of myself. After 5 days, I started to binge again till now. My stomach is getting bigger again and I’m scared to gain all the weight I had 8 months ago back again. I still worked out 5 times a week during the holidays while I was binging, and still am to this day. But the binging is making my stomach get bigger and my face chubbier. I don’t want to get back to how I used to look like. 

Recently I had to give a blood test because my doctor told me to since I still don’t have my period back yet for about 6-7 months and he said I need to reduce my workout to 2 times a week and eat more.

On the other hand, I keep binging and have no control even though I keep telling myself “this is my last binge I won’t do it again tomorrow”. Basically with the binging I am eating more. However, the fact that my stomach is getting bigger and my face puffier, it makes me feel guilty after every binge. I still workout 5 times a week but it’s 20-40 minutes a day. I don’t know how I was so consistent and no food made me loose control but after the holidays I lost control of myself. 

The doctor did tell me to eat more, and I want to listen but with the eating more, I want to eat healthier not binge on chocolate chips, so much peanut and almond butter and other things.

"So I myself have recovered from a restrictive Ed, and been recovered for 10 years now. But the past month, a friend of mine has relapsed with her anorexia(she has a history but I’ve only known her for 2 years so never seen her unwell in this way). However, from pretty much the beginning, she has been open about every single one of her behaviors and consequences of those behaviors to me and to the internet.

The worse my Ed got, the more secretive I got. The worse my partners teenager anorexia got, the most hidden and secretive her behaviors were.

However, with my friend, she is literally sharing when she faints public ally even though she is very much aware how much it is worrying people, and simultaneously she is sharing about how guilty she feels worrying people. She has support; and lots of it, so I am so confused as to why she wants to constantly tell people how bad things are getting for her.

How can I help direct her to talk about her feelings instead of her behaviors?

She has completely disregarded my own triggers in all of this, and is very upset with me for setting boundaries with her regarding my own triggers saying no one else has reacted the way I have. She very much wanted to keep sharing every single behavior with me even though she knew how much it worried me. I want to know what is going on for real.

"Hello! Looking for some advice on a how to help my sister who struggles with anorexia and bulimia. This has been an ongoing issue since her teenage years, she’s now in her late 30’s and has been in and out of recovery over the last years. With the biggest scare being about 8 years ago when her blood levels became so out of wack she almost succumbed to her eating disorders. Over the last year I have noticed some things that have made me question where she is currently at in her recovery process but know how tender the subject is and have never pressed the issue. 
Then comes tonight when her 16 year old daughter, my niece, comes to my mom and I in desperation for help for her and her mom. She’s beyond worried about her mother whom she states is barely eating and when she does is vomiting. Talking about no food in the house (she herself looked quite gaunt tonight and was asking for food… que the pizza lol), and how her mom has overall been acting off lately and treating her differently as well. 
Looking for any advice on how to handle this situation and how to get my sister the help she needs. Us as a family would do anything to help her but don’t know where to start and the last thing we want to do is push her away or make her angry with her daughter for coming to us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Today i did , I told her what I saw, I know its a sensitive subject so I didn't want to pry, I told her that if she ever wanted to ralk I am here and that I want us to have an open communication about this. she went silent for awhile and iasked if we could talk about it and she said that she never wants to talk about this and said i was snooping. she wont sleepin the same bed as me now. i dont know what to do. i am not going to force her to talk about it, i am just reallt scared of losing her to something like this. please any advice is welcome. i feel like i have ruined everything, and that she will never trust me again.",,help,1,one,question,,,,t5_2qpcj,10hjpq7,1,burnnnnner0101010111,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10hjpq7/help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10hjpq7/help/,1674279053,248,0,0,1,-1,1,Discovering pro-ana posts saved on girlfriend's device and attempting to talk about her eating disorder,unknown,"['Girlfriend became defensive and refused to talk about her eating disorder', 'Girlfriend is now avoiding sleeping in the same bed as the writer']",Finding pro-anorexia posts and trying to talk about it with girlfriend,harmful,"['Girlfriend gets defensive and refuses to talk about it, causing tension in the relationship', 'Writer is scared of losing their girlfriend to her eating disorder']",The girlfriend having an eating disorder and the boyfriend trying to address it,unknown,"['The girlfriend responds defensively and does not want to talk about it, causing tension in their relationship', 'The boyfriend is feeling scared and unsure of what to do or how to support his girlfriend']",,
"So, just a little info: I’ve been vegetarian for 5 years, and went vegan about 2 years in and kept it up for about 2 more years. I realized being vegan, for me, was a little restrictive as I have some texture aversions and don’t like a lot of things (still veg), so a lot of times I wouldn’t eat at events or nights out. I definitely noticed a bit of disordered eating going on. It wasn’t normal, I looove food. I love eating!

Pretty often, probably like once a week or every two weeks this past year, I would throw up from being so hungry. Or, even if I wasn’t starving, just knowing that I’d have to go to a restaurant and eat something, even just imagining the smell or smelling it, made me sick and I’d have to go throw up in the bathroom mid-meal.

I’ve been absolutely wonderful the last probably 2-3 months and have been eating healthy, good amounts and didn’t feel sick or weird once. Never even thought about it. It’s been great.

Now, I’ve been really depressed for the entirety of the last week, and haven’t been eating. It got to a point where I was so hungry I threw up bile 2 days ago. I was sad again yesterday and only ate a few veggie sausages to start my day, and then was SO hungry later, and after I got and ate a few fries, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up.

Is there a label to out on this or? I’ve had an extremely sensitive, queasy stomach since I had COVID, so maybe that’s it. I don’t know.

I try to eat consistently (snacking) to avoid getting so starving, but I don’t want anything. I quit one of my jobs so I have a lot of time now and that always throws me off. I need routine.

"Hi, this is, I believe, my first post and I need some help. I suspect one of my siblings may have had an eating disorder for a while now, but I don't know how to help. Although we have mentioned how this said sibling has gotten thinner and skipped meals and such, my mom makes every excuse to stray away from the idea that her child might need help. She either points out the things he has eaten or just stays silent and changes the subject. I fear for my sibling because he did lose a lot of weight in comparison to last year, almost unrecognizable, but I guess he sees it as a good thing because he is a lot more talkative during school. From what I have seen, he drinks A LOT of water bottles, even one time mentioning to us that if we ever wanted to lose weight just drink water until your stomach hurts. I do not know why these talks seem so normal in our family.

I might suspect I have an eating disorder myself too but how can I help someone when I do not even know how to take care of myself? It is very stressful to see him need help but no help being given.

"so i (20 m) have struggled with eating disorders on and off for several years, and have recently been starting to feel myself relapsing, although i’m not shocked as it’s my first year at college and that’s obviously stressful for various reasons. (not that it matters but i’m currently in the supposed “healthy” weight range.)

i have a close friend (i’m gay and she’s a lesbian so it’s not romantic in any sense) at school who i hang out with a lot since we’re on the same floor. she tends to be a very physically affectionate person, (as in cuddling, hugging, leaning on you, etc). there’s a few things regarding boundaries i know i need to talk to her about, but theres one specifically that i have no idea how to bring up. 

basically if we’re like hugging or cuddling she always talks about how i’m so “comfy” and “squishy” and “warm” which i know she means as like a good thing? but it really triggers me honestly. i feel so stupid for being bothered by it, but it’s difficult when i’m already struggling to figure out how to establish boundaries without hurting her.

 for context, while i of course enjoy hanging out with her, she definitely has attachment problems and has talked a lot about probably having bpd, and it’s not like i’d ever judge her for that, but in the case that she does have bpd, i am very clearly her fp and i’m nervous about how she’d react because there’s been a handful of occasions where she’s gotten clearly upset with me even over things like me not wanting to hang out because i’m not doing well or i need to go to bed earlier. she’ll get very snippy and will barely talk to or acknowledge me, and contrasted with her being over the top affectionate and saying she loves me every few minutes (which also kinda makes me uncomfortable), it makes me feel like such an asshole. 

 i know i need to talk to her about stuff but i have genuinely never told anyone i’ve struggled with an ed, although i’ve vaguely mentioned having had “issues with food” when talking with a few people, her including her. i’m honestly just afraid that if i try to talk to her about stuff, i’ll end up leaving out how uncomfortable i feel when she makes these specific comments about my appearance/body (which happens several times a week)

"I really need advice. I (16f) have a close friend (15f). We were best friends for several years, but covid just sort of distanced us. We still see each other and talk occasionally, but not on the level we did before. A few days ago, I was on twitter when I saw two old tweets I had bookmarked last year. They were both from the same account, one was about something that had happened at my school last year, and the other was complaining about the weather in my state. I thought it was odd that the person lives in my state and had the same thing happen to them at their school. I figured we probably went to the same school, and when I clicked on the account I realized it was an eating disorder twitter account. I didn't recognize the girls name, and when I asked a few friends, neither did they, and I forgot all about it. 

Until a few days ago when I found the tweets again and went back on the account, and noticed the way she tweeted was very similar to the way my 15f friend types. But the account had her age on the account and said she was 16 in her bio, so I figured it was just coincidence. But then I scrolled down and saw tweets from a few days before, where she thanked everyone for all the birthday wishes, and that's when i remembered my friend had just turned 16. As soon as I realized they had the same birthday, I just knew it was her and my heart dropped. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I don't want to confront her, because I'm worried she might try to hurt herself out of panic. Should I tell my mom so she can tell her mom? I don't really want her knowing I'm the one who told, but idk I'd rather her be mad at me then be dead or anorexic.

"I (14F) and my Best friend (14F) met eachother a few months ago. We get along really well and I love her so much but recently i found out that she has anorexia. 

Some time ago i installed Tumblr and asked her if she could give me her username. I'm pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username. When I saw her posts i literally froze. 

The whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet.

Some time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I couldn't have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. 

I started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I'm considering talking to her parents. 

She was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. 

I really don't want to lose her but I just can't stop worrying about it.

"Hi all,

I will not mention any numbers but I am curious if anyone has a similar experience. I have found each time I've relapsed I usually gain a bit of weight and then it tapers off over the following months. I shouldn't be surprised I guess that after almost a year of health problems that triggered a nearly year-long relapse is causing a similar effect. I am now at a weight I haven't been in 3 years since I was in the first two years of recovery and allowed myself to be overweight...this is a very scary thing for me and I'm trying to remain calm and not act drastically but I'm finding myself very triggered. I have a different mindset on recovery and my body after 5 years of recovery with various blips, i truly feel like i have learned...but you never know, ya know? I am tempted to ask my doctor to do some testing on me as I am concerned with the shear amount of weight in such a short amount of time with literally all that was done was just stop restricting, meaning i eat like a normal person (I have autoimmune gut disorders so not that normal but eat enough and can't eat inflammatory foods). The second qaundry is is there safe weight loss after recovery? I feel like most times I've gone at it like that I've ended up falling into old habits but now I am overweight (which you know obviously isn't the worst thing and i can still be healthy) and some of my abilities are obstructed.

I’ve never gone to a psychologist for it so I’m not diagnosed but I often only eat one small meal a day or not eat at all, which if anyone asks i generally just say i do intermittent fasting. It got better while i was overseas and i began eating 3 meals a day again and I thought everything was getting better and I didn’t have to exercise everyday if i ate but since ive been back I’ve been restricting again- almost feeling like j have to make up for the fact that i ate so much on my trip. I havent eaten anything in two days atp and while i always know i should, its almost paralysing bc i weirdly feel proud of myself for holding out for so long and also not feeling  hungry? I also feel like bc I haven’t had the motivation to workout I shouldnt eat much to make up for it which I KNOW logically is so wrong but when i tell myself i know i have to eat or get something in me, i just feel like i cant move, like my body is resisting it. I’m not sure what i can or should do atp bc its gone on for so long and while i know some people have notice my behaviours they dont know anything in depth and i feel like i cant talk to anyone about this",,ED relapse/help,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10gwivy,1,bluejvinyls,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10gwivy/ed_relapsehelp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10gwivy/ed_relapsehelp/,1674220046,248,0,0,0,-1,1,Restrictive eating,harmful,"['Has gone without food for two days, feeling proud of restricting', 'Feels paralyzed to eat due to the motivation to workout', 'Struggling to talk to others about their eating disorder']","Restrictive eating and feeling proud of holding out for long periods of time, feeling pressure to compensate for eating more in the past",harmful,"['Experiencing paralyzed feelings when attempting to eat', 'Friends noticing behaviors but not confiding in anyone']","Restrictive eating habits, feeling the need to make up for eating post-trip, feeling proud of restricting, lack of motivation to workout contributing to restriction",harmful,"['Feeling paralyzed when trying to eat', ""Resistance to eating despite knowing it's necessary"", 'Difficulty discussing eating disorder with others']",,

"I've been in a quasi-recovery state: so I wouldn't say entirely recovered, and still have a lot of progress to make regarding becoming more recovered. 

My therapist (she's wonderful), is not trained in eating disorders- just because at the current time while in school full time and also working full time- I don't have the ability to see a clinician that fully addresses eating disorders in their practice, and can not afford the ability to seek out a nutritionist or doctor. My therapist knows to the extent of what my eating disorder has looked like before- the severity, and also knows the intensity of interventions used before (i.e IP, Res, ACUTE, OP, IOP,) several times-- so I'm assuming she is aware right now while recently being in quasi (within the last year or so)- that a relapse or ""mini-lapse"" could occur. 

My therapist has told me to reach out to the crisis line if in a crisis- or out to her: which I have done a couple times regarding a situation with my partner (where he wasn't okay)- but other than that I have not reached out at all regarding food- I think for a weird reason, I feel uncomfortable reaching out to her about food, because I've had other therapists who have directly told me ""reach out regarding food if you are not okay"", and with her I feel like I have to be more ""put together"" than I am right now, because it's embarrassing to acknowledge that I'm slipping. 

Recently my partner, has been struggling with his own mental health (developed the symptom of psychosis), and on top of the academics I'm taking, as well as my three jobs- I've gotten really stressed out, to the point of engaging in behaviors: I want to address this with her, and I also want to be able to reach out to her in the moment, but I am weirdly concerned that she would sort of 'fire me' for the relapsing- or just not know what to do- because eating disorders are not in her scope of practice. I also know that she could potentially not do that, because I'm at a point where I'm about to drop one of my 19 credits- and cut the hours on one of my jobs, so I can sort of get into a less stressed out mindset, and recenter myself into a recovery oriented mindset.

"Lots of exposition, so beware.

I'm 20 years old, and I just dropped out of college. I've struggled with an eating disorder for about 6 years, and I've gone through the same cycle over and over again. Overeat, gain, feel sorry for myself, hoard and hide food, fight with my family, promise to be better and get help, I get help, I don't try, then I just go back to eating again. 

It's just been a constant cycle of failure after failure, and that's all on me. I couldn't even make it through the first semester of college because I blew through my savings on food. 

I'm at the point where something has to change, or else I'll just be like this for the rest of my life. My parents have given me chance after chance after chance. They've put up with my false promises and failures and then I drag myself back pleading for forgiveness, and another chance, and they give it. This is my last shot. I'm living with them while I get help, but if it doesn't work, I need to find another place to live and find a way to live with this ED. 

I'm going to go to therapy (first session is next week). What would be the first steps after that? I understand that I need to find the root of the issue (hence a psychologist), but while I do that, what are some good practices to include in my life? Do I focus on weight loss? Do I focus on forming healthy eating habits? Both at once? 

I just don't know where to start, because I'm so worried it will end up being a waste.

"For the past couple of months I've struggled with my relationship with food. I would have random episodes of binge eating until I am physically ill from the amount of garbage I have put in myself, but still am unable to stop. That would cause me to feel shame and utter disgust with myself and the way I would pig out on shitty food to feel comfort. Eventually, I realised I do that whenever I'm going through a tough period or when I feel a lot of stress. Due to this behaviour, I would stop eating for days. E.g I would eat and apple and that would be my meal for the entire day. The pain of being hungry would be so strong that I just fall back into the same spiral and binge until I can't fit anything in my stomach. It caused me pain, disgust, shame and contributed to having poor mental health and self-esteem issues. I feel so weak for this because I cannot fathom how something can control me and my life this much up to a point where it affects my entire day and every waking hour. What should I do?

To give some back history; i had my son a little over a year and a half ago, when I got pregnant with him i was really struggling, to the point of where my primary doctor and mother had a sit down intervention type of deal and basically told me to get my sh- together or go get the tube and some more intensive rehab…Of course I took the latter, didn’t have much choice in the matter due to the fact I also got pregnant with my little dude not even a few weeks later… I started to get healthier mentally and emotionally and physically as well and things seemed so good! Then literally the complete and total unthinkable happened, the father of my son died out of no where via what they claimed as suicide but the entire thing was fishy and multiple sources close to him were telling me it was a set up..that’s besides the point..a year and a half later after genuinely grieving not only my best friend but father of my sons death as well as other close circle friends who ended up dying tragically..I’m here crawling myself out of a deep pit of depression, past drug addiction, recovery after ECT (for those of you who don’t know what that is it’s probably a therapy that should be illegal… or at least more regulated..) and just being a young mom and college student… it’s a balance for sure!! It’s like balancing jelly beans man and it’s hard!

I love him more than anything and I’d die for my son…but sometimes I genuinely struggle to live for my son.

didn’t know what to do and of course went to a really expensive and almost occultist type vibe promising “a perfect daughter”, i kid you not the thing wasn’t even on google maps at the time, they did a lot of illegal shit which I actually found out about after I had gotten myself out and reconnected with old peers (story for another time) anyways; now a days I struggle.

"I'm not sure if i have Ed, but I struggle with eating so I thought this could be right sub to post this. If it's not, I'm sorry.

I struggle with eating. Usually i don't eat whole day and then i over eat at night.
It usually start with having no appetite in morning and when i skip breakfast im usually in not eating mood for rest of the day.

It just seems like nothing is appetizing. All i see are ingredients that need work to turn them into meals, but there is no motivation to do that. This post could also be titled as ""too lazy to eat"". I think that when i have some meals prepared from earlier i don't struggle that much to eat them. It also seems like the ""task"" of making decision of what to eat is just too hard for me to make so i rather starve.

But back to the mornings. Today was kind of exception because i actually got up early which is something i'm striving for, but since i got up early, I had to face the decision of what should i eat. 
As usual i opened fridge and realised that i don't feel like eating anything. I dint want to eat anything savory or sweet, so I decided to eat something ""neutral"" like oatmeal (boiled in water with pinch of salt). We didn't have oats at home so I went to store and when I got there and looked at all the different food I got appetite back and wanted to eat. 

It's usually like that... At home I struggle to decide but when I'm out it just get easier, maybe it's due to lack of decision making.

- A strong dislike for sharing food. My portions are MY portions. Unless we're at a restaurant and sharing is the only way I get to try different items on the menu. 
- In addition to the above, if I'm cooking and serving the food - the food has to be divided equally between me and my significant other. Even though his calorie requirements are much higher than mine. And I'm embarrassed to say this, but I struggle not to take more food or keep the best bits of the meal for myself when serving.
- If I share food someone, I must have the last bite.
- Some food hoarding 

I have absolutely no idea where this is all coming from and the weird thing too is that my sister seems to be sharing some of these issues. Growing up she also struggled with binge eating while I don't remember really suffering from that. We grew up in a lower middle household and we absolutely never went hungry. We grew up on non fancy, homemade meals and ate out sometimes as a family. We had access to fresh food and treats/sweets as well. Our parents did not restrict food intake.

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this. Thank you in advance!

I wanna start off by saying I’m not claiming to have an eating disorder and I hope I’m not offending anyone by this post. However I’m starting to worry it could possibly turn into one if I don’t do something about it. I’ve been pretty depressed the past month or two but I’ve had depression for years. I think it’s just hitting a little harder because of winter. I’ve been eating a lot recently and giving in to cravings constantly. I find myself painfully full but wanting to eat more and I usually do. It seems like I’m eating to cope with my emotions. Not only am I eating way too much but I’m eating really bad. I want to go back to normal eating habits and actually caring about what I’m putting into my body.

"hi. So, I’m fifteen and working hard on recovery. I was doing a lot better, but unfortunately I had a recent relapse. It happens, but I’m working hard now to get better (and you should too!) anyways, I have a friend I’ll call B. B, like way too many teenage girls, has gotten sucked into diet culture. I know I should probably just get over it, but it’s really upsetting to me when she says things like “all I’ve eaten today is *insert small amount of food*” again, I know that not everyone will always accommodate my triggers, but when it’s a close friend it’s a little trickier. I never told her about my eating disorder because I tried my best to keep things under wraps. Not that it’s anything to be embarrassed about, it’s just kind of hard to talk about, and people can be not so nice.

"I’m a recovering bulimic, I haven’t purged in over a year but I still struggle with laxative abuse but I’m working on it. 

My husband has some disordered eating habits of his own but in a different way. He’s very diet focused and will fast if it means hitting a weight goal, things like that. He doesn’t see what he has as an ED, which is fine I’m not a doctor but it’s still harmful behavior sometimes.

But he says things that are very triggering for someone who is recovering. For instance like I’ll eat like a candy bar or something and he’ll be like “bad!” But he’ll say it like he’s talking to a dog. It’s very demeaning and very triggering. I know candy bars aren’t good for me but the point is balance. When I was heavy into my ED there was no balance and often times I would eat something like that and purge it. 

I’ve tried talking to him about this by telling him how it makes me feel but he dismisses me and says things like ‘I just need coffee’ or that I’m ‘acting like a teenager’ because I “rebelled” and didn’t put the candy bar down etc.

I'm not saying this is a replacement for therapy or any other professional assistance, I'm just sharing something that may be helpful.

"I'm not quite sure if this is the right flair, I'm not really familiar with this sub but I need advice and have nobody irl who can give me input that will actually help.

I'm pretty sure my best friend has an eating disorder, I can't really say what kind but all I know is that he thinks he's ""fat"" (he is definitely underweight and even if he was overweight, I'd fucking love him all the same) and that doesn't really eat. It's difficult because I don't struggle with these kinds of body issues so I'm not sure what the appropriate way to confront/address this or if I even SHOULD address it. Plus, I know with men it's more complex because society really loves to emphasize eating disorders as a ""woman's mental illness"" even though sex/gender have nothing to do with body dismorphia and disordered eating.

I want to be a good friend. I want to try and help him but I know he doesn't really want help, and you can't force people to put the effort in when it comes to mental health. That just makes things so much worse.

But I can't sit back and let him kill himself like this, especially last night. We were drinking pretty heavily, then he throws up all over himself and its literally just liquid then I jokingly scolded him for drinking on an empty stomach while helping him clean up, and he says a line that is becoming more and more frequent from him these days- ""I don't need to eat."" I'll admit at that point, I had to go into another room and cry for a moment because that completely confirmed all the suspicions I've had the last few months. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. I really did.

"so my family doctor sent a referral to an outpatient (groups once a week) hospital program for me. i got a call from my family doctor’s receptionist who said that i need another appointment to fill out a questionnaire with my doctor because the hospital redirected me. when i asked her what that meant, she said my doctor will explain. but i have to wait until next monday to talk to my doctor and i am just so confused and freaking out because i don’t know what this means. 

my mind is freaking out because on one hand i’m taking this to mean they looked at my referral and think i’m not sick enough and they’re redirecting me to something less intense. but on the other hand i’m worried that they’re referring me to something more intense but i don’t feel ready for that and i don’t want it to interfere with my last semester of uni.

I weigh very little due to the fact that every time I feel sad, I feel anxious or I get sick because of a situation that I cannot handle, I stop eating... I stop eating for days to be able to feel hungry... that emptiness, that feeling of Hunger takes me to a known place, I need to be hungry to know that I have the situation under control.

"I’ve been dealing with BED for more than half my life. I’ve ruined my body inside and out and that realization, along with my husband’s support, gave me the motivation to try to get better. 

However, after seeing the number on the scale dropping quickly and steadily, I started getting a high from losing weight. The more weight I lost, the less I would eat, and the less I would eat, the easier it was to not binge. I would challenge myself to meet unhealthy goals, and I almost always met them. 

I stopped “dieting” for a few weeks after having my gallbladder removed and spent some time moderating while still eating what I wanted. Then I had a day where I couldn’t stop eating. I had one of my worst binging episodes ever and ended up violently ill the following day. 

I thought that would be my rock bottom and not binging would be easy after that, but I find when I eat the way I should, it makes me want more, making it nearly impossible not to binge. When I eat little to nothing, binging isn’t an issue so I tend to opt for that. I know this isn’t healthy, but I can’t find a happy medium. I feel doomed to a life of eating disorders no matter what I do.

I told my psychiatrist that I feel like I’m trading a food addiction for a weight loss addiction and she didn’t have much to say about it.

"Looking for some advice here. A close friend of mine has recently developed an eating disorder. It started last summer when she was in Paris doing modeling work.

She is in therapy, but her ED seems to be such a touchy topic for her. I can’t really get her to open up about it, which is fine- but I don’t think she talks to her therapist much about it either.

Sometimes she’ll say stuff like “Gosh, I haven’t eaten all day”, or when I’ll offer her food because I know she hasn’t eaten, she’ll refuse it.

"Girlfriend was sexually abused during her early teens by her family member who ''took care'' of her, and she was made to believe she was overweight and was starved by her caretaker in order for her to slim down, i will not go into much more details because i do not think they are suited here. So she associates food with overweightness, she does not see it as a fuel for her body to function just as something that is just bad for her, so now she would starve herself for weeks, she had 2 kids which changed her body the way pregnancy changes it and she thinks she should not work on her body but just on her eating disorder because that is the problem, i agree she should accept herself first the way she is, but i think it would be easier for her if her physique was a bit better, please someone correct me if i am wrong.

"I've always had a strange relationship with food. I've always been on the lower end of healthy BMI. Growing up I was a picky eater. Usually when I'm stressed/depressed I will go days without much more than a salad. Before my last swing in eating habits I tended to eat one large, unhealthy meal a day or sometimes just get by on a few slices of cheese.

&amp;#x200B;

But my main concern is this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently going through a phase that has happened probably twice before in my life where when I sit down to eat, hungry and with appetite, after a bite or two, it seems like my brain blocks the ability to swallow. Sometimes I end up gagging if I don't spit it out. That's it, meals over.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been living in quite a stressful situation at the moment, so I believe I know this is a trigger of mine.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting head aches, dizzy spells and it's causing changes in menstruation. I feel hungry a lot of the time but not in a painful way. Just empty really. I've been mostly relying on juices and sugary drinks for energy.

I go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn’t get completely out of hand.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

Before she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don’t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.

I usually have to takes meats or cheeses but they don't appeal. Food is boring and feels like work. I don't do breakfast so I often don't eat (or drink sometimes, because if I drink on an empty stomach I vomit) until I get home at 4. Food seems useless and if I don't like it I can't bring myself to eat it. Sometimes I'll even gag and have trouble swallowing despite there being no real issue with taste or texture.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm conscious about my weight but I still feel comfortable eating and still enjoy food, but only certain food. Some days I feel like the feeling of starvation would be better than eating whatever I have with me.

"I have a therapist that I see regularly for dealing with PTSD and this morning I brought up having some issues with eating over the past three months. I’ve been ignoring it because I already have enough issues, but my doctor is concerned about my weight loss (currently at xx  lbs when I need to weigh yy lbs minimum ... a significant amount) and my clothes have started hanging off of me.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and her husband (not my bio dad) always made comments about gaining weight even though I’ve always been thin and athletic. I think they were maybe projecting, idk. Lots of “once on the lips, twice on the hips”, “weight gain in your face is hard to lose and your face is round enough” (my face is not round at all), and other comments about my stomach having fat rolls (again, I have always been athletic, so these did not exist).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not really sure why it would be manifesting now that I’m in my early 20s; their comments usually went in one ear and out the other but now I can’t help but think that I look overweight. Particularly in my face, stomach, and hips. I know that, logically and realistically, I do not have any excess weight but I still fixate on it. I’m not super obsessed with counting calories or anything like that, but I do go one or two days at a time without eating on a regular basis and when I do eat, it’s usually something small like a bowl of cereal. I’m just worried I’ll put on weight, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not sure why it’s only now becoming an issue, but both my doctor and my therapist agree that I need to see someone about this. My therapist said this morning said that it sounds like I might have some body dysmorphia and an ED, but unfortunately that isn’t what she specializes in. She wants me to find an ED specialist and schedule an appointment with them by next Wednesday. And I’m also supposed to meet with my doctor about healthy meal plans and diets at some point.

i have an eating disorder but its not anorexia, bulimia, or anything where im trying to lose weight or be skinny. ive seen 4 psychiatrists, 2 ER doctors, and 3 therapists in the last 6 years and none of them have any answers for my symptoms. ok so sometimes i cant eat food because im stressed or im just not hungry, and then when i start to get hungry, i feel like the timings ""not right"" and i have to wait and try again. And im not doing this on purpose or to try and lose weight, i cant control when this happens. so then im finally able to eat, and i take one bite and im completely full. and for the people saying ""you have to force yourself to eat"" i literally cant because ive tried that many times and i usually throw up, not on purpose. sometimes food is just completely overwhelming and i literally just dont want it to touch my tongue. i dont have the mental energy to mash up food with my mouth or swallow it, everything sounds gross and makes me depressed. (it also doesnt help that i live in america and the fda approves carcinogens in our food) so for example, i couldnt eat for  days because the timing wasn't right (literal time of the day and other variables that include stress, feeling of stomach, how hot or cold the environment is and type of food + the texture of the food) and then today i decided i had to eat an entire pizza to make up for the calories i lost from not eating, and that gives me stomach aches which cause more anxiety. and now i wont eat until probably tomorrow night because i have work in the morning and it stresses me out so bad i cant eat there its so gross nobody wears their mask in the break room.

ive been having this same problem for about 5 years now and i am currently almost 21 and weigh about xx pounds (very low).

the only things that make it kind of bearable are mirtazapine and smoking weed.

i havent had any trauma regarding food in the past my parents have always had good eating habits and kept the fridge stocked with healthy foods and i was allowed to eat whenever i wanted when i was growing up.

but yea i really want to gain weight im sick of looking like a teenager, sometimes i get so much anxiety about it that jts hard to eat and its a horrible cycle i get stuck in

Hi Reddit. I’m 16, and a guy. I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen, and I think it’s affecting me largely enough to reach the point of an eating disorder of some kind.

I’m not going to detail too much as that’s not really what this post is about, but I restrict, I think as a result of both being unhappy with the way I look and feeling out of control of other things around me. I feel guilty about not eating healthily or exercising as much as I should, but in trying to do so I have always just ended up making myself feel worse and doing it for the wrong reasons. I used to develop a lot of weird stomach issues and with the handful of medications I’ve cycled through quite a few have really messed with my appetite, including my ADHD medication which of course I take daily. I’ve tried to deal with it on my own but as my general mental health has been improving a lot (which I am so grateful for), my habits and thoughts around eating have not and I think it might be time for me to get help.

I’ve mentioned my eating somewhat in passing to my mom and my former therapist, but neither seemed to understand fully what I was getting at. One of the first things I talked to my therapist about was how I felt I did not think of food in a healthy way but it was kind of just left there, and I mentioned to my mom when she began to notice my eating habits getting worse again during the very first lockdown here in Canada how I sometimes eat less if it means feeling in control of something. That was basically where the conversation ended. I don’t blame either of them because I have a hard time accurately describing things and minimizing them when I do, and I didn’t quite talk about the extent of these thoughts and behaviours.

I’m afraid to ask anybody for help and talking properly about how bad it’s gotten in the past and how it affects me day-to-day, even on good days, because I feel a strong sense of shame surrounding this aspect of my mental health. People generally think of EDs as a ‘girl thing’ which logically I know is absolutely not true and in theory I know that there’s no shame in the struggle that I’m having, but when I think about telling somebody and having them look at me and KNOW that this is something that’s on my mind all the time, I just feel so mortified. The thought of telling my mom makes me feel ill, and I have a very strong relationship with my mom and tell her everything, she’s been my main support through every other struggle I’ve had with my mental health and she’s supportive and understanding beyond what I would have ever hoped. But I just can’t stomach the idea of telling her more about this than I already have. I’m scared of telling anybody. The only person who really knows is my best friend, who also struggles with it. He’s the only one I’ve ever really talked about things in detail with, but of course he can only do so much and generally we steer away from talking about it with each other to avoid triggering the other or something.

Even typing this and sharing with people who will never know my name or anything about me other than this, I feel terrible. I don’t even really know why. I guess by admitting that something is wrong in more than my own head means it’s more real and I’m not ready for things to turn upside down to make me better somehow, and also maybe I just don’t want things to not be okay. I don’t know. But I’m really not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel like this all the time and trying to fix it on my own hasn’t worked but I also don’t want to talk to people and have them see me the way I see myself, as weak or something. I don’t know. I’m also scared of what treatment might look like for me. The idea of meal plans or being monitored in any way or anything just makes me feel sick and the idea of eyes on my eating habits more than they already might be makes me feel so anxious. I feel like I’m not ready to get help yet but I’ve also been telling myself that for years and I really want to feel better and be able to eat without feeling guilty. Sorry for the long post, I just really don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go or who to talk to, I considered talking to a teacher I trust but again I’m scared of how they might see me and I’m scared of burdening them with my issues or making them worry or something.

Thank you in advance for any and all help. I don’t entirely know what I’m looking for, because I don’t know if I will end up getting help any time soon.

"I’m just curious if I should seek help with this, it’s been effecting how I am able to function daily for quite some time but I don’t know if this is a disorder. Basically, I hate food and everything about it. I hate chewing, I hate the smells, I hate the textures, it all makes me nauseous. My body gets hungry, really hungry, but the thought of eating is absolutely repulsive. My stomach can be growling but still, the thought of eating is so unpleasant. The only “food” I can really think about eating without getting nauseous is like Naked Juices and soup, but let’s be honest, it’s unrealistic to switch to “drinking meals” for the rest of my life so I’d like to relearn how to want to eat food. I haven’t always been like this, maybe the past 2 years or so. I remember I used to not mind chewing, I used to crave food. It’s starting to become a real issue because it takes me forever to get anything done because my life revolves around forcing myself to eat. I don’t not eat, I pretty much snack instead of eat meals because I can’t sit down and enjoy a meal. I can “handle” snacks because it’s only a couple bites I have to force down. When I force myself to eat (everyday) it’s so unpleasant. It sucks to force yourself to eat but I do it because I know I need to eat, I know I can’t skip meals and be healthy. I’m happy with my body and I force myself to eat because I like to stay active and you can’t really be active if you don’t eat.

I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that. Now I can go without social media I’m not like that but that’s how I’d talk to my friends who have my back. My mom cares but just don’t understand.

Hello all, I am a 20 year old with BPD and have restricted for three-ish years. In the first year, I lost \_\_ lbs in 7 months. Then, I kept up the restricting to maintain it and gradually lose even more weight.

A year ago in December, I had wisdom teeth surgery and was on a round of antibiotics. That’s when my GI issues started. I experienced reflux, ibs, bloating, chest pains, nausea, LPR (reflux which affects the vocal chords and upper body/nasal passages), and about a million other symptoms. Stomach pain, burning, belching, indigestion, you name it. We did a million tests. Put me on a million meds. Nothing worked, and my reflux score was through the roof. No SIBO, no H. Pylori, no ulcers, nothing. Except for a small hiatal hernia, that is. I qualified for surgery, and am supposed to get it in a month. However, about 6 months into this whole ordeal, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, and just so happened to start recovery and gaining weight at this time. See the connection?

The GP was initially bad, and while I never threw up, I had bear constant nausea and stomach pains. Then, I followed a low fat, low fiber diet. Up until this point I had literally been limiting myself to one meal of bland chicken and rice a day, believing it to be healing as that’s what all the acid reflux groups told me to do (look up the Acid Watchers Diet- absolute anorexia fuel).

Eventually, my dad realized that I was using this diet as a way to fuel my ED.I was tired and in pain and sick of not eating what I wanted. The kicker was that the diet wasn’t even helping. So now I was miserable AND refluxing daily. So I said fuck it. I may as well eat what I want and deal with the consequences. So I did just that- I ate what I wanted. Chocolate, coffee, pizza, all the bad GERD foods. And it was bad for a bit, but then… it got better. And it just kept getting better the more my restrictions lifted. Every day I tried a new food that I hadn’t touched in years, whether it be due to the ED or low acid diet. And every day, I felt a little better. Now, I have gained \_\_ lbs and eat whatever I want. And I still have occasional nausea and sadly nightly reflux every night (my LES is shit, when I lay down it all comes up no matter what), but Jesus fucking Christ I feel so FREE and GOOD for the first time in forever. That’s great right?

Now my fear: I’m supposed to get a Nissen Fundiplication surgery and hiatal hernia repair in November. It’s supposed to get rid of my reflux for good. The drawbacks, however, are as follows; 3 months of a restricted liquid recovery diet, the inability to ever burp/vomit again, will be restricted against certain foods forever, a high chance that it will CAUSE GASTROPARESIS, a high fail rate after 5 years, and the inability to ever lift more than 50 lbs again.

Look, I know horror stories are everywhere and that I should just ignore them, but I can’t. I’m just stumped, I planned my life around the idea of getting this surgery in November. I postponed school for it. But my dad is terrified that it’s a big mistake, and that restricting will only make things worse again. He says that if I need to get the surgery later in life, to do it, but if my GI issues are manageable now and only getting better to not risk it.

"Hey everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself haven't personally suffered any form of eating disorder so I find it really hard to understand how it impacts someone and their emotions and sense of self - so I'm desperately seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my partner during a time when she had relapsed and was very thin, the usual visible bones and really hollow face

&amp;#x200B;

Since being together I've been really trying to help her with her recovery and encourage her, cook her meals that actually taste amazing so she can find some joy in eating. This has all worked great and she's slowly put weight back on.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm worried because she keep referring to herself as gross and fat etc - when really she just looks like an average human now.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things I can do or say to reassure her that she looks perfectly fine and normal? Are there anything I should avoid saying or do? Are there any behaviours I shouldn't play into?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would massively be appreciated!

This has been an issue for most of my life where I have zero portion control and put a lot more on my plate than I should and still feel hungry afterwards. I’d ask my stepmom if would be okay for me to eat something a few hours after eating dinner and usually she’d say no. My parents would have to make some of my food for me because I didn’t know when too much was too much. My stepmother also made a rule one day where I had to wait for someone to be in the kitchen in order to eat or be anywhere near the kitchen, but this rule never happened.

Me and my parents have argued many times about portion control and Ive gotten grounded before because of it. It’s gotten so bad that I’d steal snacks from other people (my stepmoms room as an example). An example being that one night I was still hungry after eating dinner so I grabbed a donut and took it up to my room, which I didnt think anything of at the time. But now I realize that that was a dumb decision because 1. The donuts are only for breakfast and 2. I took one when I didn’t even know if anyone else had any yet. My stepmom immediately knew that I had took them and this was the conversation:

Stepmom: I know you think you are slick coming down here and taking donuts while I’m in the bathroom! You are ridiculous! You felt the need to take the rest of what was in that box but one half!? You might as well have taken that one too! You don’t listen to anyone! You know you aren’t supposed to be doing that shit!

Me: I took one and I thought that one half was for someone else cause it was only one half.

Stepmom: You had more than one tonight. I don’t care that you want to have more than one donut, but you should have waited until tomorrow.

Stepmom: That’s too much in one night, you have to start having some self control. I hate that I have to hide everything because you can’t control yourself. Everything in moderation girl.

Stepmom: I love you and don’t want to see you have health issues like me. That’s why I get on you.

I don’t really know why I do this. I believe I do it because I’m bored and that food is the only thing that’s really enjoyable to me anymore. I’ve also had an unhealthy diet as a child so that probably makes it worse. But I know that I need to stop doing this, especially considering I’m overweight and barely do any exercise cause I’m afraid of people judging me.

For six+ months I’ve been doing so much better. Today, a friend of mine told me I look like someone (tiktok) famous, who just so happens to be plus size (makeup videos, their body is never even in shot). They’re a beautiful person, and their makeup is amazing, and all of the comments are telling her how beautiful she is, and she is beautiful. But how come after six + months of doing ok, it broke me? I haven’t felt this triggered in so long. I had my first meal at 2pm today after work (unplanned, but something me a year ago would’ve been proud of) and after receiving her message saying I looked like her, I suddenly felt disgustingly guilty about eating as I was about to take my last few bites. I didn’t take them, and now I’m scared about how long this fog will last.

I’ve never been that triggered about anything before during my improvement with food until now. It feels so scary, it feels like I want to hide and not eat and not wear anything nice or do my makeup or see anyone at all. It makes me think about what I was like a year ago, and my brain starts whispering that it’s a good idea, I deserve to go back there, it’s what I need. I know it’s not right, I know my brain is horrible for thinking these things not just about myself, but for it thinking the person I apparently look like is a negative way to look.

She really wanted to come to school this year and has a meal plan etc. Everything seemed to be going good but recently she’s started to push me away.

"Hi all! I have struggled with anorexia for the past year and a half, and just recently decided to get some help.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now being followed by a nutritionist who gave me a weekly meal plan to follow: I went from eating very very little, tirelessly exercising, to following a balanced and satisfying meal plan, not really exercising besides some light walking (I was advised not to exercise heavily because we're trying to get my period back). My main problem right now, though, is: snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I used not to have them before (not for lack of hunger, of course) but my nutritionist added them to the plan, and while the first few days went somewhat good (my body was a bit confused because my hunger signals are completely fucked up right now, and I didn't know whether I was hungry or not, whether I wanted more food or not, etc.), the past few ones have been odd.

&amp;#x200B;

After I eat my snack, I get this incredible energy crash where I feel completely low, irritable, sleepy and am unsure whether I am getting 'about to faint' signals from my body. It doesnt really happen after my meals though, so it must be something tied to the snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how normal this is, I mean I'm thinking it might have something to do with my metabolism suddenly getting all this energy that it was lacking before, and using it all up, but I don't know. My weight (in the low-healthy range) has been somewhat stable for now, it's a little bit less than what it was when I was last visited by my nutritionist, but less than half a lb. I'm trying to follow my meal plan as best as I can, although it's not always easy as you all know.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced something similar in recovery? I will of course speak to my nutritionist about it, but I first wanted to know whether it was a scary scary issue or somewhat normal o.O

"A bit of background, I’ve struggled with a restrictive ED for about ten years now; things have been up and down but things were actually going pretty well for me up until recently. I had to attend an occupational health meeting for my new job a few months ago (I am a doctor myself) just to go through my medical history and my ED was brought up. I definitely got the impression that the doctor seeing me had a slight judgmental tone (if not a bit disapproving); although I’m used to it, as I’ve had bad experiences as a patient when doctors/health professionals find out I’m a doctor struggling with ED. She then asked about all my ED behaviours in detail, which I felt extremely uncomfortable talking about as she was a complete stranger and even with therapists it takes some time to open up. She weighed me as well, which I suffer a lot of anxiety from and have not done so in a long time. After all that, she kind of ‘lectured’ (?) me about how I need to maintain a ‘healthy’ weight and if I lost too much weight then they would have to remove me from my job and I couldn’t return to work until I’d recovered my weight, plus another few months on top of that.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I think today I’ve reached my breaking point/ break through of realizing where I am at and it’s been sudden and I am very confused. I want to schedule a check up with a doctor in the next week and be proactive, but I’m just so confused at the same time of how I got here.

I didn’t ever have a problem with my weight and I’ve never hated it, barely thought about it, but things happened so fast and it feels like I hadn’t even realized it. So that’s kinda why I’m confused if I have an ED.

I have been around an average weight most of my life. 2-3 years ago I was slightly overweight due to a medical condition which I gained that weight in 3 months, then lost the same amount of weight in three months due to medication (doctors told me it was water weight/ inflation from the medication). But even then, I never really put much thought into my weight or appearance.

After that year, I’ve maintained my average healthy weight until very recently and I don’t know why but it went unnoticed. The last time I weighed myself four months ago, I was exactly my healthy weight. Since the pandemic started I’ve just been wearing sweats, hoodies, not putting much effort because I just wanted to be comfortable because I am staying home. My family and friends I see on a daily had not made any comments on my appearance either, I’m guessing since they see me everyday, they don’t notice subtle changes.

But it was yesterday that I met up with friends I hadn’t seen in a year. And the first thing, and the only thing they brought up was “you lost so much weight, your cheekbones are so prominent, you look like a model with that jawline” and questions along those lines.

And that is when I became self conscious, confused, all of the emotions basically. I didn’t have a problem with being an average weight for my height. And now it’s just making me reflect on my body more. My diet has remained the same, in fact I am eating more than I had before, I am exercising way less too. So I’m just in a confused state.

Today, I finally weighed myself. I am very underweight. I haven’t been this weight since I was in elementary school ten years ago. I took my hoodie and sweats off and looked at myself in the mirror. I put my hands around my waist and my fingertips are a few inches from touching each other. I broke down.

I want to be proactive health wise because I know this weight can be dangerous so I am scheduling an appointment because I haven’t changed any sleep, food, or exercise habits, and my mood was happier than ever so I do have underlying health concerns.

But I am here on this subreddit because psychologically, I am just confused, panicked, I don’t know what to do because I don’t know how I got here in such little time. Is this an ED, do I have BD? I know I need to get medical help but will they also provide me with therapeutic help? Has anyone else ever been through this? I don’t know, I have so many questions and no one to really talk about it at the moment because the people I see everyday haven’t noticed change, and the people I haven’t seen in a year, are trying to romanticize it even though I think it’s not good.",,Request: I’ve reached my breaking point,2,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pwq4rm,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pwq4rm/request_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pwq4rm/request_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/,1632775425,595,0,0,0,-1,1,"Sudden and unexplained weight loss, potential underlying health concerns",neutral,"['The writer is experiencing confusion and panic related to their sudden weight loss and changes in body image', 'They are seeking medical help to address potential health concerns', 'They are uncertain whether they have an eating disorder or body dysmorphia', 'They are looking for guidance and support through therapy']","Sudden weight loss, comments from friends regarding appearance",harmful,"['Becoming self-conscious and confused about body image', 'Becoming underweight', 'Psychological distress and confusion']",Sudden weight loss and confusion about the cause,neutral,"['Feeling self-conscious and panicky about sudden weight loss', 'Becoming underweight without realizing it', 'Seeking proactive health care and medical help', 'Feeling confused about whether this is an ED or BD, and needing therapeutic help']",,
"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I had anorexia from age 10-15 and have slowly been recovering. I've been able to have 3 meals a day (sometimes more) and enjoy eating for about a year now, with a few periods of restriction. I never really used to exercise excessively, and after I became anaemic I stopped any form of exercise. A few years ago I tried exercising and it resulted in me counting calories and losing weight. Last year I tried again, when I was experiencing some bad body issues, and I would just cry every time I exercised because my intention was to make my body look ""better"". Whenever I lose a bit of weight I get very self conscious, because I feel I look as ""bad"" as I did when I had an ED, even though you can barely see a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm satisfied with my body and weight now, I don't really look at my body and I rarely check my weight which is good progress for me. I would like to be a bit stronger and feel healthier. I have some form of heart condition (waiting for a diagnosis). I'm not particularly fit and I get tired very easily as well. I know exercise won't fix my heart condition but I think it would help me to feel better physically.

"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in ED recovery, used to suffer from binging and purging. I have learned about how my body expresses its needs to me and how to recognize true versus fake hunger (true hunger being the physical feeling of hunger; fake hunger being a craving for a specific food, for example chocolate, unaccompanied by an actual feeling of physical hunger). I was wondering how people deal with this fake hunger, since I recognize that succumbing to it will not satisfy the fake hunger and will make me physically uncomfortable since I will be way too full.

"I've been trying different antidepressants for over a year now and my doctor just prescribed me mirtazapine which is known to slow one's metabolism and cause weight gain. I finally reached a healthy weight about two years ago after struggling with anorexia for over a decade.

I've taken this medication before for sleep and it absolutely raised my appetite and I gained weight quickly.

So, between the ages of 15-19ish I struggled with an undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder. As far as physical symptoms go, it never got that severe, but it was extremely mentally taxing, as it consumed a majority of my daily thoughts. Eventually, the obsession with it subsided as I got more determined to recover for the sake of my future family.

Fast forward to several years later, and I'm living off of my savings in college, besides a small income from a part-time minimum wage job. I had all these plans for what I wanted to cook and eat for myself in college so I could eat healthier (meaning, actually eating fruits and veggies on a daily basis and skipping the ramen). But sticker shock quickly set in; combine that with anxiety about my financial future, laziness from depression and schoolwork, and I've headed the opposite direction. I find myself avoiding buying food under any circumstance. I avoid going to the grocery store, I avoid going out to eat, I feel good every time I skip a meal because I think of the money I'm saving.

However, I haven't started eating more, despite having less reason not to. My parents are kind enough that they're now giving me $20 a week for food. I find myself feeling unreasonably guilty about eating my boyfriend's food. And besides, I'm rarely in the mood to eat, especially if I'm really hungry. Occasionally, I just feel a general fear of eating food.

But it's not like I'm afraid of getting fat, like before. I rather wish I were more muscular and curvier. Although I will admit that, deep down, very specific things like seeing a bigger number on a scale, or pants feeling tighter trigger me.

Is this an eating disorder? If you have any coping strategies or directions I can pursue out of this, that would be great.

Hey everyone, I tried to find something on this but I couldn’t find any so I’m sorry if this has been asked before.

I (m18) struggle to eat, I’m not sure if it counts as an eating disorder but I do count calories and sometimes skip meals. My friend (m18) has just told me that he is also struggling with eating, from what he has told me it is very similar to mine. So I have a few questions:

Q: I know that there are many different forms of ED and not everyone fits a label, but does what I described count as an Ed?

Q: Should I tell him about me as well? No one knows about my issues with eating, I have just been dealing with it on my own, I’m worried that if I tell him about mine it will be too much for him.

Q: How do I help him out? I have been there as much as I can for him but I don’t know what to say or do as to not trigger him, I’m just really worried about him.

Hello,

Recently I haven't been eating all that much. I've definitely lost weight, and although that is a good thing as I am overweight, I don't think its happening in a healthy way. You see, I recently started my second year at college. Last year I had similar eating issues, as I had found going to the cafeteria to be exhausting and a drag on my day, so eventually I kinda just stopped going unless I absolutely had to eat something. This year its kind of the same, except I'm eating even less and I've developed this anxiety, almost like a sense of dread, that comes on when I think about having a full meal. Even when I do challenge that anxiety and go to the caf to get some food (since I know I need to eat), I find it difficult to actually get a solid amount of food down. Every single time there's always something left on my plate, and although I want to eat it, I simply can't. Today, I couldn't even finish one piece of lasagna. It tasted fine, but getting it down made me feel like I was going to throw up.

I feel like this lack of eating is leading to brain fog and a general feeling of low energy, and I don't know what to do about it. I want to eat more, but my body isn't agreeing. I also have this weird feeling in my stomach that happens when I'm hungry but it feels so odd that if anything it makes me not want to put anything in my stomach over fear I might chuck it all up. I don't really know what to do anymore and I'm starting to get really worried about this. Its stressing me out a lot. Has anyone else here had symptoms like this? Do you know what to do about it?

Also as a sidenote I am bipolar type two and have been in therapy for many years, am on medication to control mania and depression aswell as insomnia, and I smoke weed daily, usually to relax and go to sleep.

Hi,

 My mother has struggled with disorder eating for as long as I can remember. As for myself, I have been struggling with maintaining a healthy weight due to anxiety and OCD for the past 2 years.

I have been noticing she stares at my body when I talk to her lately. It makes me very uncomfortable. To the point that I deliberately cover up in really baggy clothes if I’m going to be interacting with her. I’ve brought it up with her, but she denies she does it. However, the last time I said something along the lines of “please stop looking at my body” she said that I had a “beautiful body”.

I don’t think I still have an ED, or at least it’s not as consistent as it used to be, but there’s something I am still struggling with. I feel intense guilt pretty often, usually from anxiety or depression, and every time I get this feeling I feel the need to punish myself by restricting my food. I’m totally aware that I’m doing it but my fiancé hasn’t noticed in all the time that we’ve been together that I do it. I desperately want to tell him what I’m doing so that maybe he can help but every time I try I choke and physically cannot force the words out of my mouth. It’s the same when I try to tell anyone else and it’s scaring me. I also don’t feel like this is his burden to have to share with me and the fact that I want him to help me just adds to my guilt.

BF says he’s stopped purging but his self hatred and body dysmorphia is still so bad. And it’s honestly ruining my self esteem because I’ve slightly curvy and he’s almost skin and bones and talks about his stomach and thigh gap and it’s getting in my head. He tells me I’m perfect but still I’ve started monitoring my weight and started a diet because the things he says he hates about himself are on my body not his.

Additionally his self hatred making complimenting him or telling him I love him impossible. He will respond “how could you love this fat piece of shit?” So ive started saying it less. I’ve told him I don’t like when he does this because it comes off like he’s trying to convince me I shouldnt find him attractive and him trying to convince me I shouldn’t love him. And he ignores it and doesn’t even consider it

I’ve talked to him about talking to someone before and he refuses and said “therapists are for people who insane” and he didn’t like me saying he needed to see a shrink.

But now that I can’t say I love you to him and I’m starting to have a worse self esteem I need him to get help. So how do I say “get help or our relationship will end if you don’t” without that ultimatum because honestly it’s hurting me so much to hear him talk about himself like that and it’s hurting me to watch him still monitor his weight and skip meals and he says he’s better because he says he not purging anymore but he still thinks he needs to lose another 15 lbs but I’ve told him if he does he will have to get medical help he will be too skinny",,Request: BFs self hatred is ruining our relationship,13,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,prrqnu,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/prrqnu/request_bfs_self_hatred_is_ruining_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/prrqnu/request_bfs_self_hatred_is_ruining_our/,1632132265,301,0,0,0,-1,1,Body dysmorphia and self-hatred being expressed by boyfriend,harmful,"['Girlfriend is becoming self-conscious and has started monitoring her weight and dieting', ""Boyfriend's self-hatred makes it difficult for him to accept compliments or affection"", 'Boyfriend has refused to see a therapist despite girlfriend expressing concern', 'Girlfriend feels the need to give an ultimatum about getting help in order to save the relationship']",,,,,,,1832.0,

"For starters, I was diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. I don't know if that info will be of benefit in knowing but my confusion around eating hasn't really been in the forefront of my mind. Until the other day. I had a breakdown because the store didn't have my white castle cheeseburgers. Looking back now, my appetite is and always has been weird/wanky. The white castle burgers is what I've been eating for the last couple of months, nearly everyday w/ my cup of cereal for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I do this with different foods all the time. I eat a specific food until I absolutely can't anymore. When the food that I am hungry for is not available, I break down. I can't just get in the pantry and easily grab/make something else. My brain simply doesn't work that way for.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: It may seem weird but I really don't consider myself to be a picky eater per se on what foods I actually like. I love just about every veggie out there and every meat source. I don't eat raw foods i.e. sushi. Besides that my variety seems endless.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this last food ""episode"" made me conscious that this is Not the first time I had a breakdown over food like this. The amount of mental work it takes to figure out what my body will accept to eat is quite concerning. I try so hard to work my appetite up, and sometimes to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

More often than not, thinking of certain foods make me feel gaggy and nauseous and I'd rather not eat at all. I push something down anyway in those instances because I know my body needs nourishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I do struggle w/ self esteem issues and C-PTSD but not really anything to do with my weight though. When I eat THC, I could eat anything under the sun. It ramps up my appetite and sometimes a little too much blood sugar wise (I'm also diabetic and have other health issues than what's been previously listed above) I don't want to depend on getting it in order to be able to eat. It's pricey and I can't really afford it nor want to be high all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: I don't and never have binged/purged. I have No want to. I'm not on a specific hardcore diet. I don't do calorie deficits or any type of fasting trends. I rarely ever drink a diet soda/caffeine. I don't eat out often. Stick to water or milk. I don't have an unhealthy relationship w/ candy-sweets.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for support and if anyone has a similar experience with this whole eating sitch.

"Hi everyone, I didn't know where to write or even if i should meddle in this. Anyway, here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a cousin who came to study in the same city as us last year. He comes to visit very often and is currently staying with us for some weeks. My boyfriends family always referred to him as thin, but he is severely underweight and sickly looking. I mean i was taken aback the first time i saw him, i thought he might have some kind of health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i started suspecting he might have an ED when i noticed how much he would say he is eating. Like in any random conversation with him he would say that a day before he ate this and that (lists about xxx kcal worth of food - a large amount). Without me asking or without the topic being about food. Are random lies about food consumption a symptom of an ED?

&amp;#x200B;

Every time he comes to visit he is always about to faint and is physically very weak (as in he struggles to hold even his bags). When i ask him if he has eaten anything and to make dinner, he will reply that on that specific day he was very busy and then will proceed to mention how much he had eaten the other days.

&amp;#x200B;

And now since he is staying with us i noticed that when we sit down to eat he will have at least one glass of water before eating, 2-3 during food and one after. And then he goes to the bathroom afterwards. I might be imagining things, but i thought he might be throwing up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if i should even bring this up, it's probably none of my business, should i say anything to him or even what i should say. I have no clue how to approach this. Even if he doesn't have an ED, being as skinny as he is and not eating until the point a person feels nauseous isn't healthy.

"I dealt with bulimia and anorexia for eight years and ultimately recovered two years ago (I’ve been doing great except for the occasional triggers). A year and a half ago, I decided to cut out fast food from my diet just to be healthier, which has been amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the blue, about a year ago, my weight started fluctuating more than usual. I figured it was maybe due to cutting out the fast food and didn’t pay it much mind until 6 months ago when it was dropping pretty rapidly. At this time, I was trying to put on muscle, so this was frustrating for me. For my entire life, I’ve never really eaten much (I look back on my childhood and see a lot of disordered eating habits that I never noticed that fueled my ED later in life), but at the time I was trying to put on muscle, I was eating normal, regularly scheduled meals.

I saw my doctor and got blood work done which came back perfect. I genuinely thought I was going to see thyroid issues or SOMETHING.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had history of having a funny relationship with food and I feel it's all catching up with me now.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child I used to eat a lot of food and never gain the weight from it, on my dads side they'd tease me for how much I ate and would offer me more food when I'd finish and sort of... let other families know I was a big eater. On my mums side my mum would worry I would get diabetes and my sisters would call me fat for what I'd eat even though I wasn't physically, even my friends at school would give me names such as ""fatass"" because of how I'd eat! as i got older my appetite died down a lot, to the point I could only manage 1 meal a day but there wasn't really any extra thought to it, I just couldn't manage to eat more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

However people started to notice I was losing weight and I started to notice too, my mum asked if I was starving myself and at that time I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

The sudden weight loss was a worry at first, I thought it was a sign of cancer or something? but after receiving a lot of compliments on my figure and how slim I was I started to enjoy it and kept up with measuring and weighing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It came to a point where I was almost underweight, I become almost obsessive over how I looked and how much I weighed and I still am, however through covid things seemed to decline and I started using food as a sort of... punishment? I wouldn't eat all day if I hadn't done something ""worthy"" of it, now what makes me question if this is an eating disorder or not is because I'd also restrict myself on when I could go to the toilet, if I was ""worthy"" enough to go.

&amp;#x200B;

But as time goes on I'm still obsessed with how I look and my weight, I'm about to buy scales and I've made a goal for myself to actually hit that underweight mark, I almost brag to people that I'm almost there? I know it's not great and I'm the only one proud of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilt when I do eat heavy things like an actual meal, I can't even remember my last proper meal? I have a tenancy to binge on junk foods and sugary snacks at nighttime too when everyone is asleep, I still feel guilty and hate myself for it in the morning. But there are times where I can eat fine through the day and not feel guilty, times where I go out my way to eat? but I always come back to the restrictive eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Today just for example all I ate was a few yogurts and I felt really proud of myself for it, I felt hunger pains and felt accomplished by it?

&amp;#x200B;

To summarise, I've made a goal to become underweight, I feel immense guilt when I eat but sometimes I'm okay with eating, I use food as a threat to myself (if I feel like a failure I will starve myself), I binge at night when no one can see me eating junk.

i’m a 16 year old female who is at a normal weight. i’ve never had a strict diet when it comes to eating, i’d usually just snack whenever and eat lunch my school served and dinner when my mom cooks it.

3 months ago my mom got sick and hasn’t been able to do much so i have been fending for myself. before school started i would usually eat a small snack like half a bag of doritos or maybe a muffin for the entire day. i could never find an appetite. when school started i’d eat breakfast (just a biscuit) and lunch which was a sandwich. when i get home i don’t eat.

this gets to my point. am i just lazy or is this the beginning of an eating disorder? i hate cooking but i dont hate eating. if someone bought me mcdonald’s when i got home id rightfully eat it up, or if my mom cooked me dinner i would eat that. but i never have enough motivation or energy to cook or really do anything. i spend 7 hours of my day on no food everyday. i feel myself being hungry and i know that’s not healthy but i really have no energy to cook.",,Request: Do I have an eating disorder or am I just lazy?,4,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,ppqj1m,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ppqj1m/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_am_i_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ppqj1m/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_am_i_just/,1631842081,209,0,0,0,-1,1,Lack of appetite and motivation to cook due to taking care of sick mother,unknown,"['Only eating small snacks or a sandwich for the day', 'Feeling hungry but not having the energy to cook', 'Not meeting daily nutritional requirements']","Having to fend for oneself due to a sick mother, lack of appetite, lack of motivation/energy to cook",unknown,"['Skipping meals and only eating small snacks throughout the day', 'Feeling hungry but too unmotivated to cook or do anything', 'Questioning if this behavior is the beginning of an eating disorder']",Decreased appetite due to family crisis and increased responsibilities for cooking,neutral,"['Eating less food throughout the day, struggling to find an appetite even when hungry', 'Losing motivation and energy to cook']",1845.0,

First of all, I want to apologize if I unintentionally trivialize anyone’s experience or display any ignorance/insensitivity for eating disorders or someone’s specific circumstances. A firm trigger warning for starvation, major weight loss and weight gain, medication abuse, and a pretty in-depth description of what’s going on in my mind.

This is the first time I’m ever talking about any of this, like, ever, since I bury it in a deep and shameful part of my conscience, so I apologize if this is a bit of a vent. When I was in middle school (I am now a uni student), I was overweight. It wasn’t significant and I never had a problem with it — in fact, I never even noticed it. However, I was living with my very abusive mother who essentially bribed me to lose weight (I won’t get into specifics but by ‘lose weight’ I don’t mean a healthy amount). With a combination of her encouragement and mental abuse, I lost… a lot of weight really fast. I went from being a bit overweight to quite underweight. This was mostly all from just not eating. I honestly don’t remember it — it’s a blur, but even though I was never weight-conscious before this, I felt quite good afterwards. I never thought anything of it despite a few concerned comments from those who knew me.

I maintained my middle school weight for a while, occasionally gaining some and losing some, but generally staying in the same range. Over a year ago, shortly after the initial quarantine, I gained all of that weight back and then some without even really noticing. But there was one day I suddenly became aware of the feeling of my thighs rubbing against each other… and this completely set me off. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It has consumed me.

Now I am obsessed with weight. It is always on my mind no matter what I’m doing. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone — I’ll compare myself to any random person on the street without being able to control my thoughts. I compare myself to my boyfriend and he’s significantly taller than me and a male, but I still do it. I can’t stop looking at photos of other people and old photos of myself. I can’t wear more than half of my clothes because they don’t fit in a very particular way. I don’t seem to have the restraint I did in middle school regarding food and I’ve been stuck in a miserable cycle of eating, despising myself for it and promising to stop, then caving in and eating again. I can’t stop obsessing over how appalling I feel in my own body and it’s made me extremely, extremely depressed and has become my number one preoccupation. This past year and a half has sent me into a downward spiral and after not losing weight due to my constant relapsing, I’ve started to abuse my ADHD medication.

I guess my question, as pathetic as it seems, is: could this be an eating disorder or am I just insecure?

For context, I am 19F living with my mum, with 2 older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. My mum does the grocery shopping, although me and my older sisters do pay some rent, and the four of us take turns making dinner.

On a couple of nights in a row, I found myself not particularly hungry during dinner and about halfway into my food I would feel full and slightly sick. I was sad because these were meals that I really enjoyed and made me feel really guilty about wasting my food. I started to avoid eating during the day so that I would be hungry for dinner and not waste the meal someone made for me.

At the same time, I also started feeling very depressed due to COVID lockdowns in my area and found a lot of my favourite snacks didn't taste good anymore so I eat a lot less than I did a couple of months ago. I never really eating a proper breakfast or lunch either but that is more about laziness over not wanting to prepare something for myself.

Do I have a problem? I always assumed that eating disorders were rooted more in body image or self-esteem so I don't know if what I'm experiencing should warrant concern.

I'll start by repeating that I cannot afford to see a doctor until I  have insurance (10/26). I am currently supporting myself and my fiancee  (disabled, absolutely cannot work) on $15/hr working full time at a  well-known big box store.

MtF transgender (technically fluid but further info here is  irrelevant), 4.5 consecutive years on HRT. weight fluctuates all over  the place, up or down around a third of my body weight in a matter of 3  months feels almost normal to me, lately. For the last month or slightly  longer, I've had an issue that has progressively worsened. I seem to be  unable to eat anything and keep the entire meal down. Maybe the first  two or three bites are fine, but even a sandwich is too much for me most  of the time. I don't feel particularly stressed, but I do feel like I'm  kind of fat, despite being largely a healthy weight for my frame, and  only looking overweight in my belly area. The thought of stepping on a  scale and seeing that I have lost weight, even a half pound, makes me  feel elated. I tell people I am fat when they mention food or clothing,  and they look at me like ""girl you crazy."" wanna weigh a number that I  know isn't a healthy number for myself.

I'm frankly, afraid to put food in myself and force it down only for  it to come up about 45 minutes later. I'd like to check into a rehab  clinic but I don't have the money nor the credit to do so, and I'll have  insurance in \~45 days. can't decide if I need to check in sooner or not.

Does it count as an eating disorder if I eat quite a  lot during my normal periods and then undereat when I have anxiety,  possibly depression (or just sadness, hopelesness)?

I willingly lost quite a lot of weight last summer-autumn and went  from higher overweight to lower healthy, but since then i've been  maintaining my weight in a quite unusual (or maybe common idk) way,  which I don't do on purpose. I overeat when i am feeling  relaxed/happy/usual, and then I undereat when i am stressed. I may even  skip several meals when I am especially anxious or just depressed. I do  have body image issues but almost never is my stress caused by me  wanting to lose or control my weight.

I've struggled with food for a while. I was a chubby  kid, and I used to always wish I could just stop eating. I'd tell myself  I wouldn't eat, or I'd only eat one meal a day, but it never became a  consistent thing. There was a period of time a few months ago where I  was broke, I couldn't afford any food, so I stopped eating often. I'd go  a day or two at a time without eating, because I had to make what I had  last. During that time I lost a lot of weight, and people noticed.  Things have gotten better, and I have a wonderful boyfriend who cooks me  delicious dinners that I will eat, but most days that's it. I won't eat  anything else except for maybe a granola bar. Part of it is executive  dysfunction, but I can't deny that a part of me is afraid of gaining the  weight back, and that I don't deserve to eat. And I had the thought  today, that I don't have an eating disorder, I'm just choosing not to  eat.

I have read a lot about EDs trying to see what is  happening to me and I would come to a conclusion that in the past 3  years I suffered from bulimia, orthorexia, body dysmorphia, anorexia and  overeating. The main reason I developed it is because I started with a  strict gym regime where I lost a lot of weight. I tried to stay on that  weight (which now looking back was too low) and that’s where the problem  was. Also, my perception of food was (and still is) totally distorted.  It was then when I started purging the meals that I didn’t perceive as  “clean”. Later that developed into a full blown overeating and purging  period and I gained all the lost weight back plus more. I felt miserable  with myself for years. 

Recently, I lost the weight again in a very unhealthy way by mostly  starving myself, overtraining and purging. For the past month I’ve been  overeating most of the days, since I guess my body was starving and I  gained some of the weight back, as well as the feeling of misery. When I  do this, I buy all the “bad” food that I can find, come home and stuff  myself with it until I fall asleep or can’t breathe anymore. Then I fall  asleep and purge when I wake up. I rarely eat a proper healthy meal,  but I always tell myself that I will. Then I decide not to eat for a  whole day as a restriction and at one point I start starving and I buy  unhealthy food again. And that’s the circle I am in… 

My main problem is that I noticed how this is starting to seriously  effect other fields of my life. I am often depressed but right now  mostly numb to everything, I can’t remember when was the last time I was  happy and laughing, I avoid social events, I don’t eat with other  people, I get foggy brain and I feel cold when I starve myself, I can’t  sleep if I completely don’t stuff myself and my perception of myself is  based solely on how I look and with that also my mood. I only feel  satisfied with my body when I look like a undeveloped girl and it  bothers me when my breast start to show.  I really don’t want to go through those “miserable years” again and I  want to start with my recovery. I have been trying to figure out this by  myself, since seeking professional help is too expensive for me. I  haven’t told my parents or my friends, but they’ve noticed that I have  phases, either underweight or overweight, also I think this is a very  sensitive topic so nobody directly asked me anything and I always made  some kind of excuses for my unusual eating patterns. 

I just want to be happy and normal again and I would appreciate any kind of advice I can get.

Hi, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I’ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.

I’ve noticed one thing in particular that triggers me that I can’t  find info about is whenever I find out about someone who has experienced  addiction, I immediately want to open up to them but don’t, and instead  go into a tailspin of ideas and old habits.

Does this happen to anyone else? Does opening up to them help? I’m  wondering if this is a better approach for me. So many people don’t see  the connection between an eating disorder and, say, alcoholism, and I  would love not to get triggered by someone’s recovery journey even if  it’s not an eating disorder.

My friend of 5+ years who I've known since I was 15 is really worrying me. I'll need to give some context because this is a long story, but I can't just sit and watch what's going on anymore.

He is 25 and about 6'0"" tall. He is very skinny, it is very noticeable when he wears tighter clothing like jeans. Sometimes when he's bad, I can see his skeleton on his chest and his face - his eyes get dark around the sockets and he complains of fatigue and bad moods (could also be job related, he is a hard worker, but runs on fumes and energy drinks to get him through the week).

We've lived together with a few other friends of ours in a house we rent for the past 3 years. I tried to put the idea forward of buying our groceries together weekly and that we could take it in turns cooking a meal every night for each other,  like a family.

Nobody fancied this idea and we just cook for ourselves and occasionally if I make too much I will split my meal in half for one of the other lads. Sometimes I make extra for my friend because he has no food to eat.

This is where the problem is, he doesn't cook at all and never buys proper quantities of food to eat. I don't think I have seen him prepare a proper meal even 10 times in the past 3 years we've been here. He lives on instant noodles, beans and bacon, with toast clumped in butter. Energy drinks and cigarettes. Amd his favourite, takeout Pizza.

Now for the serious part. Just a few months we were in the kitchen and I was cooking me and him dinner, when mid conversation his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed in front of me. Luckily I caught him and his head before he could hit the floor. After he woke up, he was totally out of it and had no idea of what had just happened. I urged him many a time to go get checked by his GP,  but he hasn't done anything!

On top of this, due to him only spending his wage on expensive takeout pizza/burgers, daily energy drinks, noodles, tobacco and sugary snacks, he is coming short and having to borrow money from me to buy food, but it's all going straight on takeout again.

I'm no nutrition expert but this diet is a recipe for disaster. Not only does he never eat vegetables or fruit, but he doesn't get enough protein or calories to sustain the body of a 25 year old man.

He says every time he will do a proper food shop but he never does, and later that night or the next day it'll be more takeout again... I feel like I'm helping my best friend commit suicide!

How can I help him? Not only is he physically being ruined by this, but mentally he appears to be deteriorating too.

I don't know who to speak to about this because I don't want to seem like I'm obsessing over his life choices, but after knowing the guy for so long and seeing him in clear decline, I think I would be a horrible friend to not try and help him.

I don't think he even knows he has some kind of eating disorder, he seems to just think its normal when it's not.

Please let me know your thoughts and share any advise you have, I want to try and make an effort with him because we look after each other here, but he can't even look after himself and it make me so sad.",,Request: I'm watching my best friend destroy himself!,24,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,plhuol,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/plhuol/request_im_watching_my_best_friend_destroy_himself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/plhuol/request_im_watching_my_best_friend_destroy_himself/,1631267229,626,0,0,0,-1,1,Friend's poor diet and lack of proper meals,harmful,"['Physical symptoms, such as fatigue and bad moods, as well as a collapse at one point', 'Mental decline and potential eating disorder', 'Borrowing money for takeout and failing to buy proper groceries', 'Reluctance to seek medical help', 'Lack of nutrients and calories needed to sustain a 25-year-old man']",Friend has a poor diet and unhealthy eating habits,harmful,"['Is physically and mentally deteriorating due to his eating habits', 'Is borrowing money for food, but is still spending it on unhealthy takeout', 'Has collapsed and had a potential medical emergency in the past', 'Seems to be unaware or in denial about his eating disorder']","Eating an unhealthy diet consisting of instant noodles, takeout food, and sugary snacks, financial difficulties, collapse due to malnourishment",harmful,"['Friend is physically and mentally deteriorating due to malnourishment and a lack of proper nutrition', 'Friend is in financial trouble due to spending money on unhealthy food choices', 'Friend collapsed due to malnourishment', 'Writer is concerned for their friend and wants to help']",1868.0,EatingDisorders

"I have struggled with eating since my mid teens, I am 22 (m) now. I’ve struggled with multiple eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, BED. For the greater part of my ED history, I have had the most difficulty with anorexia. At the moment I find myself cycling through all of them: very low cal diet as long as I can while exercising &gt; eventual failure persisted by binge eating leading to intense workouts from post binge guilt. Repeat. Throughout the years, it has never become a severe physical health risk, but I’m quite sure it contributed to the permanent digestive issues that I now have and am medicated for. On the other hand, it has been a never ending torment to my mental health. Within the past 2 years, it has consumed most of my day to day life.

There have been times where I’ve managed to maintain a healthy eating regimen, but it never lasts. Funnily enough, I feel the most in control when successfully maintaining an eating disorder; it evokes a rewarding feeling. The days in which I’m unsuccessful in my ED ambitions, I feel worthless and shameful. I’m constantly keeping track of certain dates to gauge how I should eat in the following weeks, or, pushing back/cancelling plans if I’m not yet satisfied with my self imposed eating boot camp, if you will.

I've been in recovery for six years, but relapsed a few months ago. I've never been diagnosed or treated even though I had some pretty significant health impacts. I had three young children at the time, and was embarrassed of my eating disorder so I never sought help. I've managed pretty well until now. I honestly did not think I would ever be engaging in ED behaviors again, but after losing my mom last year, relationship issues, and my youngest having some pretty significant ongoing medical issues I started using it as a coping mechanism and it snowballed from there.

Every single part of me just wants this to quietly go away. The logical part of my brain is screaming at me. I'm in my 30's now, my oldest is 13 not 7, I feel like I've lost every reasonable part of me. I did this before on my own, but I'm really struggling right now. I don't think I want to give up my way of coping, but I recognize the damage I'm doing.

Anyways, we're back to the embarrassment/shame. I live in a small community, I have insurance but no primary physician because I've never been able to make an appointment for a checkup. I don't have a support network outside of the wonderful support system of therapists/teachers for my kiddos.

First of all sorry if what I'm about to say trivializes your real struggles in any way, I don't want to compare my experience to an actual disorder but I'm afraid I may be at the beginning of *something*

First of all, I'm a 29 year-old woman. I don't think any woman in our society has a completely healthy and happy relationship with food and her body but I don't think mine has been especially bad up to this point. I do have bouts of depression related to childhood trauma, and whenever an episode is about to come up I tend to be more uneasy in and critical of my body. I had one of those bouts of depression this summer and really lacked appetite for 2 months. I got better for a short while, started eating again and felt a little bad about getting back to the healthy weight I had been at previously.

Now I'm feeling myself slip into a bad place again, but it's a lot more body and food-focused than it's ever been. I somehow know that my brain is trying to distract me from the trauma and anxiety by dumping all of its attention on calories and the way my thighs look, but I also can't stop thinking about it. This morning I almost panicked in my kitchen at the thought of having some oatmeal. I've never had such a violet reaction at the thought of eating and I'm really worried.

I'm thinking of starting therapy and working through all of this with a professional but I'd like some advice, reassurance, first-hand experience, anything really that you may deem helpful.

"Recently, I have been wondering if I have an eating disorder. Since  March, I lost a lot of weight without noticing, which started a spiral of working out and eating “right”.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat an average of xxx calories (very low) a day in one meal. Oftentimes much less, and a lot of times what I am taking in is from drinks, not food. I won’t touch soda or dessert at all, and I will obsessively monitor how many calories are in my food so I can decide how much of it I want to eat. Part of it is I’m only hungry for a little, but part of it is deliberate. I have panic attacks when I see how many calories are in restaurant dishes. I often order a small house salad and pick around the cheese and croutons and dress it in lemon juice and pepper or nothing at all. I absolutely will not eat if someone else is not, to the point of starving myself because my partner is not hungry, or whomever I’ve gone out to dinner with just wants to grab drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost even more weight, but it is considered overweight BMI apparently, so no doctor will believe that I have an eating disorder. I tried detailing how quickly I lost so much weight and my relationship with food, but since I’m overweight and actively dieting, doctors just keep telling me that’s the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don’t have a problem- maybe it’s all fine. Most of the people in my life brush off my concerns because “everyone feels that way when they’re dieting”. But I don’t think they do. And if they do, I don’t know why anyone would do it. I spend all day obsessing about what and how much I ate and punishing myself if I miss my workout (I hurt my knee really badly pushing myself to keep running after injured it, for one.) I’m miserable most of the time, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Even if I’m hungry.

Recently i spent maybe a week of very low/little to no eating at all at and it may be the stupidest thing ive done in a while. I dont feel hungry, just sick, i try to eat, i vomit, its to the point where my body is trying to vomit but there is simply nothing there.

Due to advice from my older brother ive cut down on weed although havent stopped smoking it altogether.

How do i get back on track? Force feeding? Liquid meals? Im trying to fix it but I cant seem to find the way i wake up unbelievably tired and dont ""wake up"" until its time to sleep.

Im in a foreign country so seeing a doctor is pretty daunting, but im registered with the national healthcare system so it could be an option but if i can fix it from home i will.

"Bit of back story; back in June I was hospitalized after a teacher at school had to get someone to pick me up because they were really concerned, and a a blood test revealed that my phosphate was dangerously low, alongside my potassium, iron and blood sugar... all that fun stuff. It was there that I was actually diagnosed with anorexia- I've denied (and continue to deny) that anything is wrong when literally everyone, myself included knows that, that most definitely isn't the case. After finally being discharged I was kinda forced into recovery... I know I sound ungrateful, I truly am so lucky to have so much support and love, but in all honesty I wish it would just stop. I hate the attention that it's brought to me, I hate that people are almost babying me now. It's like everyone around me is walking on eggshells, being EXTRA nice to the point that it's just ANNOYING. I feel like crap for SO MANY REASONS. Because I was hospitalized I automatically got a place in an ED service in my city, a place that is generally really difficult to get into. I appreciate my dietician and psychologist so, so much BUT- I'm taking a spot from someone who might actually want to recover, someone who isn't just going because that's what has to happen after a hospitalization. As horrible as it sounds (it is) I do not want to recover and I feel so guilty for even thinking this way. I'm lying even more than I did at the peak of my ED- I'm falsifying weigh ins, waiting until my parents aren't looking to dispose of food during meal times and I'm doing unholy things to purge. I'm so full of anger, towards everyone. Towards the people who care for me the most. I'm lashing out at my parents for simply caring, for wanting to just keep me alive, I'm holding a massive grudge towards my teachers for even caring despite knowing that they come from a good place. I can't keep doing this. If even with professional help, I can't seem to want to recover, why should I be taking that place from someone who actually wants to make a change? I'm beyond miserable, I've hit an all time low. I don't feel like I've got anyone to turn to, and all I've been doing is crying and wishing that everyone would just go away and let me do my own thing. I feel so incredibly selfish, I know how much this has hurt the people around me but I can't change, I've tried everything and it's done nothing but made me so, so sad.

" 

I just moved to Korea where I'm gonna be living and working for 1 year+. I'd say I'm pretty much recovered these days but at the moment I'm finding it very difficult to eat properly/enough. In quarantine I lost a small amount of weight but I really can't afford to lose weight.

At home in the UK I was vegan - not for disordered reasons! There is loads of great vegan stuff available in the UK and I enjoyed eating all kinds of vegan junk food. But here in Korea everybody loves meat and fish, kbbq, fried chicken, bulgogi, etc. Even being vegetarian is barely a thing. Realistically don't think I can be fully vegan here cause there's so few options and I'm fairly picky, but the thought of breaking my ""moral code"" (sorry not trying to sound preachy just can't think of a better way to put it) upsets me. I've been vegan for 5 years, before that vegetarian for 3 so now I feel intensely guilty if I eat something non-vegan.

Also I'm finding it tough cause I'm living on my own for the first time in a few years and now that what I eat is totally up to me I find it quite overwhelming. Sometimes I end up skipping meals or only eating a snack because I just don't know what to have, or don't want to keep eating the same stuff over and over.

Anyway I'm not actively trying to restrict or anything just worried about slipping back into disordered habits. My being here is completely tied to my job so I really don't want to get sick and be forced to go back home. Sorry this was kind of rambly. I don't really know what I want from this, I guess just to vent but if anyone can empathise or has any suggestions I'd be so grateful.

" 

This is partly a response to a conversation I had with my roommate, who is plus-sized, and who expressed her frustration with the fact that she has never been able to directly address health concerns with a doctor without the doctor interrupting her concerns to discuss her weight.

Which struck me as odd, because I have been underweight for as long as I can remember, and yet no doctor has ever expressed concerns about it. And I'm not just slightly underweight either--I've always had a wide margin between me and what's considered ""normal"", to the extent that I worry about it.

I had a therapist who expressed concerns about my thought patterns regarding my weight. I've had friends who have repeatedly tried to hold interventions about my weight. But I always have to tell them: I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight, I just can't gain it.

I'm always, always cold. I swear sweaters in August. I passed out so frequently in college that I was famous for it. But even when I've gone to a doctor's and I swooned in the doctor's office and I hit the floor, in front of the nurse, the doctor still did not consider my underweight-ness a problem.

A large reason, I think, that my doctors have never brought up my weight is that I live with IBS, so I'm constantly sick and I don't have much of an appetite, digesting food can be painful, and my body doesn't absorb nutrients very well in the first place. So, whenever my weight comes up, doctors either praise me (which is probably not okay), give me the standard ""wish I had that problem"", or say that it's no problem because I'll gain weight ""eventually"". Some people just go, ""oh, get pregnant, that'll fix it"".

I feel like being underweight is one of those things that could be a risk factor for pregnancy complications so I think perhaps doctors should not recommend I do that.

My mother says I can't help it because I'm exactly like her. I inherited her intestinal distress, but my mom never eats. Never. I remember very few times in my childhood that my mother ate more than once a day. She would only ever prepare food if my father was home. And then she wouldn't eat it.

I work really hard to make myself eat. I buy foods that are easy to prepare, that are supposed to be healthy and make my intestines work. But it's still difficult to make myself interested in eating. I might go all day without bothering.

Sometimes, I'm told that my lack of interest in eating is just my depression and that the stomach upset is just my anxiety (it's definitely related). Also, whenever I express a concern about my weight, I am immediately asked about my sexual orientation. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, because I do understand that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately affected by EDs, but my warning flags always go up when doctors seem a little too interested in my sexual orientation.

I've been told that being underweight is very unhealthy but I can't find much information about it. The second I search for it online, all I get are diet tips. Not helpful! The opposite of helpful! I also can't find anything about being underweight that isn't tied to eating disorders. Do they always go together?

Is it really that bad to be underweight if my weight is more or less stable? It won't change, no matter what I do.

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

I've been struggling with eating disorders since I was 12, but it really hit me hard when I reached 18 years old.

I have been travelling, there have been major events in my life but still... nothing. I am genuinely scared of both, my impossibility to have someone take pictures of me, because it is triggering to my body dysmorphia, and the prospect of realizing in, maybe a few years in the future, that there's no memory of my 20s to look at.

My fiancé has been in recovery for a few months now, and while it had been going really well, the past few weeks have been dreadful during meals. A couple of weeks ago, we went to the doctor together, and she came out in tears because her weight was higher than she’s ever seen it. She said it was my fault because of all the meals I make us, and she accused me of trying to make her fat. Ever since, she has been declining all meals, and reacting incredibly negatively to my prodding.

I’ve had an eating disorder myself, so I’ve always tried to be gentle but insistent with her when she doesn’t want to eat, but that’s becoming much harder to do. Tonight, when I gave her a bowl of Mac and cheese for dinner, her response was to bury her face in the hot bowl and sob out something about me wanting her to be a pig. It was terrifying to see her like that, Beyond tonight, I’ve made many meals where she angrily throws it in the trash only few minutes removed from her begging me to make it for her. She also cries during almost every meal and sometimes even collapses to the floor in hysterics. It’s really hard on me because at her core, I know she wants to get better. When she throws away food, she trues to dig it out and eat it, and her outbursts are always followed by some form of “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I don’t get better for us.” My heart is breaking.

She wants to meal prep the same thing in advance because it stops her eating too much. She’s also skipping loads of meals, this morning she bragged to me about not eating dinner and skipping breakfast when we were having lunch together. She also is always complaining about how her clothes don’t fit her anymore because she is losing weight. Not only am I worried about her but I am also worried about myself. Being around her is very triggering to me. I don’t really know what to do. She’s a wonderful person and aside from this I really like her and get on with her. I don’t know what to do about it or how to tell her her behavior is triggering for me. it’s really difficult with all the comments about losing weight and just watching her restrict her diet.

My (f20) friend (f20) told me she's been forcing herself to vomit for quite some time now. She knows it's a terrible thing to do but she hates how her body looks that's why she does it. She told me a few hours ago and I honestly didn't know how to respond. I just asked her if she told anyone about it and if she wants to call to talk about it. She replied just now that she doesn't really wanna talk about it and that she tries to stop herself whenever the thought comes to mind. But I can't be sure of it and I don't know anything about what's happening to her besides the facts that I have stated above.

The thing is, she lives in west Europe with a 7 hour time difference from me. And I'm the only person whom she told about it. I don't want to force her to tell me everything of her experience and I know it is not good nor right to ask her everyday if she's doing fine.

With this great distance and time difference, how should I approach her and make sure that she is trying to stop forcing herself to vomit?

I've long been suffering from a restrictive ED. I've been told by multiple professionals and resources that the only way for me to recover from my ED is first and foremost to 'stop restricting'. However, no one ever explained to me what that means in practice.

Because to me, right now, 'stop restricting' means just binging. There is NO amount, type or combination of food that ever satisfies me to the fullest extent. I always want to eat more. So anything other than ""eat forever"" is actually restriction.

I'm being followed by a therapist AND a dietitian but both of them no longer really know what to do with me because I'm never getting better and if anything I'm regressing. That's because on one hand the dietitian prescribed me a meal plan which, however balanced and carefully crafted it is, still feels like restriction to me - I have to eat 'normal portions' at certain times etc. - and on the other hand the therapist's been doing mental work with me that has been incredibly helpful to let me understand so many things about me and my personality and has made me progress so much in several aspects of my life, but has changed absolutely NOTHING about my ED behaviours.

Basically I follow this supposedly balanced, abundant and adequate meal plan for a while, maybe I gain some weight, but the meals never satisfy me and it feels like I'm restricting all the time, waiting for the next meal to come, always obsessing about food etc., so at some point I ditch the meal plan because if I have to restrict then I wanna do it on my own terms. So then after a while I just get fed up and I'm so ravenous that I actually do decide to 'stop restricting', so then I end up eating all the time and binge on thousands of calories, which then I promptly purge because I cannot stand the weight gain....blah blah blah, it's a very known common cycle.

I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to restrict my whole life because I cannot fathom ever being satisfied by a 'normal meal' ever again, yet I can't just binge my face off every single day. I'm not even underweight anymore like I used to so maybe I'm just broken. But the point is, all these people that say 'stop restricting' seem to actually mean 'stop restricting *below a normal amount of food*', they don't ACTUALLY mean 'stop restricting for real' and it's so frustrating.",,Request: How can I 'stop restricting' without starting binging?,9,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pe5hd1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,1630276842,430,0,0,0,-1,1,Feeling like the prescribed meal plan is still 'restriction' to the writer,harmful,"['Feeling lost and not knowing what to do in regards to the recovery process', 'Regularly cycling between restriction and bingeing/purging behaviors', ""Feeling like other people's advice to 'stop restricting' doesn't fully address the writer's restrictive ED behaviors""]",'Stop restricting' treatment approach,harmful,"['Confusion about what ""stop restricting"" means in practice and frustration with the lack of clear guidance on how to recover', 'Meal plan prescribed by dietitian feels restrictive and inadequate, leading to bingeing and purging behaviors', 'Mental work with therapist has been helpful in understanding ED behaviors and personal characteristics but has not led to changes in ED behaviors']","Lack of clear guidance for what ""stop restricting"" means in practice",harmful,"['The individual struggles with developing a healthy relationship with food and feels like everything besides ""eat forever"" is restriction, leading to binge-purge cycles and regressed behavior', 'Following a balanced meal plan feels like restriction and leaves the individual feeling dissatisfied and constantly obsessive about food', 'The individual feels lost and unsure of how to proceed with their eating disorder recovery']",1920.0,EatingDisorders

Hello… I have been thinking about this for months now and I would really appreciate people’s opinions. I might seek professional help with it if people think it’s important. For reference, I am 19 and female.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve done some research, but of course what I have always known the most about is anorexia and bulimia, which I know I do not struggle with. I have not struggled with my body image aside from mild insecurities, and I have been wanting to gain weight for years. I have always been skinny to the point of getting comments/insults on it and people assuming that I am anorexic. In more recent years, I feel that I have the capability to gain weight but I simply find myself not eating enough. Last year, I blamed my weight loss on going to college and not liking the food provided, but this summer I have been home with good food at my disposal and I think I almost eat less. I feel like I’m not doing it on purpose, or that I have a good reason, I’m just not interested or don’t think about it. I am also noticeably getting full faster. I’m sure this is negatively affecting my health but I don’t know how to fix it. Plus, I’m about to move back on campus and I’m afraid I will continue getting progressively worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And it’s not like I don’t get hungry. Like both today and yesterday, I got hungry but I just didn’t eat. I ate one meal throughout the entire day and just ignored my hunger. Why would I do that?

" 

I (26M) have been with my GF (26F) for almost two years now. When I met her, she was at a healthy weight, thin, but healthy.

I already knew that, a few years prior to us getting together, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and low weight. She talked about it with normalcy, and it was clear she was better.

During the first few months, she ate normally, and aside from a few comments about her not being perfectly happy with her body, she was stable and mostly okay. 6 months in, she had her first real episode. She said that she was obese and that she wanted to lose X amount of weight. I discouraged it, tried to be supportive, but she was set on losing weight.

I guess at this point I have to talk about her family. Her parents are just terrible, unsupportive and judgmental. Her mother is manipulative and extremely toxic, and her father is a bigot. Their way of dealing with her being unwell is telling or forcing her to eat, calling her names, or lashing out at her.

The thing is, she cares more about what her parents have to say than anything in the world. She craves their approval (which they never give) and makes them a part of everything, knowing that they're going to make everything ten times worse.

She looked like she was getting better, but then she was diagnosed with lactose and fructose intolerance, on top of her celiac disease. This has just been devastating to her mental health and her struggle against anorexia. It started by her losing a bit of weight because her stomach hurts every time she eats, and then it spiraled out of control. To her, the weight she's lost is gone forever, not the consequence of an illness that needs to be corrected, but the start of a weight loss journey.

She's already at the point of being medically underweight, but that doesn't matter. She sets the goal of losing X amount of weight, promising that she will be happy with her body then, then she reaches that weight and moves the goalposts to an even lower weight. Recently she's said that she wants to be exactly at the weight where she's not going to be hospitalized, even though that's severely underweight by any metric.

Sometimes she weighs herself and tries to celebrate with me that she's lost weight. I don't know if that's her trying to manipulate me into enabling her or just an attention-seeking behaviour, but it always leads to her being disappointed and sad that I don't celebrate with her. I don't scold her or anything, I just mention that I wish she didn't put such an emphasis on her weight.

I also can't just try to keep her mind off her weight or weight loss in general. Anything and everything can be twisted to talk about her desire to weight less and her disgust with her body. Try to play a videogame? If the player's avatar can be customized, she will make the most underweight character possible, spending ages trying to ""get the proportions right"". Reading a book? Is any of the characters fat? What do they eat?

She also suffers from GAD and, I suspect, from depression, which she absolutely refuses to even consider. She doesn't enjoy any of her old hobbies, she can't finish books or series, she just browses TikTok endlessly. She used to love her job, now she dreads going back (she's on sick leave). I have to push her to text her best friend of ten years. This all screams ""depression"" to me, someone who has gotten better from depression myself.

She's extremely intelligent and a nurse, which allows her to hide her symptoms when she talks to her psychologist and psychiatrist. She convinces all of her healthcare providers that she's just suffering from anxiety.

I love her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's everything I could ask for in a woman, but I feel like that woman is slowly being replaced by her illness. I can count with one hand the times that we've had a genuinely good time that didn't involve sex in the last 6 months. I can't go for a walk with her, as not only she doesn't want to leave the house for anything other that driving to go grocery shopping or seeing her parents, but most she will get light-headed if she walks for five minutes.

Last year, during the pandemic, her mother was making her have an anxiety attack everyday, making her life miserable. Throwing her things away (including a gift from her late best friend, who committed suicide years ago), insulting her, shouting, and my GF even told me about an incident when her mother called her obese.

All of this led me to look for an place so we could live together and get her out of her parent's house. This has been at the expense of my own goals. I was studying to get a job that would grant me economical stability for the rest of my life, and I've put that on hold to get a job and pay rent. I've even been on sick leave myself because of migraines I think are associated with stress.

She refuses therapy or treatment on the basis that ""all therapists ask her the same things"". She found A therapist that she liked last year, and left because €70 an hour was ""too expensive"", a few months after buying a €1100 iPhone, and a few months before spending more than €1000 on an iPad, and I offered to help her pay for it despite barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and her father being loaded. Money isn't the issue, and when she feels that she works well with a therapist, she leaves. I know that's what her illness compels her to do, but I cannot help but feel like she doesn't want to get better, and will actively work against it.

Yesterday she said that she wants to have children because that would help her feel better about herself. First, even if I found that believable, which I don't, I think it's horrible to bring a baby into this world as some kind of therapy. Second, she freaks out when her period makes her look a tiny little bit bloated, and I'm genuinely terrified of how she will react to pregnancy.

I'm at my wits end. I know it is not my job to ""fix"" her, but I feel like she just wants me to enable her self-destructive habits and refuses to even make an effort to get better. I would jump in front of a train for her, but I've spent the last year trying to prevent her from jumping in front on a train herself, and I don't think I have it in me anymore. I don't know how to deal with this situation anymore.

Looking for advice on how to help my sister. A little overwhelmed with all the information.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister came to me last night and told me she'd been losing a lot of weight and she doesn't feel good, she doesn't feel healthy. She's losing natural body fat and muscle mass. She tried working out to help build body mass but the next day she was bed bound because she had burned calories and stuff during the work out that she doesn't have to burn.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she will only eat so many calories in a day but most days will not eat. That if she eats something that is more calories than she has set limit to she won't eat for days after to make up for it. But then sometimes she will binge eat and then not eat anything for days after again and she feels really guilty when she binges and that's why she won't eat for days after.

&amp;#x200B;

This has started due to stress and money constraints. She lives on her own and doesn't make a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly eats vegetables and fruits and tofu. She's not a big meat eater.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if she had done any research and she said she tried but it scared her. So I offered to look into it for her and provide her with information she is looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't know where to start. I don't even know what for of eating disorder this is classified as.

I googled, I looked through the links on this sub and I tried looking at some other posts but this is all very overwhelming and I'm just hoping someone can maybe help advise on some things that maybe I don't know or which direction to start.

I never post so sorry if I gave to much information or to little.

Despite not being medically diagnosed I know for a fact I suffer from some form of an eating disorder. I constantly do body checks, check my weight every morning and every night, and I'm scared to eat fast food for breakfast and lunch and skip breakfast while constantly feeling guilty for eating lunch when i can skip it so easily. Because of this, my mental health was been deteriorating FAST. I've become more moody and distanced with my family. I'm always fine and happy at school but the moment I go home my mood is instantly ruined. I also recently started cutting myself as well. I rarely ever did it beforehand but I'm doing it so much now. I want to get help, I really do but I'm scared. I don't want to see them get heart broken. I'm scared they're gonna send me away to a mental institution and I have to much school activities to afford that, I would miss so much.

"Hello, I am submitting this post request because I have really been struggling lately. I have a fear of food stemming from my father when I was younger. I have struggled with eating for as long as I can remember. I remember trying to hide breakfast in the couch when I was a child, or crying over a bowl of spaghettios in elementary school because I was afraid to eat it. Now, I am almost 25 and it is getting bad again. I go through periods in my life where I'm kind of okay and then I always end up spiraling back to my fear. Sometimes I'm okay to eat, but then directly after I eat I go into a full blown panic attack. Things like putting peppermint oil on my arms, or chewing peppermint gum, or drinking sparkling water after a meal have helped me stay level headed but it is not always working as it did before. Sometimes, I can't finish a meal because the panic attack starts during a meal. I need help and I dont know what to do. This is ruining my life and I feel like a prisoner in my own body.

"I'll preface this by saying I'm a transgender woman. I'm 24, 5'7 and my weight has always been considered ""normal"" for BMI male standards and whatnot. In fact, my BMI still counts as normal. Basically, I never had any problems with being under/overweight but I always counted calories and felt bad about eating, especially when I binged a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been severely restricting my meals lately. I still eat every 4 to 5 hours because of gastritis (severe heartburn if I fast too often), but I'm still hungry 24/7. I used to do intermittent fasting and I loved doing that, but had to stop. Also I have been doing cardio everyday, not as a ""cheat way"" to eat more, but because I just want to speed up the process. Very low cal and cardio have nuked my weight in the last month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is that I absolutely hate not only my body, but also any sort of fat in me, especially the belly area. To me, I just think I'm in a super strict diet and took some inspiration from pro-anorexia communities. And probably because of this, I developed some very bad habits such as weighing multiple times a day and basically I just got addicted to seeing the numbers go down every single day. I know I know, just being in a community like this is wrong, but still.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I don't want to develop an ED, but I do plan on staying like this for a while until I think I'm skinny enough. My parents won't stop saying that I look too skinny already, and sometimes I lie to them about having eaten when in reality I didn't. Some of my friends also told me they are worried because of my appearance. One of them even suggested I could have anorexia, and at that time I was eating normally. I thought she was completely overreacting, but now I'm reconsidering that because of my current habits and goals. I just cannot see anything wrong with it, because I'm still very far from my goal, and it feels like they are all picking on me because they don't want me to be skinny for whatever reason. Sometimes I also have nightmares regarding binge eating. And last but not least, maybe I'm just doing this for attention? Tho I really only told about this to a single friend who wasn't very judgmental. Like with the same argument people use for self-harmers, which... is also something I did. I also used to starve sometimes for self-harm purposes, but I can't do it right now due to the mentioned gastritis, but I would if I could, so I had to switch my method.",,"Request: Is something wrong with me?

" 

When I was 14, I started struggling a lot with my weight. It was all I could think about, and I started eating a lot less. I don't want to go into everything that happened during this time, but my behavior was definitely concerning. The only reason it didn't get worse was because of a traumatic event that occurred that made it hard to think about anything else. Obviously the thoughts and certain behaviors didn't completely go away, but it wasn't as much of a problem. I'm 17 now.

If I gain even a little bit of weight, I hate myself and immediately start eating less. I frequently think I weigh too much (I'm currently at a healthy weight), and have thoughts of restricting my eating daily. The only reason I haven't is because my energy decreases very quickly and I feel like I'm going to pass out, become extremely dizzy, and can hardly stand up if I go more than 4-5 hours without food, whether I'm hungry or not.

That's quite literally the only thing preventing me from eating less, and I hate it. I don't feel like any of my thoughts or feelings regarding my weight and food in general are serious enough because I don't have a choice but to eat every few hours, even if it's just a small snack, so I don't pass out.

It doesn't help that I can't eat a lot of things sometimes feeling nauseous. I hate this cycle of ""have to eat regularly so I don't pass out, but can hardly even eat anything without feeling nauseous, and hate myself for eating when I do.""

"Hi all, I’m a 20 year old with ADHD and ASD. Just thought I’d ask for advice because my behavior recently has become kinda concerning, but I’m not really sure who to talk to or what it is exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, over the past week or so, I’ve been dehydrating myself—which is something I’ve done before, but usually I can talk myself out of it before it gets this bad. It’s been taking over my life and making it difficult for me to do anything else, as well as affecting me physically by making me very constipated (sorry for TMI), but for whatever reason I can’t stop. I don’t know how long this is going to last, and I’m worried I might eventually stop drinking water altogether and land myself in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve mostly been eating food like normal, though. The few times I skipped meals, it was because I was worried eating would make me thirsty and I’d end up drinking water, and I hated the thought of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay with my weight and body shape, so I know this isn’t related to a body image issue. Honestly, I think it’s just a really shitty grab for control. For whatever reason, I experience a lot of anxiety around peeing (I’m sorry, I know that doesn’t make sense but I just do lmao), and dehydrating limits my bathroom trips which is nice and also kinda why I started in the first place lmao. The problem is I know this could damage my body if I continue, but I can’t stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I didn’t know where else to ask. Could this be an ED, but somehow only with water/liquids and not food??? Or is it something else—my gut says maybe OCD, but I’m not sure if it can manifest this way, does anyone have experience with that??? I’m kind of at a loss here and I’d appreciate if anyone else has any input.

Hi, I've struggled with what I believe to be an eating disorder for about a year now, although the intensity of it has fluctuated. I've recently started eating normally again, eating a regular amount of calories opposed to the amount I was eating, so about xxx more (I think I should add that I've always just fasted and worked out, never purged). But with this I've noticed I've started getting way hungrier, like usually I can last about 24 hours without eating and feel alright but since I've been eating better I can only last about 8. I guess this is just my body getting back into how it used to be but it's all happened so suddenly, and its weird because I didn't even do this with the intent to ""recover"", I've just been eating more.

Hi, my girlfriend is struggling with an ED and I really don’t know how to help her properly. I’ve done my research to better understand how an eating disorder works, what it does, what it feels like, and what it is. I know so much more than I did initially, but because of the distance between me and her I still don’t know what to do or say properly.

I understand I don’t have the power to fix this problem, I understand I can’t control how she eats or perceives herself, and I am not in control of her relapses. I encourage her to talk about how she feels and I try to be there to listen more than anything else. If she doesn’t want to talk about it or feels uncomfortable I let her know it’s okay and I change the subject. I let her know she is important and she matters, as well as her health.

I suggested to her a doctor or therapist but she doesn’t think her condition needs help. She doesn’t want to seek help or get better, and I understand I am not in control of that.

"I’ve been in anorexia recovery for almost a year now, and I still have a lot of trouble accepting my weight gain.

Hi!

I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I've been on and off restricting for years now. I had good months, bad ones but I've never needed help. Recently I had a really bad few months, it took very long and I was getting worried. Restricting never lasted so long before. I went to my doctor and he advised to visit a dietician but I'm still young and studying and do not have money for that. Instead I decided to let go of all my food rules. I started slow, including fear foods in my daily diet, but now I started binging. I did some research and I think it might be extreme hunger. I do not know it is possible for me to experience it. I can just eat and eat and eat until I'm so stuffed I've never been before and all I can do is think about my next meal. It takes an hour or so and I'm hungry again. I've tried to not give in, but I read that you should give in to this extreme hunger so I did for a week or so. Today alone I ate as much as I would in 2,5 days. I've gained some weight already (note: I've never been underweight and have always had a healthy weight) I feel fat, sick and I end up crying in my bed everyday because of how much I ate. I can't believe I'm still hungry after all I've eaten.

Is this extreme hunger or binging? And does anyone have any tips for recovering without any help?

"in the past year i (19f) gained weight and it’s easily noticeable, i don’t even fit into the clothes i bought in december (which were already bigger than what i used to wear). i’m stuck in the mindset that i should purposefully not eat for an extended period of time to punish myself for eating out or having certain high calorie foods. for example, if i go out with friends and we all go to a restaurant, i’d be very self conscious about what i eat there but still feel very ashamed when i come home, that i feel like i need to not eat for the next day. naturally i’d get hungry, but i’d think that giving in to the hunger is a sign of weakness and i should hold out on not eating. i beat myself up for getting hungry, and when i finally do eat something it’s like i completely failed my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

when it comes to the choice of food, i think i have an addiction to spending money on takeout or delivery rather than making something healthier at home. i can’t control the urges to pick up my phone and order something (often in bigger amounts than i need), and feel disgusted and angry at myself for doing that after i’ve eaten. the cycle repeats itself from there, so i’d go through eating a lot —&gt; not eating to punish myself.

"I have unhealthy body image issues, but only when I'm underweight. I would love to know if anyone can relate. I used to have some disordered eating patterns in my late teens (I'm currently 24). I've always been on the lower end of the healthy BMI range. I do fluctuate a bit, like most people do, but I'm usually comfortable in my body no matter what shape it's in. I don't really feel the need or desire to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I do happen to lose weight, as I recently unintentionally did, it sometimes triggers something in me. Whenever I reach or cross the threshold of being underweight, I become hyper-aware of my body. I look at the signs of being a tad too skinny (very visible collarbones, sternum slightly poking through, etc.). I don't think it's particularly attractive, but I'm not repulsed by it either; instead it's almost like I'm fascinated by it. Body-image wise, I know that if I were to gain the weight back and be within my typical range, I would feel perfectly fine, and I wouldn't think about it anymore - I'd be back to normal. I'd be happy to get some volume back in my chest, in fact. It's not even that big of difference in my weight or how my body looks, but just knowing I'm under the normal range is what triggers me. A part of me wants to stay this way. I think I like the idea of being ""tiny"", and maybe even of people expressing concern for me. I hate that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

And I hate that I wasn't even actively trying to lose it, but now that I have, I need to be careful. The few times I noticed this in the past, I got out of it pretty easily. I have no issues with food anymore, and eat rather intuitively. But over the last few months, due to depression and medication, my appetite and interest in food are lower, so it's easier to think that my weight loss is ""inevitable"", and harder to get back to normal. I'm not restricting myself, but I'm also not putting in the effort to eat more.

I'm not sure if eating disorders are made to make you gain weight or not. I am rapidly gaining weight at the moment I think I may have a food addiction.

I wish I could hate eating and despise it since I'm becoming overweight and it will be hard for me to deal with this.

Hey all. Recently I walked in on my wife self purging. Since we have had some talk related to the ED, her, and my role in her recovery. Today, maybe 7 months after, somethings still seem odd/ off but I can't keep asking her all the time.

 1) she reports it's been some time since the last purge. But she does to the bath room during meals. Now, to me, it sounds like there is a very quick like burst of water that enters the toilet then 5 seconds later the sound of a woman peeing. I thought a pre pee poop, but it's all the time. Do people with ED purge that fast?

 2) pre bed habits- again the bathroom thing, then after a flush she stands by the toilet a little long (again like 10 seconds). Brushes teeth, then flossing like crazy. She will take a shot of backing soda. Drink some water, then make a baking soda water. She reports acid reflex. 

3) does this seem like behaviors of it being a daily thing? Is it that fast or if she's in the bathroom for 45 seconds I shouldn't worry? Are these eating disorder coaches a real thing? She listens to odd pod cast sometimes and they talk about body issues (maybe positive things but I have only heard negative). Then how can I help or ask? We've been trying for a year and half for a kid and we both are ""normal"" but I don't think she told Docs about a ED. Would it be an issue if it was every now and then or is it an issue because it's more often then she tells me?

Appreciate your thoughts sorry it's a lot. I'm just looking to see if I'm super crazy or not. I am trying to change my own thoughts on this so I may better trust her to tell me the whole truth.

"I noticed this earlier this year. I had been not eating breakfast (because I don't like most breakfast foods), not bringing a lunch to school (I didn't like cold food, and also covid was a thing), and waiting until 3:00 to eat.

"Hi guys ! I (31F) have had problems with food since I was a teenager principally due to my grandmother, who I was living with at the time, always putting me on diet and commenting my physic (which btw was absolutely fine at the time). Since then I developed ED and did a lot of yoyos : I am either on diet and losing weight or doing hyperphagia and binge eating. I am always obsessed with food and thinking about it. I am always craving almost everything but mainly sweets. I just gave birth 5 months ago and I really took a lot of weight and I am now obese. I am extremely sad to be fat again and feel awful all the time, envying other girls in the street or on internet. I also had a fight recently with my partner who basically doesn’t understand why I am always struggling and I can’t simply « lose weight since I don’t want to stay fat anymore ».

Now I would like to find a balanced way of eating and I am very motivated to start 18:6 intermittent fasting. I’ve tried it these two past days and feeling good since it restricts the windows where I can eat and thanks to this I can think of something else but food during the fasting time. I try to stick to healthy food during the hours where I can eat. Only I am worried if it is safe for me to continue on this way or will it likely trigger my ED.

My Dad is a no-nonsense, no-emotion, would never ask for help, would never go for counselling kind of guy. However he has lost a significant amount of weight over the summer due to his small meals, and his 3-6 hours of exercise a day. My whole family is aware of his current habits.

He normally has oatmeal for breakfast, an apple or carrots for lunch, and a really small dinner (like a salad). First of all he is not even eating enough for someone his size even if the person was inactive. Second, because he works out so much he should be eating way more. He is also constantly weighing himself and bringing up his weight in conversation, saying that he thought he should have lost more weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help him, but this is different because it’s my dad, and because he has a tricky ego complex. How do I encourage healthy habits and how do in recommend that he seeks medical advice?

It got better over the years, then worse, then better again. I’ve never truly “recovered”, just very high highs and very low lows. I spent my sophomore year starving myself, then my junior year is when I started purging.

&amp;#x200B;

It got so bad that I was vomiting blood and knew i needed to get help, but I couldn’t bring myself to confess why. My mother just thought I was very sick. Went to a gastroenterologist, got put on a few medications, I even ended up getting a damn endoscopy / colonoscopy. The whole time I knew that this was all for nothing and the guilt only fueled my disorder. At some point, the purging turned into another form of self harm.

I got better after that, and I’d been better for the past two years, but it’s back. It’s back and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t eat anything without purging. Even if I plan on keeping food down, I panic and purge. The past two days I just haven’t eaten because I don’t want to purge.

**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**

&amp;#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&amp;#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals. She has always been hated the attention and will likely resent us for her stay there anyway. Should we just wait and see what happens?

"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been living with restrictive eating for 30+ years, I have severe PTSD and moderate to severe depression plus now, a little postpartum (hormones and all) added in. I gained… well we don’t do numbers here so I’ll tell you I doubled in size during pregnancy because the second I found out I stopped restricting bc I was worried about the baby and woooow it went on fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I had my little princess 7 months ago- there were problems. She is ok and healthy and bouncy, I am still doing physical therapy and occupational therapy and speech. Getting better but not where I need to be yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost most of the baby weight within 4 months. Hubby pointed out he doesn’t want me to ever be sooooo small again as I got after our first child (I almost died from it). I spoke to my trauma therapist and most of my motivation actually came from wanting to set a better example for my daughter on what a good relationship with food and your own body can be. With his help, I started treatment for ED (now with new onset of binging and purging associated with a self destructive mindset that awakens during flashbacks or whenever I’m physically unable to do things).

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been slowly increasing intake with my team and doing all the feelings stuff etc. within 4 weeks of starting, I gained it ALL back and then some. I’m now well above a healthy BMI. I asked about it and whether I could start trying to slow the gain soon- I was told to love myself even if I get huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what to do. My goals of losing the baby weight are being ignored, I don’t want to do it in a disordered way but I want to feel normal again. Do I switch out the team members who are not supporting my goals (goal is to lose excess weight and still remain 1/2 way between the low and high end of my healthy range).

"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

So, first of all, I am 16 and male (trans). My weight is normal.

Ever since I was little, I would feel really uncomfortable with the thought of being overweight or overeating, to the point where I would cry because the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone. They'd come when I was around food, so in ""normal"" circumstances, or at completely random times. Sometimes I'd imagine people I know overeating/being overfed, and gaining a lot of weight - not on purpose, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I have this same problem. I'm still getting sick from these thoughts and I generally avoid eating too much for that same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started puberty, I also started gaining weight, which is normal, but I hated it. I loathed having fat rolls here and there, or a small double chin, or a stomach that wasn't unrealistically flat. Fot that reason, I started restricting my eating habits around two years ago. Skipping full meals doesn't work when I'm at home, so I just do that when I'm not - which is about once a week. I then skip lunch entirely and only eat a small dinner. Other than that, I try not to eat unhealthy snacks. I often realise how much I've eaten on a day and I then get angry at myself and start crying again. Reading about calories just makes me feel bad over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love cooking and baking, and during lockdown I used to bake a lot, but I rarely ever ate what I made, out of fear. Outside of that, I mostly stayed at home during that time, so I was even more concerned with my own weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried to work out. I'm sadly not a very disciplined person, so I rarely ever actually work out, but I really hate myself for this every night. My weight and the way my body looks just makes me cry and I am trying my best to change this.

Several years ago my stepdaughter was admitted to the hospital almost in a coma because her mom had starved her over time. From what I gather, the mother was convinced they should only eat organic/non-gmo (which isn’t a bad thing ofc), but there are a lot of holes in the story. For one, the mom was underweight but relatively healthy. My stepdaughter weighed half what would have been appropriate.

Now she’s better, in terms of getting enough calories. Shes still in a skilled nursing facility because, while she’s out of the woods, her mom has bred distrust and apathy. The thinking is sort of ‘why bother doing for myself because I just always hurt and everyone is mad at me and I’ll just try to be very small so as not to bother…’ It’s problematic, but my goals are to bolster self esteem and confidence.

Anyway she’s at goal weight but someone suggested her skewed view of food and eating might mean she has an eating disorder(?)

This is new for me but I think counseling would help. I’m encouraging her to talk to someone (she has access but no desire). Beyond that, though, I’d like to find out what small things I can do to assist.

Is this an ED? Could her constant pain be a lasting effect? What other lasting effects could this have caused?

Does anyone know of any books or theories that may be helpful? Or if anyone has gone through this sort of Munchausen(by proxy)-esque forced/complicit starvation..?

I’m not really sure where to start, besides just being super patient and encouraging. I feel like I could do more to support her recovery.

" 

When  I was 16 I obsessed with my weight and weighed myself multiple times a  day. If the number changed even a little I was immediately restricting  my already extremely restricted diet. My parents would always serve me  up a smaller portion of food compared to my brothers. I barely ate and  if I gained any weight my Mum would comment on me getting chubby, and  grab any belly fat that I had. For reference I was about 5'8 at the time  and weighed xx kgs (normal range). I thought I was fat. When my parents weren't looking  I would sneak into the pantry and binge on any and all 'bad' food I  could. I would eat the baking chocolate, biscuits, museli bars,  everything. My parents kept bells on their snack cupboard so we couldn't  help ourselves, it'd been this way since we were little and continued  until we moved out.  I eventually got a job in a supermarket and had  ready access to foods I wasn't 'allowed because they'd make me fat' so I  started bingeing at work, buying copious amounts of food at work and  stuffing my face on my breaks. I'd come home and hide food in my room.  This lead to massive weight gain and more and more comments my weight  and appearance. I thought I looked disgusting but couldn't stop.  Eventually things balanced out and I lost a lot of the extra weight  through reducing sugar and healthy eating along with exercise. But I  still saw myself as fat. Still couldn't see that I'd changed my body. 

Since then, I have a horrible relationship with my body and with  food. I struggle with body dysmorphia on the daily. Some days seeing  myself as so huge and disgusting I want to never look at myself again,  and others viewing myself as 'normal' but then not fitting into my  clothes size as they're suddenly too small. And so the cycle goes, round  and around. 

I hide food constantly, sneak snacks, binge on foods like I'll never  have it again, then buy more. I feel so ashamed tucking away bags of  m&amp;Ms or bars of chocolate but can't help it, I crave the sugar and  snacks and can't stop myself. 

I have had a baby, 11mo, and my body has changed again. Breastfeeding  has me starving 80% of the time and often I get so hungry there doesn't  feel like any time at all to make food so I reach for what is ready  available- which often means things that are higher in calories and  sugar. I am huge, the biggest I've ever been on the scale. I'm obsessed,  and most of the time hate the way I look. Each time I see a photo of  myself or see my reflection, all I see is the fat, the chin, my  stomach... I adore my stretch marks because they're a sign of my baby,  permanently carved into my body, but the weight that goes along with  it... I hide my body under baggy clothes... I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the energy to work out, I'm dealing with a broken bone  that is still causing pain 5 months later... Pain all over my body...

My b/p has gotten absolutely out of control lately  and I'm scared to DEATH. I've been struggling with occasional purging  for a few years now but my main problem used to be restriction and until  the last couple months I had never purged this much this frequently.  I'm already feeling the physical effects, my mouth is sore, my teeth  feel sensitive and my stomach burns.

I really really need to stop asap. But I know that if I stop purging I  will just keep binging and the mere thought of weight gain completely  terrifies me. I've tried keeping a binge down but the feeling of dread  and sheer panic over weight gain was completely unbearable so I only  lasted less than an hour before rushing to the toilet.

The fact is, I'm no longer underweight so I feel like I have no  ""room"" to binge anymore, which only worsens the anxiety around binges.

I've tried everything. I have a therapist who no longer knows what to  do with me because I never improve. I have a meal plan and it's not  helping. I try following it and eating ""balanced meals"" and they never  satisfy me so in the end I binge anyway. I don't understand the concept  of ""stop restricting"" because for me it just means binging (and  generally eating ALL THE FOOD). I'm not underweight and I'm only a few  lbs below my pre-ED weight so that cannot make much of a difference.  With my therapist I've even tried to journal to detect if my binges are  associated to any emotional patterns but we couldn't find any. I binge  when I'm happy and when I'm sad, I binge when I have a lot of feelings  to process and when everything's quiet, I binge when I'm busy and when  I'm not busy, I binge when I have lunch and when I don't.

I have dealt with an eating disorder as a form of self harm  (restricting and purging) for about two years. It was mostly unrelated  to weight as I was already underweight when it started. As time went on I  punished myself for being so underweight that I would continue to  starve myself. I've been recoved for about two years and have no real  triggers and I don't see myself at risk of relapse. That's not what this  is about, just background.

My boyfriend of a year now confessed to me in June that he believes  he has an eating disorder. His family has mocked his weight since he was  8 years old, forced him to go onto diets, etc. He still lives at home  and is constantly mocked for his weight and compared to his siblings.  But what baffles me is that he is not overweight. He would still be  perfect in my eyes if he was, I just don't understand where the comments  are coming from. I suppose he could be described as chubby but I  absolutely couldn't see him as overweight to any extreme amount. He has a  very distorted self image due to a lifetime of being mocked and shamed  by his family.

In June he told me that a few months before he'd started using a  calorie tracking app and it had spiraled out of control. He often eats  twice a day, at dinner and whatever he can find after midnight. It's  very obviously not enough as he's constantly feeling sick, bruising  easily, having memory issues and is exhausted most of the day. He's also  very depressed a lot of the time, sleeping about 14 hours a day,  isolating himself at times, etc. It hurts to watch him struggle and know  that there isn't anything I can really do. If he was anyone else I  would tell someone close to him that could help him, but I worry the  people he stays with would even encourage it.

He's self aware, knows it's harmful and says he just doesn't know how  to break the pattern. I offer advice (from my own experience and things  I read online) and support, compliment him on things unrelated to his  appearance unless comments on his body are welcomed. I'm doing  everything I can find to do and I know that he's been getting better  instead of worse, but it hurts so bad to watch him struggle in a similar  way I did.

He does see a therapist but he hasn't brought anything related to  this up. I of course haven't given him any ultimatums or forced him to  do anything, but I've been e",,Request: Is there anything more I can do to help my partner with his eating disorder?,8,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,p1cwwx,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/p1cwwx/request_is_there_anything_more_i_can_do_to_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/p1cwwx/request_is_there_anything_more_i_can_do_to_help/,1628550791,443,0,0,0,-1,1,"Boyfriend being mocked for his weight by family, using a calorie tracking app that spiraled out of control, eating patterns that are not enough, symptoms of depression",harmful,"['Distorted self-image due to lifelong shaming and mocking by family', 'Feeling sick, bruising easily, having memory issues, and feeling constantly exhausted', 'Receiving emotional support and advice from partner, being self-aware of the eating disorder', 'Seeing a therapist but not discussing eating disorder']","Boyfriend being mocked and shamed by family for his weight, using a calorie tracking app which led to disordered eating habits",harmful,"['Eating only twice a day and not consuming enough food, leading to physical symptoms and exhaustion', 'Feeling depressed and isolating himself at times', 'Struggling with breaking the pattern of disordered eating', 'Not bringing the issue up with his therapist']","Boyfriend being mocked by his family for his weight, using calorie tracking app, eating twice a day, feeling sick, exhausted, and depressed",harmful,"['Distorted self-image due to consistent mocking and shaming', 'Aware that his behavior is harmful but unsure of how to break the pattern', 'Seeing a therapist but not yet discussing the eating disorder']",1997.0,EatingDisorders

Hi, I'm depressed and have been Having trouble with food which have caused me to lose quite a bit of weight.

I am never alone, and have come to the realisation that anyone even  being in the house deters me from eating. I have not eaten for more than  a week. I don't feel like I can ask my roommate to leave the house for  several hours, just so I might eat. I am a very slow eater, most likely  due to IBS, and a simple meal might take me an hour to consume. 

I have previously been a foodie, and always loved baking and cooking  so this is quite upsetting. I can't even get myself to use utensils, or  have anything that might smell and bother others. 

Anyone have any suggestions on how to be okay with others being near when you eat/ know that you are eating?

I struggled with binge eating disorder and bulimia  for years and it’s starting to reach a head. I’ve told myself I would  never resort back to bulimia after I nearly choked on my own vomit, but  I’ve been binging a lot lately and it’s made me feel very worthless.  Since I was young I dealt with a lot of abuse and stress and food was my  only way to cope. I eventually found more productive activities like  drawing, writing, and skateboarding, but lately I’ve resorted back to  binge eating. It’s taking a huge hit to my self esteem and it feels like  an inescapable hole. I eat because I’m depressed, then I’m depressed  because I eat. I’ve never really told anyone about my disorder, because  I’m a guy and people don’t take it seriously or think it’s a “feminine”  thing.

What can I do to help her? I'm unsure of when exactly  it started but she told me within the first 6 months of dating. She  told me her brother and others would make fun of her for being  overweight by her brother and some people at school when she was in  middle school and high school, so I can assume it started around 10  years ago since she is 25. She is like 5' 7 and maybe weighs xxx pounds (very thin)  now. Her parents know but I'm not sure to the extent, since they never  mention it. They are probably just pretending it's not a problem because  they feel bad/helpless. Heck, I'm not even sure how often she does it  because we don't live together, but I do know she has acid reflux and  sensitive teeth because of it. I try sometimes to talk about it but she  just says that she has good days and bad days sometimes. I've told her  to talk to a professional because I feel helpless, but she gets  defensive.

As  the title says, I think I have an eating disorder. Everything started  about 1 year ago: I got kinda addicted to workout videos and trying to  reach the perfect body shape.  I endend up losing way too much kilos in  just two months- but I felt beautiful and perfect and healthy and  accepted.

During that period, I  stared eating less and less while occasionally having binge eating  episodes during which I ate way too much for my body.

I was scared of eating - I still kinda am.

I count calories and I'm at that point in which I know how many calories there are in a dish by heart.

But  is it really an ED? During the last month I gained that weight right  back and I ate a lot, without restricting and counting and weighting  myself.

I feel like shit and I  tell myself I'll get right back on track with cutting off calories and  workouts but that only leads me to eat more and binge.

I hate my body and how chubby it has become. I don't feel attractive anymore. I just want to be as skinny as I was before.

Hi!

So, after trying to recover for the first time and relapsing which  lasted about a month, I've decided to try recovery again. I've been  recovering for a few days now and eating at maintenance, so I know I  won't gain or lose weight (I'm at a healthy weight. I don't see a reason  for me to gain and I'm happy eating at maintenance). Yet, whenever I  get on the scale in the morning and expect weight loss, I'm disappointed  each time I maintain.  It's stupid because I'm not in a deficit  anymore, I don't know how to get the idea of ""you need to lose more  weight"" out of my head because I know I don't need to. I don't know how  to accept the fact that I'm fine where I am.",,Request: How to get out of the mindset that I need to lose weight?,6,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,p1crqz,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/p1crqz/request_how_to_get_out_of_the_mindset_that_i_need/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/p1crqz/request_how_to_get_out_of_the_mindset_that_i_need/,1628550311,133,0,0,0,-1,1,Struggling with distorted thoughts related to weight loss and body image,harmful,"['Trying to recover for the second time after a previous relapse', 'Eating at maintenance and maintaining a healthy weight', 'Feeling disappointed when not losing weight despite knowing that they do not need to lose weight']",Expectations of weight loss despite being in recovery,harmful,"['Struggling to accept that maintaining weight is healthy', ""Feeling disappointed when not losing weight despite knowing that they don't need to""]",Struggling with the belief that they need to lose weight despite being at a healthy weight and eating at maintenance,harmful,['Experiencing disappointment and difficulty accepting that they are at a healthy weight and do not need to lose any more weight'],2004.0,EatingDisorders
"Lately I've been in a depressive episode and I've had a lot of trouble eating consistently, partly because I'm sleeping most hours of the day and sort of wasting away.

Normally in the past I'd rely on liquids, meal replacement drinks and a lot of whole milk and whatnot. There are a few things that I'd be willing to eat but eating a ton of it on an empty stomach is a horrible idea (namely Takis, I've hurt my stomach doing that before.)
