I'll start. 

You swing by Mcdonalds to get a snack thinking a few nuggets would be cool intending on only getting a 4 piece but instead end up ordering 60 nuggets and two large fries intending on sharing with the family. Before you know it you end up eating one of the fry packs and 50 of the nuggets on the car ride home. Ditch the evidence in a gas station trash can hoping no one saw you. 

You feel guilty at the grocery store like people are judging the contents of your cart. 

You have ever ate a whole pint of ice cream and whole package of mega stuffed oreos in one sitting even though you are lactose intolerant which fucked your gut up for at least a week afterwards. 

You have ever binged in your car because you didn't want anyone to see just how much you actually ate. 

You attempted to control a binge by binging on something healthy and high fiber (I made some low-carb/high fiber muffins) to curb your appetite figuring you won't eat too many of them before the fiber makes you too full. After eating all 24 muffins in one sitting you experience the weirdest form of solid diarrhea ever (sorry if tmi).  

Alternately you attempted to binge on apples and ended up eating at least a dozen of them before severe stomach cramps stopped you. Or a 2 pound bag of carrots. 

You have ever ate a whole cake in one sitting then tried to convince yourself at least it isn't taking up space in the fridge.

thanks for making this space.

i was diagnosed w/ AN (b/p subtype) in 1997 as a teenager, solid in recovery since my mid 20's.  It's definitely been a battle. I've been in some form of therapy and/or medication every since my initial diagnosis.

i'm now 40 and having some relapses w/ purging lately, had a purging episode one night this last week.

I'd like to say that it's good to see Purging Disorder being recognised more often now.

It always was a huge part of my ED, both exercising and self induced vomiting.

There needs to be much more medical research done (and funding) about how to treat it.

Anyone please feel free to message me any time. No one should be ashamed to seek support.

I started going to a nutritionist last November and when I started going I was eating max 2 meals a day and purging routinely. But throughout this process it been so frustrating to find articles and stuff about people who restrict eating and purge. I feel like I am all alone. I hear about people who restrict and people who binge eat because that's what gets all the attention when talk about eating disorders. Given I can't even say disorder out loud, but it'd make me feel less alone if I could put myself into some category that wasn't as vague as 'disordered eating' or 'purging disorder' because I feel like the description of purging disorder j talks about purging and not restricting. Also when you read stuff about eating disorders online and talk to people about it nobody ever talks about how FLUID it is. Like I used to purge a lot a lot and then I tried to help myself by stopping and I just started restricting what I eat even more. IT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE!! Also recently I realized that my favorite part of drinking is coming home and throwing up because the best part about it is that I'm not 'purging' NO I'M PULLING TRIG its fun like what ever. But im beginning to realize that its really reflecting purging behavior because I won't have even drunk that much and I won't feel sick but I'll make myself do it anyways bc its kinda socially more acceptable than purging and I can convince myself that its not. And the worse part about it is that I've been telling my nutritionist that I haven't been purging bc I didn't count it right and I was really starting to feel like I was making a comeback but no I've been making myself throw up at least twice a month most months. I go to look online about correlations between drinking and purging disorder and I can't find any and it makes me feel so alone. Who am I supposed to talk to? I don't feel like I can talk to them bc I don't want to trigger them bc u never know what someones dealing with and the only people I know who like talk about their eating disorders are bulimic or anorexic and I know that this is all so personal and I don't want to trigger anyone.

She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled.

,27,EatingDisorders,"Today my sister and I got into an argument of sorts. She said she was having a bad day. When I asked her why, she told me to just be grateful I “don’t have any problems”. 

I knew she was referring to her eating problems. She told me before how she gets annoyed when her friends complain about their problems because at least they “don’t go hungry every day”. She says that everyone else’s issues are “external” and fixable (e.g. having an exam to sit: the problem is over once the exam finishes) whereas her ED is “internal” - it’s part of her that she can never change, that affects her constantly.

I was initially annoyed that she assumed I didn’t have problems. I do. I just choose not to share them with anyone. I struggle with gender dysphoria, which I would consider to be “internal”, like hers. But I didn’t feel like coming out to her just to prove a point.

Anyways, I ask her the question “So, if you were born on a desert island with no people to interact with, no society, but all the resources you would need to survive, would you have these eating problems?”

I wanted to prove a point to her. The point being: your problems aren’t actually internal - they are a consequence of society. I posed this question partly to prove my sister wrong and partly because I care about her and want her to think critically about why she has her ED.

She mumbled a response, her eyes not meeting mine. “Sorry?” I said. I looked over at her and realised that her voice was choked with tears as she said “No”.

We were on a walk to the shops together and she cried quietly the way there. I felt like I had struck something important inside of her, some sort of realisation. But I also felt terribly guilty for upsetting her. I apologised when we reached the shops and she said “It’s not your fault.”

I want to encourage my sister to talk to me about how she feels about food, and she likes to occasionally. I’ve always felt like talking it through rationally might help. Today was a mess though. I was on edge the rest of the day, not wanting to make her cry again.

I want to help her. It feels like the only way I can is to reach her through words. But I don’t have an ED myself, and I fear I’m doing it all wrong. I don’t like to upset her and I want her to trust me. What’s the best thing I can do for her?

,30,EatingDisorders,So I've gotten into a huge restrict - binge cycle and I've been purging recently. Today I ended up eating cake since I assisted to 2 birthdays. I feel extremely guilty about it and I try to stick to the thought that everything will be fine and that my body will stay the same since it doesn't really matter that much but I just can't help it but feel guilty and my ED voice keeps telling me bad things. I don't really know how to distract myself from the bad thoughts and I have nothing to do right now. What can I do??,,How do I distract myself from the guilt?,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10oilxl,1,KatSlash_,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10oilxl/how_do_i_distract_myself_from_the_guilt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10oilxl/how_do_i_distract_myself_from_the_guilt/,1675026349,103,0,0,0,-1,1,"Restrictive diet, binge eating, and purging",harmful,"['Experiencing guilt and negative thoughts after eating cake', 'Difficulty distracting oneself from bad thoughts', 'Lack of activities to engage in']","Restricting, bingeing, and purging",harmful,['Experiencing guilt and negative self-talk related to eating cake at a birthday party'],"Restrictive eating pattern, binge eating, and purging",harmful,"['Feeling extremely guilty about eating cake at a party', 'Struggling to distract oneself from negative thoughts related to the eating disorder']"
