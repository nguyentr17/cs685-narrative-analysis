1,EatingDisorders,"I 26 f told the truth for the first time about my eating disorder to my boyfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years now. I've been bulimic since I was a child. The first time i purge was around when i was 12. I've been dealing with this alone my whole life. You know how it is, my ed consume my life in so many ways. Lately it's been particularly difficult, I don't have a nice life for many reasons that I'm not gonna explain here, because even though this is anonymous I'm not ready to talk about it. 
I find extremely difficult to talk about my problems, I usually bottles up everything. 
I didn't eat for the last 3 days. I've quit smoking 2.5 years ago and today smoked 6 cigarettes. Half an hour ago I was with my boyfriend and, I don't know fucking why I told him everything. I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me.

5,EatingDisorders,"So i (f21) had an ed for 3 years (anorexia and bulimia) and been recovering for 4. In my class, there is this girl who is clearly very anorexic. I can see all of her behaviours (not ever sitting down, perfectionism, never eating lunch or anything, exercising VERY excessively for multiple hours every single day, being very underweight, bragging about only eating vegetables, being clearly very insecure but needing a lot of attention, hair loss, brittle finger nails.... the list goes on). She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled. At that moment i felt a panic attack setting in. I recovered all on my own and told almost no one, and every time i talk about it, i get anxiety and panic attacks. Could this be because i am triggered, or because it holds a lot of trauma that needs to be processed? If so, how? Does crying about it make it better or does it Trigger my ed thoughts and depression?

13,EatingDisorders,"Today my sister and I got into an argument of sorts. She said she was having a bad day. When I asked her why, she told me to just be grateful I “don’t have any problems”. 

I knew she was referring to her eating problems. She told me before how she gets annoyed when her friends complain about their problems because at least they “don’t go hungry every day”. She says that everyone else’s issues are “external” and fixable (e.g. having an exam to sit: the problem is over once the exam finishes) whereas her ED is “internal” - it’s part of her that she can never change, that affects her constantly.

I was initially annoyed that she assumed I didn’t have problems. I do. I just choose not to share them with anyone. I struggle with gender dysphoria, which I would consider to be “internal”, like hers. But I didn’t feel like coming out to her just to prove a point.

Anyways, I ask her the question “So, if you were born on a desert island with no people to interact with, no society, but all the resources you would need to survive, would you have these eating problems?”

I wanted to prove a point to her. The point being: your problems aren’t actually internal - they are a consequence of society. I posed this question partly to prove my sister wrong and partly because I care about her and want her to think critically about why she has her ED.

She mumbled a response, her eyes not meeting mine. “Sorry?” I said. I looked over at her and realised that her voice was choked with tears as she said “No”.

We were on a walk to the shops together and she cried quietly the way there. I felt like I had struck something important inside of her, some sort of realisation. But I also felt terribly guilty for upsetting her. I apologised when we reached the shops and she said “It’s not your fault.”

I want to encourage my sister to talk to me about how she feels about food, and she likes to occasionally. I’ve always felt like talking it through rationally might help. Today was a mess though. I was on edge the rest of the day, not wanting to make her cry again.

I want to help her. It feels like the only way I can is to reach her through words. But I don’t have an ED myself, and I fear I’m doing it all wrong.

Hi, I’m in my early 30s and I struggle with anorexia. I am underweight (borderline) and I am worried about fainting or having an episode that I end up in the hospital for. My husband has been begging me to get labs done but I am not ready for recovery again. Last time I felt like a cow being funneled oatmeal and it makes me nauseous and anxious just thinking about again. My question is, if something ever were to happen where I were to end up at a hospital, could they force me to recover? Admit me and force me to stabilize or tube me?

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you. I don't like the idea of veganism or cannibalism.

21,EatingDisorders,"I think I just want to share this to see if other people have had / are having a similar experience. 
I’ve physically recovered from anorexia, which i had been working towards for a good two years or so. Anyway, about a year ago my mum went on a diet in an attempt to lower her blood sugar. she did a great job and did end up lowering it as well as losing a very decent amount of weight too. Recently she’s laid off being too restrictive in her eating which makes sense since she reached her medical goal. The thing is, while she was on the diet i felt uneasy about it because it felt weird eating so much when she was eating so consciously and i also didn’t like the idea of her feeling like she had to lose weight. but now that it’s changed, i’ve found myself really anxious and overly aware of all her eating habits. Like, if she goes to get seconds or if she has a lot of treat food etc, i just notice. in my head i’m thinking “don’t do it, you don’t need it you want it” and all those dirty ed thoughts. i’m not sure what it is or what to do with it but it annoys me because i’d hate it if someone was thinking about my choices like that. I want to mention that i’m certain she has no idea about this, and i don’t want her to know because i would hate her to be self-conscious about it. It’s also worth noting that, sure sue has a bit of extra fat on her but i’m sure she wouldn’t even be classed as over weight. she eats very healthily 80% of the time so i’d say she actually has a very balanced diet. i think what pains me is the idea of her gaining the weight back and being disappointed? i feel like i might be projecting my own feelings onto her?

anyway, TLDR: my (overall healthy) mum has a sweet tooth and i can’t stop my intrusive thoughts about her eating when i see her pick up some treat food.",,Anxiety about loved one’s health / eating,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10nxkhg,1,kingkurtiss,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10nxkhg/anxiety_about_loved_ones_health_eating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10nxkhg/anxiety_about_loved_ones_health_eating/,1674962379,362,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,,,,,,
22,EatingDisorders,"I am very confused as to why my body reacts that way that it does to inconsistent nutrition. In no way am I starving myself but for someone reason if I miss breakfast or just whatever I struggle to eat later. It's like my body is fighting me against every bite.

I honestly have tried so many things to reduce the stress on my body- rapid breathing, yoga, exercise, sleeping early, trying not do do anything all day and just sit around, trying to eat consistently every few hours or so, masturbating, medications that are supposed to help with anxiety/depression.... I even tried having a romantic relationship with someone that I had probably shouldn't have because I thought maybe doing so (for the first time in my life) could somehow help me out of my predicament. I didn't follow through on that because it seemed a little illogical. 

I honestly hate being in this state because it's like I'm alive but can't actually have a life. I can't do so many things that I want to- some of which are just simple things like study and work- and in the absence of these I just don't know what the heck my life is worth. I've been this way for seven years and every day I wake up and think - today's going to be different, today somehow I'll have three decent meals and snacks and record my meals and I'll do what it takes to nourish my body. and every day WITHOUT FAIL, I DO NOT SUCCEED.

I used to be so ambitious and hardworking and felt like my life was in my hands but this issue has honestly stymied me on every front. I can't even understand why this keeps happening because I don't have an eating disorder mentality anymore and I want to have fun and live my life and meditate but I can't do any of these things because I always feel like something is off in my body but not like a medical diagnosis just a lack of adequate food and sleep. 

I don't understand how or why this happened. I just want it to be over and every day that goes by with me continuing to live like this just is worsening my health.

if i smell food, nausea, take one bite, nausea. it makes it very hard to actually sit down and eat, because everytime i finish i meal i feel like i’m about to throw up (i don’t want to). some days i have to sit disassociated on my couch for 15 minutes thinking very loudly “don’t throw up, don’t throw up” just to not, until it subsides. i’ve tried taking tums and that helps a little but not much.

33,EatingDisorders,"On and off for about 8 years now I’ve struggled with anorexia. In May 2022, it really got bad and since then I’ve restricted to only a few small “snacks” per day i.e., slice of pie at 11am, cup of yogurt at 9pm is pretty typical for me. If I have to eat a dinner for social reasons, I won’t eat all day long and the next day I’ll restrict further to make up for the large amount of food the day before. Anyway now I’m in recovery and I find that I feel like I’m going to vomit after eating. I think it might be because I’m having a larger food intake during the day, like a muffin in the morning, small snacks throughout the day and a proper dinner at night. For so long I haven’t adhered to breakfast, lunch and dinner, so I think it’s important in the recovery process to practice getting used to that again, and it has been a gradual build up to the food intake. But I’m just wondering, does anyone else feel like throwing up after eating? I’m not sure if it’s typical or something I’m doing wrong.

34,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone, over the last 3 years I have struggled pretty heavily with food. I'm gonna summarize what's happened so far, and will put my question after this paragraph if you want to skip.

I used to be very very obese, and I decided to start slowly eating better. I also started fasting. A few months into this, I went to the doctor, and got some scary blood work. An almost too high a1c. My lab numbers have always been bad, but the a1c sent me into a health anxiety tailspin. I kept cutting stuff out and eating less and less. I also slowly took on a keto diet. I also started regularly working out. I started to test my blood sugars all the time. I would even challenge myself by drinking a bunch of sugar water and testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours. My numbers were always normal. My fingers would be bruised all the time. Then, I started having some bad body symptoms. Basically a tremor. I freaked out and went to the doctor. Got a bunch of blood tests that showed malnutrition. I was asked about my caloric intake, and after thinking for a while I realized I was eating basically nothing. I started to bulk up my meals with low carb stuff: cheese, veggies, nuts, meat, and felt a lot better. Still tested my sugars whenever I ate carbs. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm close to a healthy weight now, all my numbers are pretty great, except my cholesterol is a touch high, but not as high as it was when I was heavy.

Well, now I'm concerned about my low carb diet, and I want to move toward a more balanced, healthy one. I'm terrified, because carbs equal blood sugar testing for me, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time. My concern is, could this just be an evolution of my disordered eating? Being so concerned with healthy foods that it's just bringing me out of a low carb diet and into a Mediterranean one? I'm so exhausted. This takes up most of my thoughts every day.

35,EatingDisorders,"TW - not sure if this is the thread to post in, but any advice is appreciated!

A close friend of mine has been struggling with disordered eating for a few years now but denies it, and whenever I feel like she is starting to get better, she seems to relapse again. 

She seems to get a lot of satisfaction from mentioning when she's gone a whole day without eating, and when she's lost weight or dropped clothing sizes. I don't know what to say or do, it's so worrying, and I feel like whenever I have tried to address it in the past it's gone nowhere. It's worse that I have always been the smaller friend despite my huge appetite, and she seems to compare herself to me. 

She makes out she is obsessed with health and tries all these fads like intermittent fasting and substituting meals for coffee/tea and 'health elixirs', but then she talks about how she's deficient in all these nutrients and never has any energy. It's like she intentionally overlooks the fact that her symptoms are because she doesn't eat properly... She also now claims she can't eat all these things because of self-diagnosed digestive issues (which I think she has also given herself by living off black coffee on an empty stomach...) 

I'm worried about her health, and our friendship hasn't been the same since her disordered eating (we often bonded over cooking and eating together, but these days when we hang out, she tries to fill our time with store-hopping or whatever else so we miss meal times and I end up so hangry by the end of it, despite my attempts to ask for a snack or meal break). Recently, one of our friends had a picnic for their birthday and she didn't eat anything because she claimed to have had a big meal beforehand.

36,EatingDisorders,"Hi all! First time visiting this community so apologies if I overstep any boundaries. 

My best friend since childhood struggles with binge eating disorder. I don’t know how many people in her life know, but I do know that she’s said before I’m one of the only people she feels comfortable talking to about it. (She has regular visits with a therapist- this is more of a “venting to a friend” type situation)

The thing is, I’ve never struggled with an eating disorder. I definitely have self-image issues and have been on some diets I probably shouldn’t have been, but nothing I would classify as an eating disorder. 

My main question is: how do I help? I love that she looks to me for encouragement, but I’m so scared of accidentally saying something that makes her feel worse even if it’s completely unintentional.

She texted me this morning that she binged last night for the first time in weeks and that she just needed someone to talk to about it. It took me nearly 20 minutes of just staring at the message to come up with a response because while I want to help and be someone she can talk to, I have truly no idea what to say. 

I guess my main question is if you were in her position, what would you want/need to hear from a friend offering support and comfort? Any phases or specific wording to avoid? I want her to continue to feel like she has a friend who she can talk to about this stuff but I’m completely lost on how to respond.

44,EatingDisorders,"Sorry for a really long post, I'm a bit scattered right now and it turned into a stream of consciousness. I think I'm just looking for reassurance/support?

I've had issues with a restrictive ED since I was a teenager, I've been self-recovered for a few years; I don't engage in the more severe disordered behaviours anymore, and I've got a handle on the more subtle ones most of the time. I'm a medically healthy weight, and I generally do my best to work through the negative self esteem stuff, but I would say that's probably the hardest part to shake off. I still have weeks here and there where I'm too ashamed of my appearance to leave the house. It's improved significantly this year, but I'm definitely not perfect.

I had deliberately avoided getting a doctor, dietician, or ED specialised therapist involved in my recoverg because I have some trauma stuff that makes me very afraid of medical/psych professionals, especially regarding ED/body image. But I did go to therapy during the first few years of recovery, just not to a specific ED treatment focused person. And that really helped me handle my thoughts and behaviour patterns, but of course a therapist can't really give nutrition advice, so I've been winging it as best as I can with the research available to me, but there's so much contradictory and questionable info out there.

This year in particular, I've been really wanting to get back into athletic hobbies (running and dance) because they used to bring me a lot of happiness and I really miss them. I know I'll need to give myself enough energy to handle the increase in activity but I feel honestly unequipped to navigate that on my own. So, I've started working with a dietician to get some outside support to make sure I won't burn myself out. She seems really grounded and knowledgeable, she knows about my ED history and is tailoring her approach with me to make sure she's not pushing me back into old habits. I think this is the right decision for me, but oh man am I ever nervous about it.

I'll be getting my first set of meal plans from her tomorrow and I'm really scared. It'll be a relief to have some structure and not have to stress over every decision myself, but I'm super nervous that I'm going to gain loads of weight and that it'll trigger a relapse. I know that she's not going to design a meal plan that would cause that, and I know I'm going to need to eat more if I want to increase my activity levels, but I'm having a lot of trouble shaking off the fear. I'm worried that every option (exercise, don't exercise, eat, don't eat) is going to somehow cause me to gain weight and be unhappy with myself forever.

47,EatingDisorders,"Hey Reddit!

I have been dealing with stress eating / emotional eating from few years. I completely lost hold of myself over the years as I ended up taking stress alot (an abusive relationship, another failed relationship, job related stress, not so peaceful home life, Covid era and the likes).

I have always loved food however this also meant with even a minute feeling of stress I would reach over to the food that is available to me at the earliest or my comfort food which is usually junk. I did not realise how this was impacting me until my weight tremendously increased. The effect is visible on my face, my belly, my arms the most. It was too late by the time I realised and now I genuinely do not know how to stop. 

I work a stressful job and I have constant hunger pangs and I reach out to food. No matter how hard I am trying I am unable to recover. 

Could you all please help me cope with this? I would really want to go back to my healthy self, please.

50,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone, I’m new to this subreddit and hoping to get some ideas from y’all. It might potentially be triggering though.

I’m recovered from anorexia-turned-bulimia (after 10 years) since 2010, then had three kids with various weight fluctuations, nothing major though. After my recovery I managed not to weigh myself at all and eat pretty much intuitively for almost another 10 years. That is until I had a complicated/high risk third pregnancy in 2020. Suddenly regular weigh-ins were required by my doctors and I wasn’t allowed to exercise or get my heart rate up at all. The postpartum period was tough as well. 

I ended up with chronic hypertension, messed up blood fat levels and a pretty high body fat percentage. I’m expressly not asking for advice on these medical issues, just mentioning them for context. The point is: my current doctor advised that I lose weight and I’m really unsure how to go about that.

I’ve tried implementing more veggies in my diet and cutting back on fats and sugars without measuring anything, but the thought alone that I *have to* lose weight now is triggering binges and intense guilt whenever I eat something „unhealthy“. It feels like fighting fire with fire. If I lost weight and lowered my blood pressure, but relapsed into an ED, it wouldn’t exactly help my overall health either.

So my question is: 
Is there a „safe“ way for recovered ED patients to lower their weight?",,Trying to lose weight as a (somewhat) recovered ED patient,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10l8avh,1,Freya1390,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10l8avh/trying_to_lose_weight_as_a_somewhat_recovered_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10l8avh/trying_to_lose_weight_as_a_somewhat_recovered_ed/,1674677325,242,0,0,0,-1,1,Doctor advising weight loss for a recovered ED patient,harmful,"Feeling triggered by the idea of weight loss and experiencing guilt and binges when eating ""unhealthy"" foods, Concerned that losing weight could cause a relapse of the ED",Doctor advising weight loss after medical issues,harmful,"Being advised to lose weight is triggering binges and intense guilt, Uncertainty about how to safely lose weight without relapsing into an eating disorder",Doctor advising weight loss for medical reasons,,"The idea of having to lose weight is triggering binges and intense guilt around food, Concerns about relapsing into an eating disorder if weight loss is pursued, Asking for advice on whether there is a ""safe"" way for recovered ED patients to lower their weight"
51,EatingDisorders,"Hey! So I'm about 2 weeks in recovery and slowly putting some weight on and logically I'm aware that that's a good thing, because I was very underweight and I should gain so that I can be a healthy weight. But. With a healthier weight come rolls. One of the many reasons why I did what I did is that I couldn't bear the feeling of skin/fat rolls when I slouched. I don't know how to be ok with having rolls when I bend or slouch, or pose myself in a sort of ""shrimp"" position. The sensation of light pressure the rolls give me makes me feel absolutely horrible. I know that the only reason I had basically no rolls before is that because I was severely underweight, but that doesn't stop me from feeling horrendous about having them now. It's more about the bodily sensation than the body image issues, I just can't stand the physical feeling at all.

.

.

I have been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now with on and off recovery which never lasts long. 

In 2020 when covid hit i gained a bit of weight and became depressed then developed and ED, I have told my bsf about it and tbh she was not very understanding of it, she is one of those people who think its my chice and i could just eat. I obv can't change someone's thoughts and believes so i never really bothered. later that year i decided to start recovery and i mentioned it to her, while all my family were supportive of this decision, one time i was showing her my breakfast ( we used to send each other daily vlogs and stuff) and mentioning how I'm starting to be healthier and bla bla bla, she them replied back with ""OH MY GOD! You eat sooo much food wow, that's probably as much as my brother, wow."" This was the most triggering thing someone ever commented on my food. the thing is my ""big"" breakfast was too hard boiled eggs, 2 low carb crackers and a bunch of veggies... 

i felt sooooo guilty and i believed that it is too much and always been afraid to eat like that in fear of being perceived like so. Anyways, needless to say that it made me relapse immediately and honestly thinking of recovering is never serious as it was back then. 

The thing here is , she knows I've relapsed and i never really talked about my ed with her ever since. However, she still to this day says the most triggering things ever. Like ''Oh, i haven't eaten since yesterday."" ""I haven't eaten for 24hrs"" ""I only had tea for breakfast"" and so more of these, the thing is she does not have an ed... she just likes to brag like some of those people, and she knows that i have an ed and she still brags to me. 

she sometimes checks on me if i ate or not and all that but it doesn't really differ when i know that she believes I'm pathetic and ""its all my choice""

70,EatingDisorders,"I’m currently classified as EDNOS. My eating disorder used to swing back and forth between binge eating phases and extreme restriction phases. My binge eating was very unhealthy but it used to provide a big comfort to me in stressful times. 
Now days I’m attempting to work on things and eat correctly. When I feel stressed or upset, I feel the desire to binge and sometimes I’ll even prepare binge food, but I’ll take a couple bites and then become disgusted with the food. My brain will start telling me, “You already ate 3 meals today. That’s already so much more than I’m comfortable with! Stop right now!”
Often I’ll end up throwing away the binge food. Then I’ll go sit down somewhere. But since I’m still stressed, my brain will eventually start telling me I’m hungry again because it wants the rush from a binge. But that same brain also won’t let me binge any more?? It’s all so confusing.
I know I need to eat, but because I’m eating more, my eating disorder will NOT allow me to eat any more than my meal plan allows. So I’m left without both ED coping mechanisms.
Obviously neither restriction nor binging are good copying skills. I don’t want to engage in either one. I’m autistic and when I feel like I’m gonna have a meltdown, I used to pacify myself with binging. Now I feel repulsed by the idea of binging, which is good in some ways.

74,EatingDisorders,"I know this sounds ridiculous, but hear me out.

Since the day I was born, the only food my family has had in the house is unhealthy. It's cakes, sugars, pizzas, meat (and I'm vegetarian), just all kinds of crackers and snacks. My family isn't well off at all so all the money I make at my part-time job (I'm in high school) goes straight to our bills, I can't buy my own food. My parents buy us fast food every day. I watch TV shows where kids beg their parents for McDonald's and are so overjoyed when their parents buy it for them and I can't believe that's relatable for most kids. 

Everyone in my family is overweight except me.. because of my eating disorder. 

But it wasn't always like that, because up until I was about 11, I was overweight, too. Then I learned more about health and begged my parents to buy healthy food or make actual meals for us instead of just telling us to make microwave pancakes for dinner, or at least regulate what we eat and when, put a limit, anything, but they refused. I decided that I'd rather not eat anything than eat junk. 

As I got older and began to care about my looks more, the reasoning behind my starving turned more onto trying to avoid looking how the rest of my family looks - I do want to be thin. But it's been five or six years of this and I'm out of energy and I've lost my period and I have panic attacks and meltdowns over Cheez-Its and no one knows. I haven't told anyone. 

But I don't want this anymore. I want to be able to eat, because I don't want to die. 

But I don't want to eat unhealthily either, because again, I don't want to die. 

If I ever told my parents, they would just see it as ""oh, she needs to eat more"" and force me to eat their unhealthy snacks. I want to be healthy. I want to live normally. But no one can help me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first met my gf she was still with her ex-bf of 4 years, but they had had a lot of issues and were always fighting so she wanted to break up with him but she felt bad thinking he would be sad about it. So she didn't leave him until some time after.

&amp;#x200B;

We started to get along and to meet more often, and eventually we showed attraction for each other and some night, probably drunk, we... did stuff. At that time I was really uncomfortable with my body already but knowing someone was attracted to me kinda helped to get through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Time passed and she eventually broke up with her ex, she had always told me she really liked me and would like to have a relationship but she couldn't because she was still with the guy. At this point I knew she would need time to be alone, to heal from her past, toxic relationship before getting into another one so I did that, gave her time.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually it was her bday and she made a party where she invited some of her highschool friends, she told me she used to fancy this one girl who was coming but she hadn't seen in a long time, and I thought nothing of it. Little did I know, she (my now gf) ended up getting drunk and making out with the girl she fancied in front of me.

A week went by and she stopped giving me any attention when we were together and she was even more distant now, she spent the time we were together texting the girl in question and sending her love messages and stuff. She was never very affectionate with me whatsoever.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I stopped talking to her at all. It made me feel extremely bad. I knew the other girl was hotter than me and prettier than I am and I was so jealous because of course she would rather be with her, I would too.

&amp;#x200B;

Some time after she texted me saying that she didn't know what happened or why we weren't okay (as in our friendship) and I ended up meeting with her. I had got a girlfriend at this point but I really, deep down, loved her so, after more rounds of gin that I can count, I ended up cheating on my gf.

&amp;#x200B;

So to finish this story, I broke up with my ex-gf and started dating her, and they lived happily ever after.

&amp;#x200B;

FALSE, those things that happened still haunt me to the date and I spent last night crying and couldn't sleep at all thinking about it and it has grown a lot of anxiety in me. I also I'm at my worst with my ED right now so I feel really bad overall.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, the reason to this post is she is meeting with the girl she changed me with next Wednesday and I can't shake the thought that she preferred her over me. This is really triggering to me and I refuse to it anything until everything has passed. How can I get over what happened? Or how can I make it less triggering?

76,EatingDisorders,"My best friend (I'll call her S) told our friend group that she's been struggling with anorexia for a year over three months ago. We all really really want to help her but she's struggling so much. And I think I'm making it worse.

S is fragile and emotionally unstable, just in a very bad headspace. My husband and I have been taking on most of the effort in helping her recover. She stays with us most of the time and feels comfortable in our home. She's been making a small amount of progress, but she dips a lot and will relapse constantly. 

But last week I got into a big argument with one of our other friends. She (I'm gonna call her D) says that I'm hurting S just by being around her and I need to let more of the group be involved in her recovery.  

I've always been a very thin girl and many times throughout my life I've been told I look like I have an eating disorder. It's not something I've ever personally dealt with though. On a few occasions, S has said she wants to look like me. I always tell her I would rather her look like herself.

So D and I got into this fight, and when I told my husband, he actually agreed. I asked S and she said I'm not a problem, but I'm not sure I can trust her judgment about this.

I really really need advice. Am I actually making her fail her recovery? Do I need to take myself out of the picture?

79,EatingDisorders,"Apologies if this ain't the place for this kinda question and I'll axe the post if so. Also wanna say I ain't no shrink or ED expert so I'm spitballing on a lotta this.

My girlfriend has been showing what I believe to be signs of distorted body image (again, not an expert). She ain't obese or nothing but is a bit on the plump side, and I love that about her. But she makes frequent comments about how she eats too much, and not like once or twice; seems like it's damn near every meal we have together. I've also caught her looking at herself in the mirror a couple of times in what's obviously a body check, though I didn't say nothing about it at the time. She does go to the gym and sometimes we even go together since we both love doing it but she ain't obsessive about it. She ain't there 7 days a week or nothing.

Thing is we ain't been together all that long so I’m still figuring out what she responds to and how she communicates, and it feels rude asking straight up about it at this stage. What I really want to do is tell her how sexy she is but I know some folks don't like being told they're wrong about themselves even if it’s meant to be encouraging, plus I figure a topic like this could get dicey real fast so misstepping this early on could mean stepping on a landmine. What I do now is laugh a bit at her comments about herself with a half-joking ""now that's just crazy talk"" kinda response. Usually she laughs but I wonder if that's really helping.

Also don't know if this matters at all but she's Pakistani and was raised Muslim and another friend of mine from that part of the world told me it ain't uncommon for young women to get negative comments about their figures, skin tone, and just about everything else from their own family coming up. I know that happens stateside all the time but apparently it can get pretty nasty over there. Ain't met her family so got no clue if that's true about her though.

Would like any input, especially from folks who also struggled with body image shit and what your partners, friends or family did or didn’t do that genuinely helped. Some other folks in other subs mentioned complimenting things like her intellect or the clothes she wore that day (things she chooses) and I been doing that. Seems like it helps.

80,EatingDisorders,"I guess we are in this sub because of the conscious fear of eating and gaining weight, so to be like “How do I become comfy with myself” is rhetorical, but really, I just want to be comfortable in my body for once in my life. I go through phases where I am okay not having a completely flat stomach and carrying a little extra weight, and in these periods of my life I am usually the happiest… but then the self loathing kicks in and feeling valueless for not looking “perfect” anymore. Since starting college and finding career and academic success, I have gained a lot of self confidence and I feel worthy in a way I never had… I think it made me less reliant on my looks for the feeling of validity, so that has been positive for me. But, the feeling that I’m not valuable unless I look a certain way won’t go away. The reality is I can’t be successful in school and restrict, I am someone who needs carbs and “bad” food to have clarity of mind and conscious productive thinking. Career is more important than a bit of extra weight. Like I get that. And in effect trying to exist and attain balance with my brain and body and treat myself compassionately, it’s caused some weight gain, which is starting to bother me and cause me a lot of stress.
So yeah idk. I also try and rationalize the “WHY” I feel this way. So basically by obsessing over my body and appearance, I’m supporting capitalism that profits off women when I buy diet foods to get skinny and beauty products promising to smooth my skin and fix my face. The market sets the beauty standard, exploits our narcissism, and profits off it. I just don’t want to be a part that, but I think it’s impossible to disconnect. Anyways yeah idk, I wish I wasn’t a woman and didn’t have to deal with this. I take comfort in that even when I was my skinniest, I was also the unhappiest I’ve ever been.

81,EatingDisorders,"8 months ago, I decided it was time for me to loose weight because I kept being told “you’re getting chubby” and whenever I ate too much chocolate, chips, ramen noodles and other things I loved, I was told “you’re gonna get fat” and was even told “your stomach is getting bigger”. I never cared about how much I ate, what I ate. I ate whatever I wanted and as much as I wanted. 

But after deciding to loose weight, I started eating as little as possible. Restricted myself from sugar, any junk food. Tried eating healthy and mostly veggies. Did an hour of workouts 6 times a week and eventually reduced it to 5 times a week. Ate 3 meals a day after every 3-4 and didn’t eat anything else after 8PM (my third meal would be before 8PM and that’s it). I started seeing results of loosing weight. It made me really happy because I started fitting in more nice clothes and was getting happier with my body. 

The thing is that I lost my period after like 3 months of the start of my journey to this. Started loosing a lot of weight and was having no trouble. Whenever I saw any junk food or any other food, I wouldn’t be feeling like eating it. I had control. Didn’t even crave junk foods anyway. 

Because I had lost so much weight and my period, my aunt got worried and took me to the doctor. The doctor weighed me and said I was underweight for my age and height. But I didn’t care anyways and continued to eat little and workout. 

But on my 8 month of my journey, which was on December 29, during the holidays, I started to binge. The binge happened on new years Jan 1st when I had to go to a family event and they gave me sweets. I told myself “I haven’t had any sugary thing for months and since this is a family one time thing I should enjoy myself” so I ate a cookie that was on the table, then ate another, then another and another. Then ate many of the fruits on the table. And after I was done, my stomach felt so full. 

After that day, in the next day, I ate more than usual. I love having oatmeal for breakfast and I always have it like every other day and only once a day. The next day I ate 2 oatmeal’s, one in the morning, one at night. I started having oatmeal everyday after that and ate 2 then eventually went to 3. Then I started eating junk food. Ate so many chocolate that was given to me during the holiday gifts, then ate so much Nutella, and chips with cream cheese. I kept basically binging. 

After the holiday weeks break was over for me (Jan 9), I said I’m gonna get back on track and eat healthy again. So I did for 5 days and had control of myself. After 5 days, I started to binge again till now. My stomach is getting bigger again and I’m scared to gain all the weight I had 8 months ago back again. I still worked out 5 times a week during the holidays while I was binging, and still am to this day. But the binging is making my stomach get bigger and my face chubbier. I don’t want to get back to how I used to look like. 

Recently I had to give a blood test because my doctor told me to since I still don’t have my period back yet for about 6-7 months and he said I need to reduce my workout to 2 times a week and eat more.

On the other hand, I keep binging and have no control even though I keep telling myself “this is my last binge I won’t do it again tomorrow”. Basically with the binging I am eating more. However, the fact that my stomach is getting bigger and my face puffier, it makes me feel guilty after every binge. I still workout 5 times a week but it’s 20-40 minutes a day. I don’t know how I was so consistent and no food made me loose control but after the holidays I lost control of myself. 

The doctor did tell me to eat more, and I want to listen but with the eating more, I want to eat healthier not binge on chocolate chips, so much peanut and almond butter and other things.

She has support; and lots of it, so I am so confused as to why she wants to constantly tell people how bad things are getting for her.

How can I help direct her to talk about her feelings instead of her behaviors?

She has completely disregarded my own triggers in all of this, and is very upset with me for setting boundaries with her regarding my own triggers saying no one else has reacted the way I have.

87,EatingDisorders,"Hello! Looking for some advice on a how to help my sister who struggles with anorexia and bulimia. This has been an ongoing issue since her teenage years, she’s now in her late 30’s and has been in and out of recovery over the last years. With the biggest scare being about 8 years ago when her blood levels became so out of wack she almost succumbed to her eating disorders. Over the last year I have noticed some things that have made me question where she is currently at in her recovery process but know how tender the subject is and have never pressed the issue. 
Then comes tonight when her 16 year old daughter, my niece, comes to my mom and I in desperation for help for her and her mom. She’s beyond worried about her mother whom she states is barely eating and when she does is vomiting. Talking about no food in the house (she herself looked quite gaunt tonight and was asking for food… que the pizza lol), and how her mom has overall been acting off lately and treating her differently as well. 
Looking for any advice on how to handle this situation and how to get my sister the help she needs. Us as a family would do anything to help her but don’t know where to start and the last thing we want to do is push her away or make her angry with her daughter for coming to us.

88,EatingDisorders,"Hi, First post. Today I tried to talk to my girlfriend about her eating disorder and it went terribly. Backstory; I have known about her eating disorder for awhile, I just didn't realize the severity until a few days ago. I was importing a picture to draw over on procreate and in her camera roll(it is her ipad) i saw screenshots of my location which freaked me out, i struggle with sever anxiety, so i scrolled up to see if there were anymore and instead I found a lot of pro ana posts she has saved, i stopped here and since then i have been trying to find a way to talk about it. Today i did , I told her what I saw, I know its a sensitive subject so I didn't want to pry, I told her that if she ever wanted to ralk I am here and that I want us to have an open communication about this. she went silent for awhile and iasked if we could talk about it and she said that she never wants to talk about this and said i was snooping. she wont sleepin the same bed as me now. i dont know what to do. i am not going to force her to talk about it, i am just reallt scared of losing her to something like this. please any advice is welcome. i feel like i have ruined everything, and that she will never trust me again.",,help,1,one,question,,,,t5_2qpcj,10hjpq7,1,burnnnnner0101010111,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10hjpq7/help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10hjpq7/help/,1674279053,248,0,0,1,-1,1,Discovery of pro ana posts on girlfriend’s iPad,unknown,"Girlfriend became defensive and refused to discuss her eating disorder, Girlfriend is now avoiding sleeping in the same bed as the writer",Discovery of pro ana posts on girlfriend’s device,harmful,"Girlfriend becomes defensive and refuses to talk about her eating disorder, Relationship becomes strained and girlfriend doesn’t want to sleep in the same bed",Discovering pro ana posts on girlfriend’s iPad,unknown,"Attempted to talk to girlfriend about her eating disorder, but it went terribly, Girlfriend became defensive and accused the writer of snooping, Girlfriend is now refusing to sleep in the same bed"
89,EatingDisorders,"So, just a little info: I’ve been vegetarian for 5 years, and went vegan about 2 years in and kept it up for about 2 more years. I realized being vegan, for me, was a little restrictive as I have some texture aversions and don’t like a lot of things (still veg), so a lot of times I wouldn’t eat at events or nights out. I definitely noticed a bit of disordered eating going on. It wasn’t normal, I looove food. I love eating!

Pretty often, probably like once a week or every two weeks this past year, I would throw up from being so hungry. Or, even if I wasn’t starving, just knowing that I’d have to go to a restaurant and eat something, even just imagining the smell or smelling it, made me sick and I’d have to go throw up in the bathroom mid-meal.

I’ve been absolutely wonderful the last probably 2-3 months and have been eating healthy, good amounts and didn’t feel sick or weird once. Never even thought about it. It’s been great.

Now, I’ve been really depressed for the entirety of the last week, and haven’t been eating. It got to a point where I was so hungry I threw up bile 2 days ago. I was sad again yesterday and only ate a few veggie sausages to start my day, and then was SO hungry later, and after I got and ate a few fries, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up.

Is there a label to out on this or? I’ve had an extremely sensitive, queasy stomach since I had COVID, so maybe that’s it. I don’t know.

I try to eat consistently (snacking) to avoid getting so starving, but I don’t want anything. I quit one of my jobs so I have a lot of time now and that always throws me off. I need routine.

Anyway, thanks to anyone reading.

90,EatingDisorders,"Hi, this is, I believe, my first post and I need some help. I suspect one of my siblings may have had an eating disorder for a while now, but I don't know how to help. Although we have mentioned how this said sibling has gotten thinner and skipped meals and such, my mom makes every excuse to stray away from the idea that her child might need help. She either points out the things he has eaten or just stays silent and changes the subject. I fear for my sibling because he did lose a lot of weight in comparison to last year, almost unrecognizable, but I guess he sees it as a good thing because he is a lot more talkative during school. From what I have seen, he drinks A LOT of water bottles, even one time mentioning to us that if we ever wanted to lose weight just drink water until your stomach hurts. I do not know why these talks seem so normal in our family.

I might suspect I have an eating disorder myself too but how can I help someone when I do not even know how to take care of myself? It is very stressful to see him need help but no help being given. I don't want to believe that my mom is a bad parent, but it is just communication and showing affection are two things that my family struggles with.

92,EatingDisorders,"so i (20 m) have struggled with eating disorders on and off for several years, and have recently been starting to feel myself relapsing, although i’m not shocked as it’s my first year at college and that’s obviously stressful for various reasons. (not that it matters but i’m currently in the supposed “healthy” weight range.)

i have a close friend (i’m gay and she’s a lesbian so it’s not romantic in any sense) at school who i hang out with a lot since we’re on the same floor. she tends to be a very physically affectionate person, (as in cuddling, hugging, leaning on you, etc). there’s a few things regarding boundaries i know i need to talk to her about, but theres one specifically that i have no idea how to bring up. 

basically if we’re like hugging or cuddling she always talks about how i’m so “comfy” and “squishy” and “warm” which i know she means as like a good thing? but it really triggers me honestly. i feel so stupid for being bothered by it, but it’s difficult when i’m already struggling to figure out how to establish boundaries without hurting her.

 for context, while i of course enjoy hanging out with her, she definitely has attachment problems and has talked a lot about probably having bpd, and it’s not like i’d ever judge her for that, but in the case that she does have bpd, i am very clearly her fp and i’m nervous about how she’d react because there’s been a handful of occasions where she’s gotten clearly upset with me even over things like me not wanting to hang out because i’m not doing well or i need to go to bed earlier. she’ll get very snippy and will barely talk to or acknowledge me, and contrasted with her being over the top affectionate and saying she loves me every few minutes (which also kinda makes me uncomfortable), it makes me feel like such an asshole. 

 i know i need to talk to her about stuff but i have genuinely never told anyone i’ve struggled with an ed, although i’ve vaguely mentioned having had “issues with food” when talking with a few people, her including her. i’m honestly just afraid that if i try to talk to her about stuff, i’ll end up leaving out how uncomfortable i feel when she makes these specific comments about my appearance/body (which happens several times a week)

93,EatingDisorders,"I really need advice. I (16f) have a close friend (15f). We were best friends for several years, but covid just sort of distanced us. We still see each other and talk occasionally, but not on the level we did before. A few days ago, I was on twitter when I saw two old tweets I had bookmarked last year. They were both from the same account, one was about something that had happened at my school last year, and the other was complaining about the weather in my state. I thought it was odd that the person lives in my state and had the same thing happen to them at their school. I figured we probably went to the same school, and when I clicked on the account I realized it was an eating disorder twitter account. I didn't recognize the girls name, and when I asked a few friends, neither did they, and I forgot all about it. 

Until a few days ago when I found the tweets again and went back on the account, and noticed the way she tweeted was very similar to the way my 15f friend types. But the account had her age on the account and said she was 16 in her bio, so I figured it was just coincidence. But then I scrolled down and saw tweets from a few days before, where she thanked everyone for all the birthday wishes, and that's when i remembered my friend had just turned 16. As soon as I realized they had the same birthday, I just knew it was her and my heart dropped. 

Right now I don't know what to do. I don't want to confront her, because I'm worried she might try to hurt herself out of panic. Should I tell my mom so she can tell her mom? I don't really want her knowing I'm the one who told, but idk I'd rather her be mad at me then be dead or anorexic. I struggled with an eating disorder in the past and know I would have felt better with someone knowing, but I would have completely freaked out if someone found out on their own. I just feel really bad and want to tell someone.

96,EatingDisorders,"I (14F) and my Best friend (14F) met eachother a few months ago. We get along really well and I love her so much but recently i found out that she has anorexia. 

Some time ago i installed Tumblr and asked her if she could give me her username. I'm pretty sure she Hestitated for some time but still gave me her username. When I saw her posts i literally froze. 

The whole account was about her anorexia, pictures of her body (She has visible bones everywhere) and starvation diet.

Some time ago she did told me she had anorexia but i was sure it was all in the past. So i started asking her about it and everytime she posted something I couldn't have a normal conversation with her without saying something about her ED. 

I started wondering if maybe i should message her parents about it (From what i know she has a good relationship with them and they had to deal with her ED before) but i was scared she might get upset about it, so i told her I'm considering talking to her parents. 

She was a bit upset and told me about her ex friend who actually told her parents about her ED and that when she found out about it she started to dislike that person. 

I really don't want to lose her but I just can't stop worrying about it.

97,EatingDisorders,"Hi all,

I will not mention any numbers but I am curious if anyone has a similar experience. I have found each time I've relapsed I usually gain a bit of weight and then it tapers off over the following months. I shouldn't be surprised I guess that after almost a year of health problems that triggered a nearly year-long relapse is causing a similar effect. I am now at a weight I haven't been in 3 years since I was in the first two years of recovery and allowed myself to be overweight...this is a very scary thing for me and I'm trying to remain calm and not act drastically but I'm finding myself very triggered. I have a different mindset on recovery and my body after 5 years of recovery with various blips, i truly feel like i have learned...but you never know, ya know? I am tempted to ask my doctor to do some testing on me as I am concerned with the shear amount of weight in such a short amount of time with literally all that was done was just stop restricting, meaning i eat like a normal person (I have autoimmune gut disorders so not that normal but eat enough and can't eat inflammatory foods). The second qaundry is is there safe weight loss after recovery? I feel like most times I've gone at it like that I've ended up falling into old habits but now I am overweight (which you know obviously isn't the worst thing and i can still be healthy) and some of my abilities are obstructed.

I’ve been struggling with restrictive eating for a long time now.

It got better while i was overseas and i began eating 3 meals a day again and I thought everything was getting better and I didn’t have to exercise everyday if i ate but since ive been back I’ve been restricting again- almost feeling like j have to make up for the fact that i ate so much on my trip. I havent eaten anything in two days atp and while i always know i should, its almost paralysing bc i weirdly feel proud of myself for holding out for so long and also not feeling  hungry? I also feel like bc I haven’t had the motivation to workout I shouldnt eat much to make up for it which I KNOW logically is so wrong but when i tell myself i know i have to eat or get something in me, i just feel like i cant move, like my body is resisting it.

103,EatingDisorders,"I've been in a quasi-recovery state: so I wouldn't say entirely recovered, and still have a lot of progress to make regarding becoming more recovered. 

My therapist (she's wonderful), is not trained in eating disorders- just because at the current time while in school full time and also working full time- I don't have the ability to see a clinician that fully addresses eating disorders in their practice, and can not afford the ability to seek out a nutritionist or doctor. My therapist knows to the extent of what my eating disorder has looked like before- the severity, and also knows the intensity of interventions used before (i.e IP, Res, ACUTE, OP, IOP,) several times-- so I'm assuming she is aware right now while recently being in quasi (within the last year or so)- that a relapse or ""mini-lapse"" could occur. 

My therapist has told me to reach out to the crisis line if in a crisis- or out to her: which I have done a couple times regarding a situation with my partner (where he wasn't okay)- but other than that I have not reached out at all regarding food- I think for a weird reason, I feel uncomfortable reaching out to her about food, because I've had other therapists who have directly told me ""reach out regarding food if you are not okay"", and with her I feel like I have to be more ""put together"" than I am right now, because it's embarrassing to acknowledge that I'm slipping. 

Recently my partner, has been struggling with his own mental health (developed the symptom of psychosis), and on top of the academics I'm taking, as well as my three jobs- I've gotten really stressed out, to the point of engaging in behaviors: I want to address this with her, and I also want to be able to reach out to her in the moment, but I am weirdly concerned that she would sort of 'fire me' for the relapsing- or just not know what to do- because eating disorders are not in her scope of practice. I also know that she could potentially not do that, because I'm at a point where I'm about to drop one of my 19 credits- and cut the hours on one of my jobs, so I can sort of get into a less stressed out mindset, and recenter myself into a recovery oriented mindset.

104,EatingDisorders,"Lots of exposition, so beware.

I'm 20 years old, and I just dropped out of college. I've struggled with an eating disorder for about 6 years, and I've gone through the same cycle over and over again. Overeat, gain, feel sorry for myself, hoard and hide food, fight with my family, promise to be better and get help, I get help, I don't try, then I just go back to eating again. 

It's just been a constant cycle of failure after failure, and that's all on me. I couldn't even make it through the first semester of college because I blew through my savings on food. 

I'm at the point where something has to change, or else I'll just be like this for the rest of my life. My parents have given me chance after chance after chance. They've put up with my false promises and failures and then I drag myself back pleading for forgiveness, and another chance, and they give it. This is my last shot. I'm living with them while I get help, but if it doesn't work, I need to find another place to live and find a way to live with this ED. 

I'm going to go to therapy (first session is next week). What would be the first steps after that? I understand that I need to find the root of the issue (hence a psychologist), but while I do that, what are some good practices to include in my life? Do I focus on weight loss? Do I focus on forming healthy eating habits? Both at once? 

I just don't know where to start, because I'm so worried it will end up being a waste.

I would have random episodes of binge eating until I am physically ill from the amount of garbage I have put in myself, but still am unable to stop. That would cause me to feel shame and utter disgust with myself and the way I would pig out on shitty food to feel comfort. Eventually, I realised I do that whenever I'm going through a tough period or when I feel a lot of stress. Due to this behaviour, I would stop eating for days. E.g I would eat and apple and that would be my meal for the entire day. The pain of being hungry would be so strong that I just fall back into the same spiral and binge until I can't fit anything in my stomach. It caused me pain, disgust, shame and contributed to having poor mental health and self-esteem issues. I feel so weak for this because I cannot fathom how something can control me and my life this much up to a point where it affects my entire day and every waking hour. What should I do?

To give some back history; i had my son a little over a year and a half ago, when I got pregnant with him i was really struggling, to the point of where my primary doctor and mother had a sit down intervention type of deal and basically told me to get my sh- together or go get the tube and some more intensive rehab…Of course I took the latter, didn’t have much choice in the matter due to the fact I also got pregnant with my little dude not even a few weeks later… I started to get healthier mentally and emotionally and physically as well and things seemed so good! Then literally the complete and total unthinkable happened, the father of my son died out of no where via what they claimed as suicide but the entire thing was fishy and multiple sources close to him were telling me it was a set up..that’s besides the point..a year and a half later after genuinely grieving not only my best friend but father of my sons death as well as other close circle friends who ended up dying tragically..I’m here crawling myself out of a deep pit of depression, past drug addiction, recovery after ECT (for those of you who don’t know what that is it’s probably a therapy that should be illegal… or at least more regulated..) and just being a young mom and college student… it’s a balance for sure!!

didn’t know what to do and of course went to a really expensive and almost occultist type vibe promising “a perfect daughter”, i kid you not the thing wasn’t even on google maps at the time, they did a lot of illegal shit which I actually found out about after I had gotten myself out and reconnected with old peers (story for another time) anyways; now a days I struggle.

I struggle with eating. Usually i don't eat whole day and then i over eat at night.
It usually start with having no appetite in morning and when i skip breakfast im usually in not eating mood for rest of the day.

It just seems like nothing is appetizing. All i see are ingredients that need work to turn them into meals, but there is no motivation to do that. This post could also be titled as ""too lazy to eat"". I think that when i have some meals prepared from earlier i don't struggle that much to eat them. It also seems like the ""task"" of making decision of what to eat is just too hard for me to make so i rather starve.

But back to the mornings. Today was kind of exception because i actually got up early which is something i'm striving for, but since i got up early, I had to face the decision of what should i eat. 
As usual i opened fridge and realised that i don't feel like eating anything. I dint want to eat anything savory or sweet, so I decided to eat something ""neutral"" like oatmeal (boiled in water with pinch of salt). We didn't have oats at home so I went to store and when I got there and looked at all the different food I got appetite back and wanted to eat. 

It's usually like that... At home I struggle to decide but when I'm out it just get easier, maybe it's due to lack of decision making.

112,EatingDisorders,"For as long as I can remember I've had what I would qualify as a bit of a weird relationship with food. I feel like this relationship results in unhealthy habits and behaviours. I have googled my ""symptoms"" extensively but haven't come up with anything yet so I thought I would take it to this group to see if anyone can relate and/or provide insights. 

My ""symptoms"" mostly revolve around an obsession with food portions which expresses itself in the following ways :
- A feeling of scarcity. I feel the need to cook enough food for the possibility of having seconds. If there is only enough food to provide a ""regular"" portion to everyone eating, I feel anxiety. Even if I have enough to eat, I feel satiated at the end of the meal and I have no intentions of grabbing seconds.
- A strong dislike for sharing food. My portions are MY portions. Unless we're at a restaurant and sharing is the only way I get to try different items on the menu. 
- In addition to the above, if I'm cooking and serving the food - the food has to be divided equally between me and my significant other. Even though his calorie requirements are much higher than mine. And I'm embarrassed to say this, but I struggle not to take more food or keep the best bits of the meal for myself when serving.
- If I share food someone, I must have the last bite.
- Some food hoarding 

I have absolutely no idea where this is all coming from and the weird thing too is that my sister seems to be sharing some of these issues. Growing up she also struggled with binge eating while I don't remember really suffering from that. We grew up in a lower middle household and we absolutely never went hungry. We grew up on non fancy, homemade meals and ate out sometimes as a family. We had access to fresh food and treats/sweets as well. Our parents did not restrict food intake.

I'd love to hear people's thoughts on this. Thank you in advance!

As I open my eyes and see my mom wake me up “Kai get up” and so I do I go in the kitchen Open the fridge refill my water bottle I see my favorite chips on the counter I hear a voice in the back of my head her name is Anna “ no you must resist temptation you wanna be beautiful right no one will love you if you’re a fat ugly cow” so I don’t do it I go to school go through my first few classes I had a lunch I walked on the stairs as normal every day the same never  any difference I walk outside where my friend Sam and favorite person Ian is and Ian offers me a chip and I say no thank you i’m not hungry 
Sam knowing about Anna she says come on Kai you have to eat something it was always in these moments and I realized Anna was me I was just telling myself that no one would love me and eating only cost pain because of what has happened to me laying and my family calling  me fat it all hurt so badly that I had this vision everything was black and white so easy to avoid i had manipulated myself into believing a something so stupid something that was so hard not to believe so many things spinnings through my head out once I come back to reality it sees that you know I’m looked confused and sound saying go on you have to eat go get lunch And so I walk off come back later with no lunch fast forward to it because it’s winter break so my friends can’t be monitoring how much I eat  my parents never really cared my sister’s notice when I didn’t eat so I had to eat something and then when I would eat at the end of the day at two in the morning when everyone else was asleep I would walk into the bathroom I guess I almost saw it as a punishment as if everything was my fault and so I threw up this has been every night for the past two weeks no one knows about it and as far as I can help no one ever will but maybe if I told someone it would help I know I’m not alone, I know this is how other people feel but even then I feel so isolated like it’s purely my problem I always feel like I’m alone I have friends and I have people who care about me it would kill them to see me like this but I don’t wanna involve them in my problems my problems are mine to deal with not there they already have enough going wrong for them

It happens, but I’m working hard now to get better (and you should too!) anyways, I have a friend I’ll call B. B, like way too many teenage girls, has gotten sucked into diet culture. I know I should probably just get over it, but it’s really upsetting to me when she says things like “all I’ve eaten today is *insert small amount of food*” again, I know that not everyone will always accommodate my triggers, but when it’s a close friend it’s a little trickier. I never told her about my eating disorder because I tried my best to keep things under wraps. Not that it’s anything to be embarrassed about, it’s just kind of hard to talk about, and people can be not so nice. I care about B, and if she has a serious eating disorder, I want her to get help, but I just can’t be that person for her.

My husband has some disordered eating habits of his own but in a different way. He’s very diet focused and will fast if it means hitting a weight goal, things like that. He doesn’t see what he has as an ED, which is fine I’m not a doctor but it’s still harmful behavior sometimes.

But he says things that are very triggering for someone who is recovering. For instance like I’ll eat like a candy bar or something and he’ll be like “bad!” But he’ll say it like he’s talking to a dog. It’s very demeaning and very triggering. I know candy bars aren’t good for me but the point is balance. When I was heavy into my ED there was no balance and often times I would eat something like that and purge it. 

I’ve tried talking to him about this by telling him how it makes me feel but he dismisses me and says things like ‘I just need coffee’ or that I’m ‘acting like a teenager’ because I “rebelled” and didn’t put the candy bar down etc.

I'm pretty sure my best friend has an eating disorder, I can't really say what kind but all I know is that he thinks he's ""fat"" (he is definitely underweight and even if he was overweight, I'd fucking love him all the same) and that doesn't really eat. It's difficult because I don't struggle with these kinds of body issues so I'm not sure what the appropriate way to confront/address this or if I even SHOULD address it. Plus, I know with men it's more complex because society really loves to emphasize eating disorders as a ""woman's mental illness"" even though sex/gender have nothing to do with body dismorphia and disordered eating.

I want to be a good friend. I want to try and help him but I know he doesn't really want help, and you can't force people to put the effort in when it comes to mental health. That just makes things so much worse.

Im really sorry if this post dont belong here but i dont seriously know where else to ask this.

So i have been talking to someone random for few hours now. We first talked just how i have little bit anorextic thoughts and traits, and how im insecure about my body. Then he told how he likes bigger girls, and that was okay to me that he just told what he likes. But then he starts to say things like ""You should eat a lot so you would be *** pounds"". It feels like he is pressuring/manipulating me to eat a lot so i would be overweight. I just told him that its already hard to eat normal amount, but he still keeps saying things like that. But also he is saying that he could at least try to help me to get better.

I really need yall opinions on this. And if you want to see what we talked and what else he said to me you can come to chat with me so i can put screenshots to you, so that you can better express your opinion.

149,EatingDisorders,"I’ve been dealing with BED for more than half my life. I’ve ruined my body inside and out and that realization, along with my husband’s support, gave me the motivation to try to get better. 

However, after seeing the number on the scale dropping quickly and steadily, I started getting a high from losing weight. The more weight I lost, the less I would eat, and the less I would eat, the easier it was to not binge. I would challenge myself to meet unhealthy goals, and I almost always met them. 

I stopped “dieting” for a few weeks after having my gallbladder removed and spent some time moderating while still eating what I wanted. Then I had a day where I couldn’t stop eating. I had one of my worst binging episodes ever and ended up violently ill the following day. 

I thought that would be my rock bottom and not binging would be easy after that, but I find when I eat the way I should, it makes me want more, making it nearly impossible not to binge. When I eat little to nothing, binging isn’t an issue so I tend to opt for that. I know this isn’t healthy, but I can’t find a happy medium. I feel doomed to a life of eating disorders no matter what I do.

I told my psychiatrist that I feel like I’m trading a food addiction for a weight loss addiction and she didn’t have much to say about it.

I started mirtazapine a year ago and in my prescribing appointment the mental health nurse asked me about my eating habits, she was concerned when I talked about how much I was restricting so I downplayed and told her at the next appointment I wasn't. Lately it's getting worse. I came back to uni and had to do a food shop for myself and being in the supermarket around all the food overwhelmed me to the point of near panic attack and I struggle to eat more than once a day, and find it nearly impossible to eat in front of anyone these days.

I go to her for something else but she knows about my messed up relationship with food so every session we spend at least a small amount of time talking about it (she insisted on it so if she does care)to check up on me and make sure it doesn’t get completely out of hand.

During our last session she asked me how it was going and at some point I asked her if she thinks I have an Ed, and she responded that she thinks that it seems that it’s still a hobby to me and that I just like spending time being busy with body image and calorie tracking and that an eating disorder becomes a disorder once you physically can’t do things anymore like going to a school etc and also that I didn’t look that unhealthy anyways and damn it really messed me up 💀.

Before she said that the amount of cals I consumed a day was already like toddler sized but now even that seems too much for me and I just don’t want to eat anymore and start hating the feeling of food in my body. I already think I might have some type of b/p ana bc i am underweight now but I still binge and I already feel invalid and gross for binging but her comment straight up made it worse and now I just feel like I have to prove to her that I can get skinnier and that I can look unhealthy and part of my wants to tell her that her comment messed me up but at the same time i am just so uncomfortable talking about my struggles around food I just never want to talk about it with her again.

I usually have to takes meats or cheeses but they don't appeal. Food is boring and feels like work. I don't do breakfast so I often don't eat (or drink sometimes, because if I drink on an empty stomach I vomit) until I get home at 4. Food seems useless and if I don't like it I can't bring myself to eat it. Sometimes I'll even gag and have trouble swallowing despite there being no real issue with taste or texture.

166,EatingDisorders,"I have a therapist that I see regularly for dealing with PTSD and this morning I brought up having some issues with eating over the past three months. I’ve been ignoring it because I already have enough issues, but my doctor is concerned about my weight loss (currently at xx  lbs when I need to weigh yy lbs minimum ... a significant amount) and my clothes have started hanging off of me.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother and her husband (not my bio dad) always made comments about gaining weight even though I’ve always been thin and athletic. I think they were maybe projecting, idk. Lots of “once on the lips, twice on the hips”, “weight gain in your face is hard to lose and your face is round enough” (my face is not round at all), and other comments about my stomach having fat rolls (again, I have always been athletic, so these did not exist).

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not really sure why it would be manifesting now that I’m in my early 20s; their comments usually went in one ear and out the other but now I can’t help but think that I look overweight. Particularly in my face, stomach, and hips. I know that, logically and realistically, I do not have any excess weight but I still fixate on it. I’m not super obsessed with counting calories or anything like that, but I do go one or two days at a time without eating on a regular basis and when I do eat, it’s usually something small like a bowl of cereal. I’m just worried I’ll put on weight, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, not sure why it’s only now becoming an issue, but both my doctor and my therapist agree that I need to see someone about this. My therapist said this morning said that it sounds like I might have some body dysmorphia and an ED, but unfortunately that isn’t what she specializes in. She wants me to find an ED specialist and schedule an appointment with them by next Wednesday. And I’m also supposed to meet with my doctor about healthy meal plans and diets at some point.

i have an eating disorder but its not anorexia, bulimia, or anything where im trying to lose weight or be skinny. ive seen 4 psychiatrists, 2 ER doctors, and 3 therapists in the last 6 years and none of them have any answers for my symptoms. ok so sometimes i cant eat food because im stressed or im just not hungry, and then when i start to get hungry, i feel like the timings ""not right"" and i have to wait and try again. And im not doing this on purpose or to try and lose weight, i cant control when this happens. so then im finally able to eat, and i take one bite and im completely full. and for the people saying ""you have to force yourself to eat"" i literally cant because ive tried that many times and i usually throw up, not on purpose. sometimes food is just completely overwhelming and i literally just dont want it to touch my tongue. i dont have the mental energy to mash up food with my mouth or swallow it, everything sounds gross and makes me depressed. (it also doesnt help that i live in america and the fda approves carcinogens in our food) so for example, i couldnt eat for  days because the timing wasn't right (literal time of the day and other variables that include stress, feeling of stomach, how hot or cold the environment is and type of food + the texture of the food) and then today i decided i had to eat an entire pizza to make up for the calories i lost from not eating, and that gives me stomach aches which cause more anxiety. and now i wont eat until probably tomorrow night because i have work in the morning and it stresses me out so bad i cant eat there its so gross nobody wears their mask in the break room.

ive been having this same problem for about 5 years now and i am currently almost 21 and weigh about xx pounds (very low).

the only things that make it kind of bearable are mirtazapine and smoking weed.

i havent had any trauma regarding food in the past my parents have always had good eating habits and kept the fridge stocked with healthy foods and i was allowed to eat whenever i wanted when i was growing up.

but yea i really want to gain weight im sick of looking like a teenager, sometimes i get so much anxiety about it that jts hard to eat and its a horrible cycle i get stuck in

169,EatingDisorders," 

Hi Reddit. I’m 16, and a guy. I’ve been dealing with disordered eating and unhealthy thinking around my relationship with food since I was a preteen, and I think it’s affecting me largely enough to reach the point of an eating disorder of some kind.

I’m not going to detail too much as that’s not really what this post is about, but I restrict, I think as a result of both being unhappy with the way I look and feeling out of control of other things around me. I feel guilty about not eating healthily or exercising as much as I should, but in trying to do so I have always just ended up making myself feel worse and doing it for the wrong reasons. I used to develop a lot of weird stomach issues and with the handful of medications I’ve cycled through quite a few have really messed with my appetite, including my ADHD medication which of course I take daily. I’ve tried to deal with it on my own but as my general mental health has been improving a lot (which I am so grateful for), my habits and thoughts around eating have not and I think it might be time for me to get help.

I’ve mentioned my eating somewhat in passing to my mom and my former therapist, but neither seemed to understand fully what I was getting at. One of the first things I talked to my therapist about was how I felt I did not think of food in a healthy way but it was kind of just left there, and I mentioned to my mom when she began to notice my eating habits getting worse again during the very first lockdown here in Canada how I sometimes eat less if it means feeling in control of something. That was basically where the conversation ended. I don’t blame either of them because I have a hard time accurately describing things and minimizing them when I do, and I didn’t quite talk about the extent of these thoughts and behaviours.

I’m afraid to ask anybody for help and talking properly about how bad it’s gotten in the past and how it affects me day-to-day, even on good days, because I feel a strong sense of shame surrounding this aspect of my mental health. People generally think of EDs as a ‘girl thing’ which logically I know is absolutely not true and in theory I know that there’s no shame in the struggle that I’m having, but when I think about telling somebody and having them look at me and KNOW that this is something that’s on my mind all the time, I just feel so mortified. The thought of telling my mom makes me feel ill, and I have a very strong relationship with my mom and tell her everything, she’s been my main support through every other struggle I’ve had with my mental health and she’s supportive and understanding beyond what I would have ever hoped. But I just can’t stomach the idea of telling her more about this than I already have. I’m scared of telling anybody. The only person who really knows is my best friend, who also struggles with it. He’s the only one I’ve ever really talked about things in detail with, but of course he can only do so much and generally we steer away from talking about it with each other to avoid triggering the other or something.

Even typing this and sharing with people who will never know my name or anything about me other than this, I feel terrible. I don’t even really know why. I guess by admitting that something is wrong in more than my own head means it’s more real and I’m not ready for things to turn upside down to make me better somehow, and also maybe I just don’t want things to not be okay. I don’t know. But I’m really not sure what to do. I don’t want to feel like this all the time and trying to fix it on my own hasn’t worked but I also don’t want to talk to people and have them see me the way I see myself, as weak or something. I don’t know. I’m also scared of what treatment might look like for me. The idea of meal plans or being monitored in any way or anything just makes me feel sick and the idea of eyes on my eating habits more than they already might be makes me feel so anxious. I feel like I’m not ready to get help yet but I’ve also been telling myself that for years and I really want to feel better and be able to eat without feeling guilty. Sorry for the long post, I just really don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go or who to talk to, I considered talking to a teacher I trust but again I’m scared of how they might see me and I’m scared of burdening them with my issues or making them worry or something.

Thank you in advance for any and all help. I don’t entirely know what I’m looking for, because I don’t know if I will end up getting help any time soon.

Basically, I hate food and everything about it. I hate chewing, I hate the smells, I hate the textures, it all makes me nauseous. My body gets hungry, really hungry, but the thought of eating is absolutely repulsive. My stomach can be growling but still, the thought of eating is so unpleasant. The only “food” I can really think about eating without getting nauseous is like Naked Juices and soup, but let’s be honest, it’s unrealistic to switch to “drinking meals” for the rest of my life so I’d like to relearn how to want to eat food. I haven’t always been like this, maybe the past 2 years or so. I remember I used to not mind chewing, I used to crave food. It’s starting to become a real issue because it takes me forever to get anything done because my life revolves around forcing myself to eat. I don’t not eat, I pretty much snack instead of eat meals because I can’t sit down and enjoy a meal. I can “handle” snacks because it’s only a couple bites I have to force down. When I force myself to eat (everyday) it’s so unpleasant. It sucks to force yourself to eat but I do it because I know I need to eat, I know I can’t skip meals and be healthy. I’m happy with my body and I force myself to eat because I like to stay active and you can’t really be active if you don’t eat.

I’m a teen in high school and around 3-4 years ago I ran into some issues with my weight. I thought that skipping meals would make people like me more since in middle school I was made fun of but not necessarily for my weight ever. I was very awkward and what most people would consider unattractive. So I began to drop weight like crazy and eventually my friends said they’d tell someone. Fast forward a year and I started to get into makeup, it started out very natural and light but it turned into a full face for school every single day. The guys and girls that made fun of me now paid extra attention to me. I was called beautiful by everyone even some of my siblings guy friends and soccer teammates. Problem is that I look disgusting without it and I have to wake up early every morning to put on this mask. And even after years my weight problem has never gone away, I throw out lunch at school to stay under a weight and I refuse breakfast. I get extreme guilt and panic when I go over a set number of cals. I cant tell my mom or an adult because my own mom even said I’m wearing too much makeup and asked what I’d do if these boys saw me without it. And when I tried opening up to her about my diet problem when it first started my phone was taken and that was that.

Hello all, I am a 20 year old with BPD and have restricted for three-ish years. In the first year, I lost \_\_ lbs in 7 months. Then, I kept up the restricting to maintain it and gradually lose even more weight.

A year ago in December, I had wisdom teeth surgery and was on a round of antibiotics. That’s when my GI issues started. I experienced reflux, ibs, bloating, chest pains, nausea, LPR (reflux which affects the vocal chords and upper body/nasal passages), and about a million other symptoms. Stomach pain, burning, belching, indigestion, you name it. We did a million tests. Put me on a million meds. Nothing worked, and my reflux score was through the roof. No SIBO, no H. Pylori, no ulcers, nothing. Except for a small hiatal hernia, that is. I qualified for surgery, and am supposed to get it in a month. However, about 6 months into this whole ordeal, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis, and just so happened to start recovery and gaining weight at this time. See the connection?

The GP was initially bad, and while I never threw up, I had bear constant nausea and stomach pains. Then, I followed a low fat, low fiber diet. Up until this point I had literally been limiting myself to one meal of bland chicken and rice a day, believing it to be healing as that’s what all the acid reflux groups told me to do (look up the Acid Watchers Diet- absolute anorexia fuel).

Eventually, my dad realized that I was using this diet as a way to fuel my ED.I was tired and in pain and sick of not eating what I wanted. The kicker was that the diet wasn’t even helping. So now I was miserable AND refluxing daily. So I said fuck it. I may as well eat what I want and deal with the consequences. So I did just that- I ate what I wanted. Chocolate, coffee, pizza, all the bad GERD foods. And it was bad for a bit, but then… it got better. And it just kept getting better the more my restrictions lifted. Every day I tried a new food that I hadn’t touched in years, whether it be due to the ED or low acid diet. And every day, I felt a little better. Now, I have gained \_\_ lbs and eat whatever I want. And I still have occasional nausea and sadly nightly reflux every night (my LES is shit, when I lay down it all comes up no matter what), but Jesus fucking Christ I feel so FREE and GOOD for the first time in forever. That’s great right?

Now my fear: I’m supposed to get a Nissen Fundiplication surgery and hiatal hernia repair in November. It’s supposed to get rid of my reflux for good. The drawbacks, however, are as follows; 3 months of a restricted liquid recovery diet, the inability to ever burp/vomit again, will be restricted against certain foods forever, a high chance that it will CAUSE GASTROPARESIS, a high fail rate after 5 years, and the inability to ever lift more than 50 lbs again.

Look, I know horror stories are everywhere and that I should just ignore them, but I can’t. I’m just stumped, I planned my life around the idea of getting this surgery in November. I postponed school for it. But my dad is terrified that it’s a big mistake, and that restricting will only make things worse again. He says that if I need to get the surgery later in life, to do it, but if my GI issues are manageable now and only getting better to not risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

I, myself haven't personally suffered any form of eating disorder so I find it really hard to understand how it impacts someone and their emotions and sense of self - so I'm desperately seeking help.

&amp;#x200B;

I met my partner during a time when she had relapsed and was very thin, the usual visible bones and really hollow face

&amp;#x200B;

Since being together I've been really trying to help her with her recovery and encourage her, cook her meals that actually taste amazing so she can find some joy in eating. This has all worked great and she's slowly put weight back on.

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm worried because she keep referring to herself as gross and fat etc - when really she just looks like an average human now.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some things I can do or say to reassure her that she looks perfectly fine and normal? Are there anything I should avoid saying or do? Are there any behaviours I shouldn't play into?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would massively be appreciated!

This has been an issue for most of my life where I have zero portion control and put a lot more on my plate than I should and still feel hungry afterwards. I’d ask my stepmom if would be okay for me to eat something a few hours after eating dinner and usually she’d say no. My parents would have to make some of my food for me because I didn’t know when too much was too much. My stepmother also made a rule one day where I had to wait for someone to be in the kitchen in order to eat or be anywhere near the kitchen, but this rule never happened.

Me and my parents have argued many times about portion control and Ive gotten grounded before because of it. It’s gotten so bad that I’d steal snacks from other people (my stepmoms room as an example). An example being that one night I was still hungry after eating dinner so I grabbed a donut and took it up to my room, which I didnt think anything of at the time. But now I realize that that was a dumb decision because 1. The donuts are only for breakfast and 2. I took one when I didn’t even know if anyone else had any yet. My stepmom immediately knew that I had took them and this was the conversation:

Stepmom: I know you think you are slick coming down here and taking donuts while I’m in the bathroom! You are ridiculous! You felt the need to take the rest of what was in that box but one half!? You might as well have taken that one too! You don’t listen to anyone! You know you aren’t supposed to be doing that shit!

Me: I took one and I thought that one half was for someone else cause it was only one half.

Stepmom: You had more than one tonight. I don’t care that you want to have more than one donut, but you should have waited until tomorrow.

Stepmom: That’s too much in one night, you have to start having some self control. I hate that I have to hide everything because you can’t control yourself. Everything in moderation girl.

Stepmom: I love you and don’t want to see you have health issues like me. That’s why I get on you.

I don’t really know why I do this. I believe I do it because I’m bored and that food is the only thing that’s really enjoyable to me anymore. I’ve also had an unhealthy diet as a child so that probably makes it worse. But I know that I need to stop doing this, especially considering I’m overweight and barely do any exercise cause I’m afraid of people judging me.

For six+ months I’ve been doing so much better. Today, a friend of mine told me I look like someone (tiktok) famous, who just so happens to be plus size (makeup videos, their body is never even in shot). They’re a beautiful person, and their makeup is amazing, and all of the comments are telling her how beautiful she is, and she is beautiful. But how come after six + months of doing ok, it broke me? I haven’t felt this triggered in so long. I had my first meal at 2pm today after work (unplanned, but something me a year ago would’ve been proud of) and after receiving her message saying I looked like her, I suddenly felt disgustingly guilty about eating as I was about to take my last few bites. I didn’t take them, and now I’m scared about how long this fog will last.

I’ve never been that triggered about anything before during my improvement with food until now. It feels so scary, it feels like I want to hide and not eat and not wear anything nice or do my makeup or see anyone at all. It makes me think about what I was like a year ago, and my brain starts whispering that it’s a good idea, I deserve to go back there, it’s what I need. I know it’s not right, I know my brain is horrible for thinking these things not just about myself, but for it thinking the person I apparently look like is a negative way to look.

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost a year now. We met the first month of college and have been dating ever since. Throughout the course of the school year she developed body image issues and started restricting food always looking up calorie counts and was so intent on losing weight. It got to a very dangerous point but she mustered up the will to put herself into treatment this past summer. She really wanted to come to school this year and has a meal plan etc. Everything seemed to be going good but recently she’s started to push me away. She says it’s because it makes her feel bad when if don’t eat as much as her or eat at the same time. I try my best to make her feel as safe as possible but I don’t know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now being followed by a nutritionist who gave me a weekly meal plan to follow: I went from eating very very little, tirelessly exercising, to following a balanced and satisfying meal plan, not really exercising besides some light walking (I was advised not to exercise heavily because we're trying to get my period back). My main problem right now, though, is: snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I used not to have them before (not for lack of hunger, of course) but my nutritionist added them to the plan, and while the first few days went somewhat good (my body was a bit confused because my hunger signals are completely fucked up right now, and I didn't know whether I was hungry or not, whether I wanted more food or not, etc.), the past few ones have been odd.

&amp;#x200B;

After I eat my snack, I get this incredible energy crash where I feel completely low, irritable, sleepy and am unsure whether I am getting 'about to faint' signals from my body. It doesnt really happen after my meals though, so it must be something tied to the snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how normal this is, I mean I'm thinking it might have something to do with my metabolism suddenly getting all this energy that it was lacking before, and using it all up, but I don't know. My weight (in the low-healthy range) has been somewhat stable for now, it's a little bit less than what it was when I was last visited by my nutritionist, but less than half a lb. I'm trying to follow my meal plan as best as I can, although it's not always easy as you all know.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone experienced something similar in recovery? I will of course speak to my nutritionist about it, but I first wanted to know whether it was a scary scary issue or somewhat normal o.O

182,EatingDisorders,"A bit of background, I’ve struggled with a restrictive ED for about ten years now; things have been up and down but things were actually going pretty well for me up until recently. I had to attend an occupational health meeting for my new job a few months ago (I am a doctor myself) just to go through my medical history and my ED was brought up. I definitely got the impression that the doctor seeing me had a slight judgmental tone (if not a bit disapproving); although I’m used to it, as I’ve had bad experiences as a patient when doctors/health professionals find out I’m a doctor struggling with ED. She then asked about all my ED behaviours in detail, which I felt extremely uncomfortable talking about as she was a complete stranger and even with therapists it takes some time to open up. She weighed me as well, which I suffer a lot of anxiety from and have not done so in a long time. After all that, she kind of ‘lectured’ (?) me about how I need to maintain a ‘healthy’ weight and if I lost too much weight then they would have to remove me from my job and I couldn’t return to work until I’d recovered my weight, plus another few months on top of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I get where she was coming from. But ever since that meeting (I was cleared for work which was fine, there weren’t any concerns) I’ve felt it really triggered a lot of past behaviours and anxiety.

Hello, I think today I’ve reached my breaking point/ break through of realizing where I am at and it’s been sudden and I am very confused. I want to schedule a check up with a doctor in the next week and be proactive, but I’m just so confused at the same time of how I got here.

I didn’t ever have a problem with my weight and I’ve never hated it, barely thought about it, but things happened so fast and it feels like I hadn’t even realized it. So that’s kinda why I’m confused if I have an ED.

I have been around an average weight most of my life. 2-3 years ago I was slightly overweight due to a medical condition which I gained that weight in 3 months, then lost the same amount of weight in three months due to medication (doctors told me it was water weight/ inflation from the medication). But even then, I never really put much thought into my weight or appearance.

After that year, I’ve maintained my average healthy weight until very recently and I don’t know why but it went unnoticed. The last time I weighed myself four months ago, I was exactly my healthy weight. Since the pandemic started I’ve just been wearing sweats, hoodies, not putting much effort because I just wanted to be comfortable because I am staying home. My family and friends I see on a daily had not made any comments on my appearance either, I’m guessing since they see me everyday, they don’t notice subtle changes.

But it was yesterday that I met up with friends I hadn’t seen in a year. And the first thing, and the only thing they brought up was “you lost so much weight, your cheekbones are so prominent, you look like a model with that jawline” and questions along those lines.

And that is when I became self conscious, confused, all of the emotions basically. I didn’t have a problem with being an average weight for my height. And now it’s just making me reflect on my body more. My diet has remained the same, in fact I am eating more than I had before, I am exercising way less too. So I’m just in a confused state.

Today, I finally weighed myself. I am very underweight. I haven’t been this weight since I was in elementary school ten years ago. I took my hoodie and sweats off and looked at myself in the mirror. I put my hands around my waist and my fingertips are a few inches from touching each other. I broke down.

I want to be proactive health wise because I know this weight can be dangerous so I am scheduling an appointment because I haven’t changed any sleep, food, or exercise habits, and my mood was happier than ever so I do have underlying health concerns.

But I am here on this subreddit because psychologically, I am just confused, panicked, I don’t know what to do because I don’t know how I got here in such little time. Is this an ED, do I have BD? I know I need to get medical help but will they also provide me with therapeutic help? Has anyone else ever been through this? I don’t know, I have so many questions and no one to really talk about it at the moment because the people I see everyday haven’t noticed change, and the people I haven’t seen in a year, are trying to romanticize it even though I think it’s not good.",,Request: I’ve reached my breaking point,2,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pwq4rm,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pwq4rm/request_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pwq4rm/request_ive_reached_my_breaking_point/,1632775425,595,0,0,0,-1,1,Sudden weight loss and change in appearance,neutral,"Feeling confused, panicked, and unsure about how they got to where they are, Concerns about underlying health issues and potential need for medical and therapeutic help","Sudden change in weight and appearance, comments from friends romanticizing weight loss",harmful,"Confusion and panic about how the writer got to this point, Becoming self-conscious and reflecting on body more, Realization of being underweight and potential health concerns","Sudden and significant weight loss, comments from friends romanticizing weight loss",harmful,"Individual is experiencing confusion, panic, and self-consciousness about their body, Individual is unsure if they have an eating disorder or body dysmorphia"

Last year I tried again, when I was experiencing some bad body issues, and I would just cry every time I exercised because my intention was to make my body look ""better"". Whenever I lose a bit of weight I get very self conscious, because I feel I look as ""bad"" as I did when I had an ED, even though you can barely see a difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm satisfied with my body and weight now, I don't really look at my body and I rarely check my weight which is good progress for me. I would like to be a bit stronger and feel healthier. I have some form of heart condition (waiting for a diagnosis). I'm not particularly fit and I get tired very easily as well. I know exercise won't fix my heart condition but I think it would help me to feel better physically.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how can I exercise without obsessively thinking about how it's going to change how my body looks, or how my weight may change?",,Request: Exercising after recovering from anorexia,25,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pv4cdg,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pv4cdg/request_exercising_after_recovering_from_anorexia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pv4cdg/request_exercising_after_recovering_from_anorexia/,1632566353,249,0,0,0,-1,1,Struggling with body image and past history of anorexia; wanting to exercise for physical health benefits but not wanting to obsess over body changes,neutral,"Crying during exercise due to negative body image thoughts, Fear of losing weight and becoming self-conscious again, Desire to exercise for physical health benefits and to feel stronger",Trying to exercise without obsessively thinking about body image and weight,unknown,"Writer is in recovery from anorexia and has had negative experiences with exercising in the past, including counting calories and losing weight.

185,EatingDisorders,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I am in ED recovery, used to suffer from binging and purging. I have learned about how my body expresses its needs to me and how to recognize true versus fake hunger (true hunger being the physical feeling of hunger; fake hunger being a craving for a specific food, for example chocolate, unaccompanied by an actual feeling of physical hunger). I was wondering how people deal with this fake hunger, since I recognize that succumbing to it will not satisfy the fake hunger and will make me physically uncomfortable since I will be way too full. What are some ways people find helpful in dealing with these thoughts?

She wasn't coughing earlier today, and I'm concerned that what I actually heard was her forcing herself to vomit. It is also possible that she was just coughing a lot and also had to go to the bathroom, it happens sometimes. Maybe she drank some water wrong, idk.

First time poster here. I would love some advice on how to deal with competitive jealously/envy that forms from someone else with an ED.

So the situation - cannot stop obsessing/ having intrusive thoughts over running into a former friend from treatment who has lost a lot of weight. We have not been in contact for quite awhile (our friendship was toxic &amp; we both knew that) but the competitive feelings are still so strong.

So, between the ages of 15-19ish I struggled with an undiagnosed restrictive eating disorder. As far as physical symptoms go, it never got that severe, but it was extremely mentally taxing, as it consumed a majority of my daily thoughts. Eventually, the obsession with it subsided as I got more determined to recover for the sake of my future family.

Fast forward to several years later, and I'm living off of my savings in college, besides a small income from a part-time minimum wage job. I had all these plans for what I wanted to cook and eat for myself in college so I could eat healthier (meaning, actually eating fruits and veggies on a daily basis and skipping the ramen). But sticker shock quickly set in; combine that with anxiety about my financial future, laziness from depression and schoolwork, and I've headed the opposite direction. I find myself avoiding buying food under any circumstance. I avoid going to the grocery store, I avoid going out to eat, I feel good every time I skip a meal because I think of the money I'm saving.

However, I haven't started eating more, despite having less reason not to. My parents are kind enough that they're now giving me $20 a week for food. I find myself feeling unreasonably guilty about eating my boyfriend's food. And besides, I'm rarely in the mood to eat, especially if I'm really hungry. Occasionally, I just feel a general fear of eating food.

But it's not like I'm afraid of getting fat, like before. I rather wish I were more muscular and curvier. Although I will admit that, deep down, very specific things like seeing a bigger number on a scale, or pants feeling tighter trigger me.

Is this an eating disorder? If you have any coping strategies or directions I can pursue out of this, that would be great.

Hey everyone, I tried to find something on this but I couldn’t find any so I’m sorry if this has been asked before.

I (m18) struggle to eat, I’m not sure if it counts as an eating disorder but I do count calories and sometimes skip meals. My friend (m18) has just told me that he is also struggling with eating, from what he has told me it is very similar to mine. So I have a few questions:

Q: I know that there are many different forms of ED and not everyone fits a label, but does what I described count as an Ed?

Q: Should I tell him about me as well? No one knows about my issues with eating, I have just been dealing with it on my own, I’m worried that if I tell him about mine it will be too much for him.

Q: How do I help him out? I have been there as much as I can for him but I don’t know what to say or do as to not trigger him, I’m just really worried about him.

Hello,

Recently I haven't been eating all that much. I've definitely lost weight, and although that is a good thing as I am overweight, I don't think its happening in a healthy way. You see, I recently started my second year at college. Last year I had similar eating issues, as I had found going to the cafeteria to be exhausting and a drag on my day, so eventually I kinda just stopped going unless I absolutely had to eat something. This year its kind of the same, except I'm eating even less and I've developed this anxiety, almost like a sense of dread, that comes on when I think about having a full meal. Even when I do challenge that anxiety and go to the caf to get some food (since I know I need to eat), I find it difficult to actually get a solid amount of food down. Every single time there's always something left on my plate, and although I want to eat it, I simply can't. Today, I couldn't even finish one piece of lasagna. It tasted fine, but getting it down made me feel like I was going to throw up.

I feel like this lack of eating is leading to brain fog and a general feeling of low energy, and I don't know what to do about it. I want to eat more, but my body isn't agreeing. I also have this weird feeling in my stomach that happens when I'm hungry but it feels so odd that if anything it makes me not want to put anything in my stomach over fear I might chuck it all up. I don't really know what to do anymore and I'm starting to get really worried about this. Its stressing me out a lot. Has anyone else here had symptoms like this? Do you know what to do about it?

Also as a sidenote I am bipolar type two and have been in therapy for many years, am on medication to control mania and depression aswell as insomnia, and I smoke weed daily, usually to relax and go to sleep.

Hi,

 My mother has struggled with disorder eating for as long as I can remember. As for myself, I have been struggling with maintaining a healthy weight due to anxiety and OCD for the past 2 years.

I have been noticing she stares at my body when I talk to her lately. It makes me very uncomfortable. To the point that I deliberately cover up in really baggy clothes if I’m going to be interacting with her. I’ve brought it up with her, but she denies she does it. However, the last time I said something along the lines of “please stop looking at my body” she said that I had a “beautiful body”.

For parents who struggle with disordered eating, is this something that’s normal?

I’m trying to be supportive during her recovery and be there for her, but it really makes me uncomfortable and makes me not want to see her in person.

BF says he’s stopped purging but his self hatred and body dysmorphia is still so bad. And it’s honestly ruining my self esteem because I’ve slightly curvy and he’s almost skin and bones and talks about his stomach and thigh gap and it’s getting in my head. He tells me I’m perfect but still I’ve started monitoring my weight and started a diet because the things he says he hates about himself are on my body not his.

Additionally his self hatred making complimenting him or telling him I love him impossible. He will respond “how could you love this fat piece of shit?” So ive started saying it less. I’ve told him I don’t like when he does this because it comes off like he’s trying to convince me I shouldnt find him attractive and him trying to convince me I shouldn’t love him. And he ignores it and doesn’t even consider it

I’ve talked to him about talking to someone before and he refuses and said “therapists are for people who insane” and he didn’t like me saying he needed to see a shrink.

But now that I can’t say I love you to him and I’m starting to have a worse self esteem I need him to get help. So how do I say “get help or our relationship will end if you don’t” without that ultimatum because honestly it’s hurting me so much to hear him talk about himself like that and it’s hurting me to watch him still monitor his weight and skip meals and he says he’s better because he says he not purging anymore but he still thinks he needs to lose another 15 lbs but I’ve told him if he does he will have to get medical help he will be too skinny",,Request: BFs self hatred is ruining our relationship,13,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,prrqnu,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/prrqnu/request_bfs_self_hatred_is_ruining_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/prrqnu/request_bfs_self_hatred_is_ruining_our/,1632132265,301,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,,,,,,

198,EatingDisorders,"For starters, I was diagnosed with ADHD and GAD. I don't know if that info will be of benefit in knowing but my confusion around eating hasn't really been in the forefront of my mind. Until the other day. I had a breakdown because the store didn't have my white castle cheeseburgers. Looking back now, my appetite is and always has been weird/wanky. The white castle burgers is what I've been eating for the last couple of months, nearly everyday w/ my cup of cereal for lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I do this with different foods all the time. I eat a specific food until I absolutely can't anymore. When the food that I am hungry for is not available, I break down. I can't just get in the pantry and easily grab/make something else. My brain simply doesn't work that way for.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: It may seem weird but I really don't consider myself to be a picky eater per se on what foods I actually like. I love just about every veggie out there and every meat source. I don't eat raw foods i.e. sushi. Besides that my variety seems endless.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this last food ""episode"" made me conscious that this is Not the first time I had a breakdown over food like this. The amount of mental work it takes to figure out what my body will accept to eat is quite concerning. I try so hard to work my appetite up, and sometimes to no avail.

&amp;#x200B;

More often than not, thinking of certain foods make me feel gaggy and nauseous and I'd rather not eat at all. I push something down anyway in those instances because I know my body needs nourishment.

&amp;#x200B;

I do struggle w/ self esteem issues and C-PTSD but not really anything to do with my weight though. When I eat THC, I could eat anything under the sun. It ramps up my appetite and sometimes a little too much blood sugar wise (I'm also diabetic and have other health issues than what's been previously listed above) I don't want to depend on getting it in order to be able to eat. It's pricey and I can't really afford it nor want to be high all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: I don't and never have binged/purged. I have No want to. I'm not on a specific hardcore diet. I don't do calorie deficits or any type of fasting trends. I rarely ever drink a diet soda/caffeine. I don't eat out often. Stick to water or milk. I don't have an unhealthy relationship w/ candy-sweets.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just looking for support and if anyone has a similar experience with this whole eating sitch.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps it has something to do w/ ADHD or perhaps it's own entity?

200,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone, I didn't know where to write or even if i should meddle in this. Anyway, here it goes:

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend has a cousin who came to study in the same city as us last year. He comes to visit very often and is currently staying with us for some weeks. My boyfriends family always referred to him as thin, but he is severely underweight and sickly looking. I mean i was taken aback the first time i saw him, i thought he might have some kind of health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway i started suspecting he might have an ED when i noticed how much he would say he is eating. Like in any random conversation with him he would say that a day before he ate this and that (lists about xxx kcal worth of food - a large amount). Without me asking or without the topic being about food. Are random lies about food consumption a symptom of an ED?

&amp;#x200B;

Every time he comes to visit he is always about to faint and is physically very weak (as in he struggles to hold even his bags). When i ask him if he has eaten anything and to make dinner, he will reply that on that specific day he was very busy and then will proceed to mention how much he had eaten the other days.

&amp;#x200B;

And now since he is staying with us i noticed that when we sit down to eat he will have at least one glass of water before eating, 2-3 during food and one after. And then he goes to the bathroom afterwards. I might be imagining things, but i thought he might be throwing up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if i should even bring this up, it's probably none of my business, should i say anything to him or even what i should say. I have no clue how to approach this. Even if he doesn't have an ED, being as skinny as he is and not eating until the point a person feels nauseous isn't healthy.

201,EatingDisorders,"I dealt with bulimia and anorexia for eight years and ultimately recovered two years ago (I’ve been doing great except for the occasional triggers). A year and a half ago, I decided to cut out fast food from my diet just to be healthier, which has been amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of the blue, about a year ago, my weight started fluctuating more than usual. I figured it was maybe due to cutting out the fast food and didn’t pay it much mind until 6 months ago when it was dropping pretty rapidly. At this time, I was trying to put on muscle, so this was frustrating for me. For my entire life, I’ve never really eaten much (I look back on my childhood and see a lot of disordered eating habits that I never noticed that fueled my ED later in life), but at the time I was trying to put on muscle, I was eating normal, regularly scheduled meals.

&amp;#x200B;

I saw my doctor and got blood work done which came back perfect. I genuinely thought I was going to see thyroid issues or SOMETHING.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for the last few months I’ve been having trouble eating. Barely anything interests me or makes me hungry and I feel sick whenever I eat or look at food. I’m going to go back in to my doctor, but this has made me wonder if it has anything to do with recovering from an eating disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had history of having a funny relationship with food and I feel it's all catching up with me now.

&amp;#x200B;

As a child I used to eat a lot of food and never gain the weight from it, on my dads side they'd tease me for how much I ate and would offer me more food when I'd finish and sort of... let other families know I was a big eater. On my mums side my mum would worry I would get diabetes and my sisters would call me fat for what I'd eat even though I wasn't physically, even my friends at school would give me names such as ""fatass"" because of how I'd eat! as i got older my appetite died down a lot, to the point I could only manage 1 meal a day but there wasn't really any extra thought to it, I just couldn't manage to eat more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

However people started to notice I was losing weight and I started to notice too, my mum asked if I was starving myself and at that time I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

The sudden weight loss was a worry at first, I thought it was a sign of cancer or something? but after receiving a lot of compliments on my figure and how slim I was I started to enjoy it and kept up with measuring and weighing myself.

&amp;#x200B;

It came to a point where I was almost underweight, I become almost obsessive over how I looked and how much I weighed and I still am, however through covid things seemed to decline and I started using food as a sort of... punishment? I wouldn't eat all day if I hadn't done something ""worthy"" of it, now what makes me question if this is an eating disorder or not is because I'd also restrict myself on when I could go to the toilet, if I was ""worthy"" enough to go.

&amp;#x200B;

But as time goes on I'm still obsessed with how I look and my weight, I'm about to buy scales and I've made a goal for myself to actually hit that underweight mark, I almost brag to people that I'm almost there? I know it's not great and I'm the only one proud of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel guilt when I do eat heavy things like an actual meal, I can't even remember my last proper meal? I have a tenancy to binge on junk foods and sugary snacks at nighttime too when everyone is asleep, I still feel guilty and hate myself for it in the morning. But there are times where I can eat fine through the day and not feel guilty, times where I go out my way to eat? but I always come back to the restrictive eating.

&amp;#x200B;

Today just for example all I ate was a few yogurts and I felt really proud of myself for it, I felt hunger pains and felt accomplished by it?

&amp;#x200B;

To summarise, I've made a goal to become underweight, I feel immense guilt when I eat but sometimes I'm okay with eating, I use food as a threat to myself (if I feel like a failure I will starve myself), I binge at night when no one can see me eating junk.

this gets to my point. am i just lazy or is this the beginning of an eating disorder? i hate cooking but i dont hate eating. if someone bought me mcdonald’s when i got home id rightfully eat it up, or if my mom cooked me dinner i would eat that. but i never have enough motivation or energy to cook or really do anything. i spend 7 hours of my day on no food everyday. i feel myself being hungry and i know that’s not healthy but i really have no energy to cook.",,Request: Do I have an eating disorder or am I just lazy?,4,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,ppqj1m,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ppqj1m/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_am_i_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/ppqj1m/request_do_i_have_an_eating_disorder_or_am_i_just/,1631842081,209,0,0,0,-1,1,Lack of energy and motivation to cook leading to skipping meals and not eating enough,unknown,"Skipping meals and eating very little throughout the day, Feeling hungry but lacking the energy to cook or prepare food",Lack of appetite and energy due to caring for sick mother,unknown,"Eating very little throughout the day, relying on small snacks or one meal, Lack of motivation and energy to cook or eat, Feeling hungry but unable to address it due to lack of energy","Changes in daily routine due to mother being sick, lack of appetite and energy to cook",,"Eating small snacks or skipping meals, Feeling hungry but lacking motivation and energy to cook, Concerned about the possibility of developing an eating disorder"

209,EatingDisorders," 

First of all, I want to apologize if I unintentionally trivialize anyone’s experience or display any ignorance/insensitivity for eating disorders or someone’s specific circumstances. A firm trigger warning for starvation, major weight loss and weight gain, medication abuse, and a pretty in-depth description of what’s going on in my mind.

This is the first time I’m ever talking about any of this, like, ever, since I bury it in a deep and shameful part of my conscience, so I apologize if this is a bit of a vent. When I was in middle school (I am now a uni student), I was overweight. It wasn’t significant and I never had a problem with it — in fact, I never even noticed it. However, I was living with my very abusive mother who essentially bribed me to lose weight (I won’t get into specifics but by ‘lose weight’ I don’t mean a healthy amount). With a combination of her encouragement and mental abuse, I lost… a lot of weight really fast. I went from being a bit overweight to quite underweight. This was mostly all from just not eating. I honestly don’t remember it — it’s a blur, but even though I was never weight-conscious before this, I felt quite good afterwards. I never thought anything of it despite a few concerned comments from those who knew me.

I maintained my middle school weight for a while, occasionally gaining some and losing some, but generally staying in the same range. Over a year ago, shortly after the initial quarantine, I gained all of that weight back and then some without even really noticing. But there was one day I suddenly became aware of the feeling of my thighs rubbing against each other… and this completely set me off. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It has consumed me.

Now I am obsessed with weight. It is always on my mind no matter what I’m doing. I can’t stop comparing myself to everyone — I’ll compare myself to any random person on the street without being able to control my thoughts. I compare myself to my boyfriend and he’s significantly taller than me and a male, but I still do it. I can’t stop looking at photos of other people and old photos of myself. I can’t wear more than half of my clothes because they don’t fit in a very particular way. I don’t seem to have the restraint I did in middle school regarding food and I’ve been stuck in a miserable cycle of eating, despising myself for it and promising to stop, then caving in and eating again. I can’t stop obsessing over how appalling I feel in my own body and it’s made me extremely, extremely depressed and has become my number one preoccupation. This past year and a half has sent me into a downward spiral and after not losing weight due to my constant relapsing, I’ve started to abuse my ADHD medication.

I guess my question, as pathetic as it seems, is: could this be an eating disorder or am I just insecure?

For context, I am 19F living with my mum, with 2 older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. My mum does the grocery shopping, although me and my older sisters do pay some rent, and the four of us take turns making dinner.

On a couple of nights in a row, I found myself not particularly hungry during dinner and about halfway into my food I would feel full and slightly sick. I was sad because these were meals that I really enjoyed and made me feel really guilty about wasting my food. I started to avoid eating during the day so that I would be hungry for dinner and not waste the meal someone made for me.

At the same time, I also started feeling very depressed due to COVID lockdowns in my area and found a lot of my favourite snacks didn't taste good anymore so I eat a lot less than I did a couple of months ago. I never really eating a proper breakfast or lunch either but that is more about laziness over not wanting to prepare something for myself.

Do I have a problem? I always assumed that eating disorders were rooted more in body image or self-esteem so I don't know if what I'm experiencing should warrant concern.

But I find I have a lot of shame over food. I still eat snacks around my boyfriend often, but I find when I am alone I eat way more snacks.

It’s to the point where sometimes I’ll eat way more than I’m hungry for when I’m alone, not to the point of stuffing myself but it’s definitely just eating for no reason. I guess I find some sort of comfort in eating?

Another weird example is I always think to order junk food a lot of nights when my bf isn’t home (like a cinnamon bun) but rarely do because I feel guilty about eating unhealthy and also ashamed because I don’t want anyone to know I did that so I don’t want there to be garbage. It’s so stupid because I know my bf doesn’t care, and I know a treat is fine sometimes. But suggesting me order them together makes me feel bad too.

I'll start by repeating that I cannot afford to see a doctor until I  have insurance (10/26). I am currently supporting myself and my fiancee  (disabled, absolutely cannot work) on $15/hr working full time at a  well-known big box store.

MtF transgender (technically fluid but further info here is  irrelevant), 4.5 consecutive years on HRT. weight fluctuates all over  the place, up or down around a third of my body weight in a matter of 3  months feels almost normal to me, lately. For the last month or slightly  longer, I've had an issue that has progressively worsened. I seem to be  unable to eat anything and keep the entire meal down. Maybe the first  two or three bites are fine, but even a sandwich is too much for me most  of the time. I don't feel particularly stressed, but I do feel like I'm  kind of fat, despite being largely a healthy weight for my frame, and  only looking overweight in my belly area. The thought of stepping on a  scale and seeing that I have lost weight, even a half pound, makes me  feel elated. I tell people I am fat when they mention food or clothing,  and they look at me like ""girl you crazy."" wanna weigh a number that I  know isn't a healthy number for myself.

I'm frankly, afraid to put food in myself and force it down only for  it to come up about 45 minutes later. I'd like to check into a rehab  clinic but I don't have the money nor the credit to do so, and I'll have  insurance in \~45 days. can't decide if I need to check in sooner or not.

Does it count as an eating disorder if I eat quite a  lot during my normal periods and then undereat when I have anxiety,  possibly depression (or just sadness, hopelesness)?

I willingly lost quite a lot of weight last summer-autumn and went  from higher overweight to lower healthy, but since then i've been  maintaining my weight in a quite unusual (or maybe common idk) way,  which I don't do on purpose. I overeat when i am feeling  relaxed/happy/usual, and then I undereat when i am stressed. I may even  skip several meals when I am especially anxious or just depressed. I do  have body image issues but almost never is my stress caused by me  wanting to lose or control my weight. Before losing weight, i often  dealt with my stress and emptiness by overeating, which is why i  probably was overweight.

I'd tell myself  I wouldn't eat, or I'd only eat one meal a day, but it never became a  consistent thing. There was a period of time a few months ago where I  was broke, I couldn't afford any food, so I stopped eating often. I'd go  a day or two at a time without eating, because I had to make what I had  last. During that time I lost a lot of weight, and people noticed.  Things have gotten better, and I have a wonderful boyfriend who cooks me  delicious dinners that I will eat, but most days that's it. I won't eat  anything else except for maybe a granola bar.

I have read a lot about EDs trying to see what is  happening to me and I would come to a conclusion that in the past 3  years I suffered from bulimia, orthorexia, body dysmorphia, anorexia and  overeating. The main reason I developed it is because I started with a  strict gym regime where I lost a lot of weight. I tried to stay on that  weight (which now looking back was too low) and that’s where the problem  was. Also, my perception of food was (and still is) totally distorted.  It was then when I started purging the meals that I didn’t perceive as  “clean”. Later that developed into a full blown overeating and purging  period and I gained all the lost weight back plus more. I felt miserable  with myself for years. 

Recently, I lost the weight again in a very unhealthy way by mostly  starving myself, overtraining and purging. For the past month I’ve been  overeating most of the days, since I guess my body was starving and I  gained some of the weight back, as well as the feeling of misery. When I  do this, I buy all the “bad” food that I can find, come home and stuff  myself with it until I fall asleep or can’t breathe anymore. Then I fall  asleep and purge when I wake up. I rarely eat a proper healthy meal,  but I always tell myself that I will. Then I decide not to eat for a  whole day as a restriction and at one point I start starving and I buy  unhealthy food again. And that’s the circle I am in… 

My main problem is that I noticed how this is starting to seriously  effect other fields of my life. I am often depressed but right now  mostly numb to everything, I can’t remember when was the last time I was  happy and laughing, I avoid social events, I don’t eat with other  people, I get foggy brain and I feel cold when I starve myself, I can’t  sleep if I completely don’t stuff myself and my perception of myself is  based solely on how I look and with that also my mood. I only feel  satisfied with my body when I look like a undeveloped girl and it  bothers me when my breast start to show.  I really don’t want to go through those “miserable years” again and I  want to start with my recovery. I have been trying to figure out this by  myself, since seeking professional help is too expensive for me.

Hi, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder for the past twenty  years (yikes), but I have felt I’ve had a pretty good grip on my  recovery.

I’ve noticed one thing in particular that triggers me that I can’t  find info about is whenever I find out about someone who has experienced  addiction, I immediately want to open up to them but don’t, and instead  go into a tailspin of ideas and old habits.

Does this happen to anyone else? Does opening up to them help? I’m  wondering if this is a better approach for me. So many people don’t see  the connection between an eating disorder and, say, alcoholism, and I  would love not to get triggered by someone’s recovery journey even if  it’s not an eating disorder.

My friend of 5+ years who I've known since I was 15 is really worrying me. I'll need to give some context because this is a long story, but I can't just sit and watch what's going on anymore.

He is 25 and about 6'0"" tall. He is very skinny, it is very noticeable when he wears tighter clothing like jeans. Sometimes when he's bad, I can see his skeleton on his chest and his face - his eyes get dark around the sockets and he complains of fatigue and bad moods (could also be job related, he is a hard worker, but runs on fumes and energy drinks to get him through the week).

We've lived together with a few other friends of ours in a house we rent for the past 3 years. I tried to put the idea forward of buying our groceries together weekly and that we could take it in turns cooking a meal every night for each other,  like a family.

Nobody fancied this idea and we just cook for ourselves and occasionally if I make too much I will split my meal in half for one of the other lads. Sometimes I make extra for my friend because he has no food to eat.

This is where the problem is, he doesn't cook at all and never buys proper quantities of food to eat. I don't think I have seen him prepare a proper meal even 10 times in the past 3 years we've been here. He lives on instant noodles, beans and bacon, with toast clumped in butter. Energy drinks and cigarettes. Amd his favourite, takeout Pizza.

Now for the serious part. Just a few months we were in the kitchen and I was cooking me and him dinner, when mid conversation his eyes rolled into the back of his head and he collapsed in front of me. Luckily I caught him and his head before he could hit the floor. After he woke up, he was totally out of it and had no idea of what had just happened. I urged him many a time to go get checked by his GP,  but he hasn't done anything!

On top of this, due to him only spending his wage on expensive takeout pizza/burgers, daily energy drinks, noodles, tobacco and sugary snacks, he is coming short and having to borrow money from me to buy food, but it's all going straight on takeout again.

I'm no nutrition expert but this diet is a recipe for disaster. Not only does he never eat vegetables or fruit, but he doesn't get enough protein or calories to sustain the body of a 25 year old man.

He says every time he will do a proper food shop but he never does, and later that night or the next day it'll be more takeout again... I feel like I'm helping my best friend commit suicide!

How can I help him? Not only is he physically being ruined by this, but mentally he appears to be deteriorating too.

I don't know who to speak to about this because I don't want to seem like I'm obsessing over his life choices, but after knowing the guy for so long and seeing him in clear decline, I think I would be a horrible friend to not try and help him.

I don't think he even knows he has some kind of eating disorder, he seems to just think its normal when it's not.

228,EatingDisorders,"I have struggled with eating since my mid teens, I am 22 (m) now. I’ve struggled with multiple eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, BED. For the greater part of my ED history, I have had the most difficulty with anorexia. At the moment I find myself cycling through all of them: very low cal diet as long as I can while exercising &gt; eventual failure persisted by binge eating leading to intense workouts from post binge guilt. Repeat. Throughout the years, it has never become a severe physical health risk, but I’m quite sure it contributed to the permanent digestive issues that I now have and am medicated for. On the other hand, it has been a never ending torment to my mental health. Within the past 2 years, it has consumed most of my day to day life.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been times where I’ve managed to maintain a healthy eating regimen, but it never lasts. Funnily enough, I feel the most in control when successfully maintaining an eating disorder; it evokes a rewarding feeling. The days in which I’m unsuccessful in my ED ambitions, I feel worthless and shameful. I’m constantly keeping track of certain dates to gauge how I should eat in the following weeks, or, pushing back/cancelling plans if I’m not yet satisfied with my self imposed eating boot camp, if you will.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just really tired of it all. I’m tired of constantly postponing my happiness to some undetermined date that keeps moving further and further away until my body looks a certain way. My stomach sinks every time I realize my youth is passing me by while I wallow in self loathing. Most of all, I feel deep sadness at my inability to self love.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m aware that I use eating disorders to ‘bandaid’ a bigger issue of self perception, and that I would benefit from reaching out to a professional of sorts (which I’m looking into).

I've been in recovery for six years, but relapsed a few months ago. I've never been diagnosed or treated even though I had some pretty significant health impacts. I had three young children at the time, and was embarrassed of my eating disorder so I never sought help. I've managed pretty well until now. I honestly did not think I would ever be engaging in ED behaviors again, but after losing my mom last year, relationship issues, and my youngest having some pretty significant ongoing medical issues I started using it as a coping mechanism and it snowballed from there.

Every single part of me just wants this to quietly go away. The logical part of my brain is screaming at me. I'm in my 30's now, my oldest is 13 not 7, I feel like I've lost every reasonable part of me. I did this before on my own, but I'm really struggling right now. I don't think I want to give up my way of coping, but I recognize the damage I'm doing.

Anyways, we're back to the embarrassment/shame. I live in a small community, I have insurance but no primary physician because I've never been able to make an appointment for a checkup. I don't have a support network outside of the wonderful support system of therapists/teachers for my kiddos.

First of all sorry if what I'm about to say trivializes your real struggles in any way, I don't want to compare my experience to an actual disorder but I'm afraid I may be at the beginning of *something*

First of all, I'm a 29 year-old woman. I don't think any woman in our society has a completely healthy and happy relationship with food and her body but I don't think mine has been especially bad up to this point. I do have bouts of depression related to childhood trauma, and whenever an episode is about to come up I tend to be more uneasy in and critical of my body. I had one of those bouts of depression this summer and really lacked appetite for 2 months. I got better for a short while, started eating again and felt a little bad about getting back to the healthy weight I had been at previously.

Now I'm feeling myself slip into a bad place again, but it's a lot more body and food-focused than it's ever been. I somehow know that my brain is trying to distract me from the trauma and anxiety by dumping all of its attention on calories and the way my thighs look, but I also can't stop thinking about it. This morning I almost panicked in my kitchen at the thought of having some oatmeal. I've never had such a violet reaction at the thought of eating and I'm really worried.

I'm thinking of starting therapy and working through all of this with a professional but I'd like some advice, reassurance, first-hand experience, anything really that you may deem helpful.

231,EatingDisorders,"Recently, I have been wondering if I have an eating disorder. Since  March, I lost a lot of weight without noticing, which started a spiral of working out and eating “right”.

&amp;#x200B;

I eat an average of xxx calories (very low) a day in one meal. Oftentimes much less, and a lot of times what I am taking in is from drinks, not food. I won’t touch soda or dessert at all, and I will obsessively monitor how many calories are in my food so I can decide how much of it I want to eat. Part of it is I’m only hungry for a little, but part of it is deliberate. I have panic attacks when I see how many calories are in restaurant dishes. I often order a small house salad and pick around the cheese and croutons and dress it in lemon juice and pepper or nothing at all. I absolutely will not eat if someone else is not, to the point of starving myself because my partner is not hungry, or whomever I’ve gone out to dinner with just wants to grab drinks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've lost even more weight, but it is considered overweight BMI apparently, so no doctor will believe that I have an eating disorder. I tried detailing how quickly I lost so much weight and my relationship with food, but since I’m overweight and actively dieting, doctors just keep telling me that’s the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I don’t have a problem- maybe it’s all fine. Most of the people in my life brush off my concerns because “everyone feels that way when they’re dieting”. But I don’t think they do. And if they do, I don’t know why anyone would do it. I spend all day obsessing about what and how much I ate and punishing myself if I miss my workout (I hurt my knee really badly pushing myself to keep running after injured it, for one.) I’m miserable most of the time, but I can’t bring myself to eat. Even if I’m hungry.

235,EatingDisorders,"Bit of back story; back in June I was hospitalized after a teacher at school had to get someone to pick me up because they were really concerned, and a a blood test revealed that my phosphate was dangerously low, alongside my potassium, iron and blood sugar... all that fun stuff. It was there that I was actually diagnosed with anorexia- I've denied (and continue to deny) that anything is wrong when literally everyone, myself included knows that, that most definitely isn't the case. After finally being discharged I was kinda forced into recovery... I know I sound ungrateful, I truly am so lucky to have so much support and love, but in all honesty I wish it would just stop. I hate the attention that it's brought to me, I hate that people are almost babying me now. It's like everyone around me is walking on eggshells, being EXTRA nice to the point that it's just ANNOYING. I feel like crap for SO MANY REASONS. Because I was hospitalized I automatically got a place in an ED service in my city, a place that is generally really difficult to get into. I appreciate my dietician and psychologist so, so much BUT- I'm taking a spot from someone who might actually want to recover, someone who isn't just going because that's what has to happen after a hospitalization. As horrible as it sounds (it is) I do not want to recover and I feel so guilty for even thinking this way. I'm lying even more than I did at the peak of my ED- I'm falsifying weigh ins, waiting until my parents aren't looking to dispose of food during meal times and I'm doing unholy things to purge. I'm so full of anger, towards everyone. Towards the people who care for me the most. I'm lashing out at my parents for simply caring, for wanting to just keep me alive, I'm holding a massive grudge towards my teachers for even caring despite knowing that they come from a good place. I can't keep doing this. If even with professional help, I can't seem to want to recover, why should I be taking that place from someone who actually wants to make a change? I'm beyond miserable, I've hit an all time low. I don't feel like I've got anyone to turn to, and all I've been doing is crying and wishing that everyone would just go away and let me do my own thing.

I feel terrified of eating more than one meal a day now, I can't even force myself to go for seconds, I don't know why.

I bought myself cake, ate it and just got upset reading what was in it. Thinking I'm gonna gain weight again.

I'm recovering without a support system, it's a little scary. I keep getting a little jealous that some of my close friends are still restricting and all that. This feeling translates to annoyance whenever I see something about them fasting, restricting, etc. I don't take it out on them, but still. I know recovery is the best choice for me in the long run. But it's so hard to do this alone and it makes me sad that I'm the only one feeling this way among my friends. I don't know how to handle these emotions in a healthy way. Any advice?

I just moved to Korea where I'm gonna be living and working for 1 year+. I'd say I'm pretty much recovered these days but at the moment I'm finding it very difficult to eat properly/enough. In quarantine I lost a small amount of weight but I really can't afford to lose weight.

At home in the UK I was vegan - not for disordered reasons! There is loads of great vegan stuff available in the UK and I enjoyed eating all kinds of vegan junk food. But here in Korea everybody loves meat and fish, kbbq, fried chicken, bulgogi, etc. Even being vegetarian is barely a thing. Realistically don't think I can be fully vegan here cause there's so few options and I'm fairly picky, but the thought of breaking my ""moral code"" (sorry not trying to sound preachy just can't think of a better way to put it) upsets me. I've been vegan for 5 years, before that vegetarian for 3 so now I feel intensely guilty if I eat something non-vegan.

Also I'm finding it tough cause I'm living on my own for the first time in a few years and now that what I eat is totally up to me I find it quite overwhelming. Sometimes I end up skipping meals or only eating a snack because I just don't know what to have, or don't want to keep eating the same stuff over and over.

Anyway I'm not actively trying to restrict or anything just worried about slipping back into disordered habits. My being here is completely tied to my job so I really don't want to get sick and be forced to go back home. Sorry this was kind of rambly. I don't really know what I want from this, I guess just to vent but if anyone can empathise or has any suggestions I'd be so grateful.

This is partly a response to a conversation I had with my roommate, who is plus-sized, and who expressed her frustration with the fact that she has never been able to directly address health concerns with a doctor without the doctor interrupting her concerns to discuss her weight.

Which struck me as odd, because I have been underweight for as long as I can remember, and yet no doctor has ever expressed concerns about it. And I'm not just slightly underweight either--I've always had a wide margin between me and what's considered ""normal"", to the extent that I worry about it.

I had a therapist who expressed concerns about my thought patterns regarding my weight. I've had friends who have repeatedly tried to hold interventions about my weight. But I always have to tell them: I'm not intentionally trying to lose weight, I just can't gain it.

I'm always, always cold. I swear sweaters in August. I passed out so frequently in college that I was famous for it. But even when I've gone to a doctor's and I swooned in the doctor's office and I hit the floor, in front of the nurse, the doctor still did not consider my underweight-ness a problem.

A large reason, I think, that my doctors have never brought up my weight is that I live with IBS, so I'm constantly sick and I don't have much of an appetite, digesting food can be painful, and my body doesn't absorb nutrients very well in the first place. So, whenever my weight comes up, doctors either praise me (which is probably not okay), give me the standard ""wish I had that problem"", or say that it's no problem because I'll gain weight ""eventually"". Some people just go, ""oh, get pregnant, that'll fix it"".

I feel like being underweight is one of those things that could be a risk factor for pregnancy complications so I think perhaps doctors should not recommend I do that.

My mother says I can't help it because I'm exactly like her. I inherited her intestinal distress, but my mom never eats. Never. I remember very few times in my childhood that my mother ate more than once a day. She would only ever prepare food if my father was home. And then she wouldn't eat it.

I work really hard to make myself eat. I buy foods that are easy to prepare, that are supposed to be healthy and make my intestines work. But it's still difficult to make myself interested in eating. I might go all day without bothering.

Sometimes, I'm told that my lack of interest in eating is just my depression and that the stomach upset is just my anxiety (it's definitely related). Also, whenever I express a concern about my weight, I am immediately asked about my sexual orientation. Maybe I'm being overly sensitive, because I do understand that LGBTQ+ communities are disproportionately affected by EDs, but my warning flags always go up when doctors seem a little too interested in my sexual orientation.

I've been told that being underweight is very unhealthy but I can't find much information about it. The second I search for it online, all I get are diet tips. Not helpful! The opposite of helpful! I also can't find anything about being underweight that isn't tied to eating disorders. Do they always go together?

TW: Laxative abuse.

I’m a 37-year-old woman who has been “recovered” from bulimia for about 20 years. I say “recovered” because while I’ve stopped the daily purging, I still occasionally fall back on ED behaviors. I’m fully aware of this and won’t lie to myself.

About 2 weeks ago, I was constipated. Stimulant laxatives are a MAJOR no-no for me. Even with my sporadic disordered eating, I will not touch them.

I stupidly convinced myself that a diet tea was a better alternative. “It’s made from plant extracts,” I told myself. How bad could it be?

Really bad. Really really bad. I drank too much - like I fucking should have known I would - and now my digestive system is wrecked.

It’s been a week since I last had the tea and my stomach is still hyper sensitive. Eating anything other than binding foods sends me running to the bathroom within an hour of my meal. I can’t eat while I’m working. I can’t eat before bed.

My fiancé has been in recovery for a few months now, and while it had been going really well, the past few weeks have been dreadful during meals. A couple of weeks ago, we went to the doctor together, and she came out in tears because her weight was higher than she’s ever seen it. She said it was my fault because of all the meals I make us, and she accused me of trying to make her fat. Ever since, she has been declining all meals, and reacting incredibly negatively to my prodding.

I’ve had an eating disorder myself, so I’ve always tried to be gentle but insistent with her when she doesn’t want to eat, but that’s becoming much harder to do.

It was terrifying to see her like that, Beyond tonight, I’ve made many meals where she angrily throws it in the trash only few minutes removed from her begging me to make it for her. She also cries during almost every meal and sometimes even collapses to the floor in hysterics. It’s really hard on me because at her core, I know she wants to get better. When she throws away food, she trues to dig it out and eat it, and her outbursts are always followed by some form of “I’m sorry. I don’t know why I don’t get better for us.” My heart is breaking.

248,EatingDisorders,"i've been struggling with anorexia since i was 14 (though i've never been officially diagnosed). it was horrible and life-threatening, but by the time i was 17 i was able to heal my thoughts without professional treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm 21 now, in the midst of a brutal relapse; i am getting help for the first time in my life — likely residential. i relapsed primarily because i have unpacked intense trauma in the last few months, which sent me spiraling and wanting control.

&amp;#x200B;

but i'm feeling so intensely conflicted. my ED voice is still extremely stuck in how it was when i was 14: degrading, obsessed with food and behaviors, consuming my whole day, feeling proud when i lose weight, and having a goal weight.

&amp;#x200B;

but, my 21 year old voice WANTS to recover so badly. i worked so hard to love my body and be healthy, and i have a ton of reasons to recover. i'm also a trans woman, so having feminine features means a lot to me — i want my boobs and curves back that i worked so hard for.

&amp;#x200B;

I (24F) have been recovering from an eating disorder for the past 5 years. My flatmate (25F) and I have been living together for the past year in a very strict lockdown and it was really wonderful, we would cook and eat together at least twice a day and the food was always delicious and nutritious. Recently she has returned from a summer abroad with her family who are obsessed with looks and superficial things like that. Now that we’re living together again she is absolutely dead set on losing weight and keeps avoiding cooking together because all she wants to eat are vegetables. She wants to meal prep the same thing in advance because it stops her eating too much. She’s also skipping loads of meals, this morning she bragged to me about not eating dinner and skipping breakfast when we were having lunch together. She also is always complaining about how her clothes don’t fit her anymore because she is losing weight. Not only am I worried about her but I am also worried about myself. Being around her is very triggering to me. I don’t really know what to do. She’s a wonderful person and aside from this I really like her and get on with her. I don’t know what to do about it or how to tell her her behavior is triggering for me. it’s really difficult with all the comments about losing weight and just watching her restrict her diet. I don’t want to come off controlling or domineering but I don’t know how much longer I can last without asking her to stop doing this. She knows that I have a history with disordered eating.

Whenever I successfully lower my heartrate, my heart starts beating really fast again. I also find that my mind is always running. I keep thinking about the bakery I like, how I pushed my friends away by dieting, and how I feel really alone in my dessert cravings (nobody seems to struggle with this). When I checked my watch: I got 1/4 the deep sleep I usually get.

So here is the dilemma, I'm ready to start a healthy weightloss journey, but i need advice on how. My mind instantly goes to calorie counting and all that and I KNOW thats not what i should do.

I've long been suffering from a restrictive ED. I've been told by multiple professionals and resources that the only way for me to recover from my ED is first and foremost to 'stop restricting'. However, no one ever explained to me what that means in practice.

Because to me, right now, 'stop restricting' means just binging. There is NO amount, type or combination of food that ever satisfies me to the fullest extent. I always want to eat more. So anything other than ""eat forever"" is actually restriction.

I'm being followed by a therapist AND a dietitian but both of them no longer really know what to do with me because I'm never getting better and if anything I'm regressing. That's because on one hand the dietitian prescribed me a meal plan which, however balanced and carefully crafted it is, still feels like restriction to me - I have to eat 'normal portions' at certain times etc. - and on the other hand the therapist's been doing mental work with me that has been incredibly helpful to let me understand so many things about me and my personality and has made me progress so much in several aspects of my life, but has changed absolutely NOTHING about my ED behaviours.

Basically I follow this supposedly balanced, abundant and adequate meal plan for a while, maybe I gain some weight, but the meals never satisfy me and it feels like I'm restricting all the time, waiting for the next meal to come, always obsessing about food etc., so at some point I ditch the meal plan because if I have to restrict then I wanna do it on my own terms. So then after a while I just get fed up and I'm so ravenous that I actually do decide to 'stop restricting', so then I end up eating all the time and binge on thousands of calories, which then I promptly purge because I cannot stand the weight gain....blah blah blah, it's a very known common cycle.

I feel so lost and don't know what to do. I feel like I'll have to restrict my whole life because I cannot fathom ever being satisfied by a 'normal meal' ever again, yet I can't just binge my face off every single day. I'm not even underweight anymore like I used to so maybe I'm just broken. But the point is, all these people that say 'stop restricting' seem to actually mean 'stop restricting *below a normal amount of food*', they don't ACTUALLY mean 'stop restricting for real' and it's so frustrating.",,Request: How can I 'stop restricting' without starting binging?,9,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,pe5hd1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/pe5hd1/request_how_can_i_stop_restricting_without/,1630276842,430,0,0,0,-1,1,"Restrictive eating disorder, prescribed meal plan that feels like restriction",harmful,"The individual feels lost and frustrated because they don't know how to ""stop restricting"" without feeling like they are either binging or still restricting, Therapist has been helpful with mental work but has not changed the individual's eating disorder behaviors","Being told to ""stop restricting"" without clear guidance or explanation of what that means in practice",harmful,"Feeling lost and unsure of how to recover from restrictive eating disorder, Struggling to follow a meal plan that feels like restriction and constantly obsessing about food, Cycling between restriction and bingeing/purging","Following a meal plan that feels like restriction, struggling to understand what ""stop restricting"" means in practice",harmful,"Feeling lost and unsure of how to recover from their restrictive eating disorder, Experiencing a cycle of bingeing and purging due to feeling unsatisfied by meals, Feeling frustrated by the lack of clarity around what ""stop restricting"" means"

In more recent years, I feel that I have the capability to gain weight but I simply find myself not eating enough. Last year, I blamed my weight loss on going to college and not liking the food provided, but this summer I have been home with good food at my disposal and I think I almost eat less. I feel like I’m not doing it on purpose, or that I have a good reason, I’m just not interested or don’t think about it. I am also noticeably getting full faster. I’m sure this is negatively affecting my health but I don’t know how to fix it. Plus, I’m about to move back on campus and I’m afraid I will continue getting progressively worse.

&amp;#x200B;

And it’s not like I don’t get hungry. Like both today and yesterday, I got hungry but I just didn’t eat. I ate one meal throughout the entire day and just ignored my hunger. Why would I do that?

265,EatingDisorders," 

I (26M) have been with my GF (26F) for almost two years now. When I met her, she was at a healthy weight, thin, but healthy.

I already knew that, a few years prior to us getting together, she was hospitalized for anorexia nervosa and low weight. She talked about it with normalcy, and it was clear she was better.

During the first few months, she ate normally, and aside from a few comments about her not being perfectly happy with her body, she was stable and mostly okay. 6 months in, she had her first real episode. She said that she was obese and that she wanted to lose X amount of weight. I discouraged it, tried to be supportive, but she was set on losing weight.

I guess at this point I have to talk about her family. Her parents are just terrible, unsupportive and judgmental. Her mother is manipulative and extremely toxic, and her father is a bigot. Their way of dealing with her being unwell is telling or forcing her to eat, calling her names, or lashing out at her.

The thing is, she cares more about what her parents have to say than anything in the world. She craves their approval (which they never give) and makes them a part of everything, knowing that they're going to make everything ten times worse.

She looked like she was getting better, but then she was diagnosed with lactose and fructose intolerance, on top of her celiac disease. This has just been devastating to her mental health and her struggle against anorexia. It started by her losing a bit of weight because her stomach hurts every time she eats, and then it spiraled out of control. To her, the weight she's lost is gone forever, not the consequence of an illness that needs to be corrected, but the start of a weight loss journey.

She's already at the point of being medically underweight, but that doesn't matter. She sets the goal of losing X amount of weight, promising that she will be happy with her body then, then she reaches that weight and moves the goalposts to an even lower weight. Recently she's said that she wants to be exactly at the weight where she's not going to be hospitalized, even though that's severely underweight by any metric.

Sometimes she weighs herself and tries to celebrate with me that she's lost weight. I don't know if that's her trying to manipulate me into enabling her or just an attention-seeking behaviour, but it always leads to her being disappointed and sad that I don't celebrate with her. I don't scold her or anything, I just mention that I wish she didn't put such an emphasis on her weight.

I also can't just try to keep her mind off her weight or weight loss in general. Anything and everything can be twisted to talk about her desire to weight less and her disgust with her body. Try to play a videogame? If the player's avatar can be customized, she will make the most underweight character possible, spending ages trying to ""get the proportions right"". Reading a book? Is any of the characters fat? What do they eat?

She also suffers from GAD and, I suspect, from depression, which she absolutely refuses to even consider. She doesn't enjoy any of her old hobbies, she can't finish books or series, she just browses TikTok endlessly. She used to love her job, now she dreads going back (she's on sick leave). I have to push her to text her best friend of ten years. This all screams ""depression"" to me, someone who has gotten better from depression myself.

She's extremely intelligent and a nurse, which allows her to hide her symptoms when she talks to her psychologist and psychiatrist. She convinces all of her healthcare providers that she's just suffering from anxiety.

I love her, and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. She's everything I could ask for in a woman, but I feel like that woman is slowly being replaced by her illness. I can count with one hand the times that we've had a genuinely good time that didn't involve sex in the last 6 months. I can't go for a walk with her, as not only she doesn't want to leave the house for anything other that driving to go grocery shopping or seeing her parents, but most she will get light-headed if she walks for five minutes.

Last year, during the pandemic, her mother was making her have an anxiety attack everyday, making her life miserable. Throwing her things away (including a gift from her late best friend, who committed suicide years ago), insulting her, shouting, and my GF even told me about an incident when her mother called her obese.

All of this led me to look for an place so we could live together and get her out of her parent's house. This has been at the expense of my own goals. I was studying to get a job that would grant me economical stability for the rest of my life, and I've put that on hold to get a job and pay rent. I've even been on sick leave myself because of migraines I think are associated with stress.

She refuses therapy or treatment on the basis that ""all therapists ask her the same things"". She found A therapist that she liked last year, and left because €70 an hour was ""too expensive"", a few months after buying a €1100 iPhone, and a few months before spending more than €1000 on an iPad, and I offered to help her pay for it despite barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and her father being loaded. Money isn't the issue, and when she feels that she works well with a therapist, she leaves. I know that's what her illness compels her to do, but I cannot help but feel like she doesn't want to get better, and will actively work against it.

Yesterday she said that she wants to have children because that would help her feel better about herself. First, even if I found that believable, which I don't, I think it's horrible to bring a baby into this world as some kind of therapy. Second, she freaks out when her period makes her look a tiny little bit bloated, and I'm genuinely terrified of how she will react to pregnancy.

I'm at my wits end. I know it is not my job to ""fix"" her, but I feel like she just wants me to enable her self-destructive habits and refuses to even make an effort to get better. I would jump in front of a train for her, but I've spent the last year trying to prevent her from jumping in front on a train herself, and I don't think I have it in me anymore. I don't know how to deal with this situation anymore.

Looking for advice on how to help my sister. A little overwhelmed with all the information.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister came to me last night and told me she'd been losing a lot of weight and she doesn't feel good, she doesn't feel healthy. She's losing natural body fat and muscle mass. She tried working out to help build body mass but the next day she was bed bound because she had burned calories and stuff during the work out that she doesn't have to burn.

&amp;#x200B;

She told me she will only eat so many calories in a day but most days will not eat. That if she eats something that is more calories than she has set limit to she won't eat for days after to make up for it. But then sometimes she will binge eat and then not eat anything for days after again and she feels really guilty when she binges and that's why she won't eat for days after.

&amp;#x200B;

This has started due to stress and money constraints. She lives on her own and doesn't make a lot of money.

&amp;#x200B;

She mostly eats vegetables and fruits and tofu. She's not a big meat eater.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked if she had done any research and she said she tried but it scared her. So I offered to look into it for her and provide her with information she is looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

However I don't know where to start. I don't even know what for of eating disorder this is classified as.

&amp;#x200B;

I googled, I looked through the links on this sub and I tried looking at some other posts but this is all very overwhelming and I'm just hoping someone can maybe help advise on some things that maybe I don't know or which direction to start.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, my BMI still counts as normal. Basically, I never had any problems with being under/overweight but I always counted calories and felt bad about eating, especially when I binged a couple of times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have been severely restricting my meals lately. I still eat every 4 to 5 hours because of gastritis (severe heartburn if I fast too often), but I'm still hungry 24/7. I used to do intermittent fasting and I loved doing that, but had to stop. Also I have been doing cardio everyday, not as a ""cheat way"" to eat more, but because I just want to speed up the process. Very low cal and cardio have nuked my weight in the last month.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the thing is that I absolutely hate not only my body, but also any sort of fat in me, especially the belly area. To me, I just think I'm in a super strict diet and took some inspiration from pro-anorexia communities. And probably because of this, I developed some very bad habits such as weighing multiple times a day and basically I just got addicted to seeing the numbers go down every single day.

When I was 14, I started struggling a lot with my weight. It was all I could think about, and I started eating a lot less. I don't want to go into everything that happened during this time, but my behavior was definitely concerning. The only reason it didn't get worse was because of a traumatic event that occurred that made it hard to think about anything else. Obviously the thoughts and certain behaviors didn't completely go away, but it wasn't as much of a problem. I'm 17 now.

If I gain even a little bit of weight, I hate myself and immediately start eating less. I frequently think I weigh too much (I'm currently at a healthy weight), and have thoughts of restricting my eating daily. The only reason I haven't is because my energy decreases very quickly and I feel like I'm going to pass out, become extremely dizzy, and can hardly stand up if I go more than 4-5 hours without food, whether I'm hungry or not.

That's quite literally the only thing preventing me from eating less, and I hate it. I don't feel like any of my thoughts or feelings regarding my weight and food in general are serious enough because I don't have a choice but to eat every few hours, even if it's just a small snack, so I don't pass out.

274,EatingDisorders,"Hi all, I’m a 20 year old with ADHD and ASD. Just thought I’d ask for advice because my behavior recently has become kinda concerning, but I’m not really sure who to talk to or what it is exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, over the past week or so, I’ve been dehydrating myself—which is something I’ve done before, but usually I can talk myself out of it before it gets this bad. It’s been taking over my life and making it difficult for me to do anything else, as well as affecting me physically by making me very constipated (sorry for TMI), but for whatever reason I can’t stop. I don’t know how long this is going to last, and I’m worried I might eventually stop drinking water altogether and land myself in the hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve mostly been eating food like normal, though. The few times I skipped meals, it was because I was worried eating would make me thirsty and I’d end up drinking water, and I hated the thought of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m okay with my weight and body shape, so I know this isn’t related to a body image issue. Honestly, I think it’s just a really shitty grab for control. For whatever reason, I experience a lot of anxiety around peeing (I’m sorry, I know that doesn’t make sense but I just do lmao), and dehydrating limits my bathroom trips which is nice and also kinda why I started in the first place lmao. The problem is I know this could damage my body if I continue, but I can’t stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I didn’t know where else to ask. Could this be an ED, but somehow only with water/liquids and not food??? Or is it something else—my gut says maybe OCD, but I’m not sure if it can manifest this way, does anyone have experience with that??? I’m kind of at a loss here and I’d appreciate if anyone else has any input.

Hi, I've struggled with what I believe to be an eating disorder for about a year now, although the intensity of it has fluctuated. I've recently started eating normally again, eating a regular amount of calories opposed to the amount I was eating, so about xxx more (I think I should add that I've always just fasted and worked out, never purged). But with this I've noticed I've started getting way hungrier, like usually I can last about 24 hours without eating and feel alright but since I've been eating better I can only last about 8. I guess this is just my body getting back into how it used to be but it's all happened so suddenly, and its weird because I didn't even do this with the intent to ""recover"", I've just been eating more. Is this normal? Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this increased hunger?

Hi, my girlfriend is struggling with an ED and I really don’t know how to help her properly. I’ve done my research to better understand how an eating disorder works, what it does, what it feels like, and what it is. I know so much more than I did initially, but because of the distance between me and her I still don’t know what to do or say properly.

I understand I don’t have the power to fix this problem, I understand I can’t control how she eats or perceives herself, and I am not in control of her relapses. I encourage her to talk about how she feels and I try to be there to listen more than anything else. If she doesn’t want to talk about it or feels uncomfortable I let her know it’s okay and I change the subject. I let her know she is important and she matters, as well as her health.

I suggested to her a doctor or therapist but she doesn’t think her condition needs help. She doesn’t want to seek help or get better, and I understand I am not in control of that. It hurts my heart when she talks to me about her negative self image, and talks about getting worse. I feel really helpless in situations like this and I don’t know what to say that would help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Other the past few months, the obsession with food returned. I'd been dieting healthily for about a year and I was finally seeing results. One day, I drove out to the closest McDonald's as a quick snack before I headed home after work and ordered a cheeseburger... Something I haven't eaten in years.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like that was my kryptonite. I didn't enjoy it one bit. But one visit a week turned into two... Turned into every other day... Turned into every day. More and more food every time, even when I'm not hungry.

I don't purge, and while I do feel the need to afterwards because I'm so full and know all my hard work losing weight properly is literally being undone, I can't bring myself to.

&amp;#x200B;

I hide the food I buy - I'll only go out and eat when I know there's no one at home so I can bring it back secretly and inhale it.

This isn't how I felt with bulimia. I felt in control there. Here, I feel like I'm powerless to these urges and it's just making my unhealthy mentally and physically after all my hard work after my recovery.

Hi!

I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I've been on and off restricting for years now. I had good months, bad ones but I've never needed help. Recently I had a really bad few months, it took very long and I was getting worried. Restricting never lasted so long before. I went to my doctor and he advised to visit a dietician but I'm still young and studying and do not have money for that. Instead I decided to let go of all my food rules. I started slow, including fear foods in my daily diet, but now I started binging. I did some research and I think it might be extreme hunger. I do not know it is possible for me to experience it. I can just eat and eat and eat until I'm so stuffed I've never been before and all I can do is think about my next meal. It takes an hour or so and I'm hungry again. I've tried to not give in, but I read that you should give in to this extreme hunger so I did for a week or so. Today alone I ate as much as I would in 2,5 days. I've gained some weight already (note: I've never been underweight and have always had a healthy weight) I feel fat, sick and I end up crying in my bed everyday because of how much I ate. I can't believe I'm still hungry after all I've eaten.

Is this extreme hunger or binging? And does anyone have any tips for recovering without any help?

I'll eat sometimes nothing all day, other times I'll eat just breakfast, and then dinner. sometimes for dinner I eat a proper portion, sometimes it's just a piece of toast or some small fruit or veg. every day I weigh myself and if I'm not under a specific weight I'll skip breakfast and eat a smaller dinner.

293,EatingDisorders,"in the past year i (19f) gained weight and it’s easily noticeable, i don’t even fit into the clothes i bought in december (which were already bigger than what i used to wear). i’m stuck in the mindset that i should purposefully not eat for an extended period of time to punish myself for eating out or having certain high calorie foods. for example, if i go out with friends and we all go to a restaurant, i’d be very self conscious about what i eat there but still feel very ashamed when i come home, that i feel like i need to not eat for the next day. naturally i’d get hungry, but i’d think that giving in to the hunger is a sign of weakness and i should hold out on not eating. i beat myself up for getting hungry, and when i finally do eat something it’s like i completely failed my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

when it comes to the choice of food, i think i have an addiction to spending money on takeout or delivery rather than making something healthier at home. i can’t control the urges to pick up my phone and order something (often in bigger amounts than i need), and feel disgusted and angry at myself for doing that after i’ve eaten. the cycle repeats itself from there, so i’d go through eating a lot —&gt; not eating to punish myself.

&amp;#x200B;

i know it’s not healthy but i hate the way i look so much and i want to be like my friends who try on a medium at the store and still feel it’s too “loose” on them. i’ve been skinny growing up and was labelled underweight, but in the past couple years with lockdown, medication and health issues i’ve had to repurchase my entire wardrobe because nothing i had fits me anymore. i feel so fat and ashamed that i’m no longer a size X, and so guilty that i can’t control my urges to eat.

295,EatingDisorders,"I have unhealthy body image issues, but only when I'm underweight. I would love to know if anyone can relate. I used to have some disordered eating patterns in my late teens (I'm currently 24). I've always been on the lower end of the healthy BMI range. I do fluctuate a bit, like most people do, but I'm usually comfortable in my body no matter what shape it's in. I don't really feel the need or desire to lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when I do happen to lose weight, as I recently unintentionally did, it sometimes triggers something in me. Whenever I reach or cross the threshold of being underweight, I become hyper-aware of my body. I look at the signs of being a tad too skinny (very visible collarbones, sternum slightly poking through, etc.). I don't think it's particularly attractive, but I'm not repulsed by it either; instead it's almost like I'm fascinated by it. Body-image wise, I know that if I were to gain the weight back and be within my typical range, I would feel perfectly fine, and I wouldn't think about it anymore - I'd be back to normal. I'd be happy to get some volume back in my chest, in fact. It's not even that big of difference in my weight or how my body looks, but just knowing I'm under the normal range is what triggers me. A part of me wants to stay this way. I think I like the idea of being ""tiny"", and maybe even of people expressing concern for me. I hate that mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

And I hate that I wasn't even actively trying to lose it, but now that I have, I need to be careful. The few times I noticed this in the past, I got out of it pretty easily. I have no issues with food anymore, and eat rather intuitively. But over the last few months, due to depression and medication, my appetite and interest in food are lower, so it's easier to think that my weight loss is ""inevitable"", and harder to get back to normal. I'm not restricting myself, but I'm also not putting in the effort to eat more.

Hey all. Recently I walked in on my wife self purging. Since we have had some talk related to the ED, her, and my role in her recovery. Today, maybe 7 months after, somethings still seem odd/ off but I can't keep asking her all the time.

 1) she reports it's been some time since the last purge. But she does to the bath room during meals. Now, to me, it sounds like there is a very quick like burst of water that enters the toilet then 5 seconds later the sound of a woman peeing. I thought a pre pee poop, but it's all the time. Do people with ED purge that fast?

 2) pre bed habits- again the bathroom thing, then after a flush she stands by the toilet a little long (again like 10 seconds). Brushes teeth, then flossing like crazy. She will take a shot of backing soda. Drink some water, then make a baking soda water. She reports acid reflex. 

3) does this seem like behaviors of it being a daily thing? Is it that fast or if she's in the bathroom for 45 seconds I shouldn't worry? Are these eating disorder coaches a real thing? She listens to odd pod cast sometimes and they talk about body issues (maybe positive things but I have only heard negative). Then how can I help or ask? We've been trying for a year and half for a kid and we both are ""normal"" but I don't think she told Docs about a ED. Would it be an issue if it was every now and then or is it an issue because it's more often then she tells me?

Appreciate your thoughts sorry it's a lot. I'm just looking to see if I'm super crazy or not. I am trying to change my own thoughts on this so I may better trust her to tell me the whole truth.

299,EatingDisorders,"Hi guys ! I (31F) have had problems with food since I was a teenager principally due to my grandmother, who I was living with at the time, always putting me on diet and commenting my physic (which btw was absolutely fine at the time). Since then I developed ED and did a lot of yoyos : I am either on diet and losing weight or doing hyperphagia and binge eating. I am always obsessed with food and thinking about it. I am always craving almost everything but mainly sweets. I just gave birth 5 months ago and I really took a lot of weight and I am now obese. I am extremely sad to be fat again and feel awful all the time, envying other girls in the street or on internet. I also had a fight recently with my partner who basically doesn’t understand why I am always struggling and I can’t simply « lose weight since I don’t want to stay fat anymore ».

Now I would like to find a balanced way of eating and I am very motivated to start 18:6 intermittent fasting. I’ve tried it these two past days and feeling good since it restricts the windows where I can eat and thanks to this I can think of something else but food during the fasting time. I try to stick to healthy food during the hours where I can eat. Only I am worried if it is safe for me to continue on this way or will it likely trigger my ED.

I also have a mom, twin sister, and older brother (m25). Of the siblings I am the closest with my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

My Dad is a no-nonsense, no-emotion, would never ask for help, would never go for counselling kind of guy. However he has lost a significant amount of weight over the summer due to his small meals, and his 3-6 hours of exercise a day. My whole family is aware of his current habits.

&amp;#x200B;

He normally has oatmeal for breakfast, an apple or carrots for lunch, and a really small dinner (like a salad). First of all he is not even eating enough for someone his size even if the person was inactive. Second, because he works out so much he should be eating way more. He is also constantly weighing himself and bringing up his weight in conversation, saying that he thought he should have lost more weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to help him, but this is different because it’s my dad, and because he has a tricky ego complex. How do I encourage healthy habits and how do in recommend that he seeks medical advice?

I’ve been restricting my food for awhile as well as on and off counting calories (habits which I get from being a competitive gymnast). Recently it’s gotten much worse and I’m not sure why… I basically eat a peach for breakfast, an apple for lunch, try to workout to “remove” the calories of what I ate.

It got better over the years, then worse, then better again. I’ve never truly “recovered”, just very high highs and very low lows. I spent my sophomore year starving myself, then my junior year is when I started purging.

&amp;#x200B;

It got so bad that I was vomiting blood and knew i needed to get help, but I couldn’t bring myself to confess why. My mother just thought I was very sick. Went to a gastroenterologist, got put on a few medications, I even ended up getting a damn endoscopy / colonoscopy. The whole time I knew that this was all for nothing and the guilt only fueled my disorder. At some point, the purging turned into another form of self harm.

&amp;#x200B;

I got better after that, and I’d been better for the past two years, but it’s back. It’s back and it’s worse than it’s ever been. I can’t eat anything without purging. Even if I plan on keeping food down, I panic and purge. The past two days I just haven’t eaten because I don’t want to purge.

**TL;DR Sister is getting help in public hospital but her treatment seems too restrictive and we worry it's going to make things worse**

&amp;#x200B;

My sister(19) has been purging for months and her weight is at an all time low, also starting to showing symptoms like muscle pain, teeth problems these few weeks. From what we know she's also diagnosed with anxiety but not delusional, is very smart and highly self aware of her problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Few days ago her counsellor advised her to be institutionalized, she agreed so we took her to a public hospital and she just got transferred to a mental unit yesterday, with her consent of course. By then all her personal items are taken away, which I understand. **Problem is they also took away her books, which to me seems very innocuous. We were told that the psychiatrist won't be able to see her until a week later. She probably won't have a counsellor aside from drugs. Also visitors are not allowed, not because of covid, but it's just a rule.**

&amp;#x200B;

It's great to have free healthcare here and I understand inpatient treatment comes with a lot of restrictions, the lack of doctors is a sad reality we have to accept, but the book thing seems too extreme to us. But if they're giving her all this free time and not doing anything special, why can't she at least read?

&amp;#x200B;

Is inpatient treatment supposed to be this restrictive? We're tempted to get her out of there however we can't afford private hospitals.

307,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been living with restrictive eating for 30+ years, I have severe PTSD and moderate to severe depression plus now, a little postpartum (hormones and all) added in. I gained… well we don’t do numbers here so I’ll tell you I doubled in size during pregnancy because the second I found out I stopped restricting bc I was worried about the baby and woooow it went on fast.

&amp;#x200B;

I had my little princess 7 months ago- there were problems. She is ok and healthy and bouncy, I am still doing physical therapy and occupational therapy and speech. Getting better but not where I need to be yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I lost most of the baby weight within 4 months. Hubby pointed out he doesn’t want me to ever be sooooo small again as I got after our first child (I almost died from it). I spoke to my trauma therapist and most of my motivation actually came from wanting to set a better example for my daughter on what a good relationship with food and your own body can be. With his help, I started treatment for ED (now with new onset of binging and purging associated with a self destructive mindset that awakens during flashbacks or whenever I’m physically unable to do things).

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been slowly increasing intake with my team and doing all the feelings stuff etc. within 4 weeks of starting, I gained it ALL back and then some. I’m now well above a healthy BMI. I asked about it and whether I could start trying to slow the gain soon- I was told to love myself even if I get huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what to do. My goals of losing the baby weight are being ignored, I don’t want to do it in a disordered way but I want to feel normal again.

308,EatingDisorders,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

So, first of all, I am 16 and male (trans). My weight is normal.

Ever since I was little, I would feel really uncomfortable with the thought of being overweight or overeating, to the point where I would cry because the thoughts wouldn't leave me alone. They'd come when I was around food, so in ""normal"" circumstances, or at completely random times. Sometimes I'd imagine people I know overeating/being overfed, and gaining a lot of weight - not on purpose, of course.

&amp;#x200B;

To this day, I have this same problem. I'm still getting sick from these thoughts and I generally avoid eating too much for that same reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started puberty, I also started gaining weight, which is normal, but I hated it. I loathed having fat rolls here and there, or a small double chin, or a stomach that wasn't unrealistically flat. Fot that reason, I started restricting my eating habits around two years ago. Skipping full meals doesn't work when I'm at home, so I just do that when I'm not - which is about once a week. I then skip lunch entirely and only eat a small dinner. Other than that, I try not to eat unhealthy snacks. I often realise how much I've eaten on a day and I then get angry at myself and start crying again. Reading about calories just makes me feel bad over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I really love cooking and baking, and during lockdown I used to bake a lot, but I rarely ever ate what I made, out of fear. Outside of that, I mostly stayed at home during that time, so I was even more concerned with my own weight.

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried to work out. I'm sadly not a very disciplined person, so I rarely ever actually work out, but I really hate myself for this every night. My weight and the way my body looks just makes me cry and I am trying my best to change this.

311,EatingDisorders," 

Several years ago my stepdaughter was admitted to the hospital almost in a coma because her mom had starved her over time. From what I gather, the mother was convinced they should only eat organic/non-gmo (which isn’t a bad thing ofc), but there are a lot of holes in the story. For one, the mom was underweight but relatively healthy. My stepdaughter weighed half what would have been appropriate.

Now she’s better, in terms of getting enough calories. Shes still in a skilled nursing facility because, while she’s out of the woods, her mom has bred distrust and apathy. The thinking is sort of ‘why bother doing for myself because I just always hurt and everyone is mad at me and I’ll just try to be very small so as not to bother…’ It’s problematic, but my goals are to bolster self esteem and confidence.

Anyway she’s at goal weight but someone suggested her skewed view of food and eating might mean she has an eating disorder(?)

This is new for me but I think counseling would help. I’m encouraging her to talk to someone (she has access but no desire). Beyond that, though, I’d like to find out what small things I can do to assist.

Is this an ED? Could her constant pain be a lasting effect? What other lasting effects could this have caused?

Does anyone know of any books or theories that may be helpful? Or if anyone has gone through this sort of Munchausen(by proxy)-esque forced/complicit starvation..?

I’m not really sure where to start, besides just being super patient and encouraging. I feel like I could do more to support her recovery.

When  I was 16 I obsessed with my weight and weighed myself multiple times a  day. If the number changed even a little I was immediately restricting  my already extremely restricted diet. My parents would always serve me  up a smaller portion of food compared to my brothers. I barely ate and  if I gained any weight my Mum would comment on me getting chubby, and  grab any belly fat that I had. For reference I was about 5'8 at the time  and weighed xx kgs (normal range). I thought I was fat. When my parents weren't looking  I would sneak into the pantry and binge on any and all 'bad' food I  could. I would eat the baking chocolate, biscuits, museli bars,  everything. My parents kept bells on their snack cupboard so we couldn't  help ourselves, it'd been this way since we were little and continued  until we moved out.  I eventually got a job in a supermarket and had  ready access to foods I wasn't 'allowed because they'd make me fat' so I  started bingeing at work, buying copious amounts of food at work and  stuffing my face on my breaks. I'd come home and hide food in my room.  This lead to massive weight gain and more and more comments my weight  and appearance. I thought I looked disgusting but couldn't stop.  Eventually things balanced out and I lost a lot of the extra weight  through reducing sugar and healthy eating along with exercise. But I  still saw myself as fat. Still couldn't see that I'd changed my body. 

Since then, I have a horrible relationship with my body and with  food. I struggle with body dysmorphia on the daily. Some days seeing  myself as so huge and disgusting I want to never look at myself again,  and others viewing myself as 'normal' but then not fitting into my  clothes size as they're suddenly too small. And so the cycle goes, round  and around. 

I hide food constantly, sneak snacks, binge on foods like I'll never  have it again, then buy more. I feel so ashamed tucking away bags of  m&amp;Ms or bars of chocolate but can't help it, I crave the sugar and  snacks and can't stop myself. 

I have had a baby, 11mo, and my body has changed again. Breastfeeding  has me starving 80% of the time and often I get so hungry there doesn't  feel like any time at all to make food so I reach for what is ready  available- which often means things that are higher in calories and  sugar. I am huge, the biggest I've ever been on the scale. I'm obsessed,  and most of the time hate the way I look. Each time I see a photo of  myself or see my reflection, all I see is the fat, the chin, my  stomach... I adore my stretch marks because they're a sign of my baby,  permanently carved into my body, but the weight that goes along with  it... I hide my body under baggy clothes... I don't know what to do. 

I don't have the energy to work out, I'm dealing with a broken bone  that is still causing pain 5 months later... Pain all over my body...

My b/p has gotten absolutely out of control lately  and I'm scared to DEATH. I've been struggling with occasional purging  for a few years now but my main problem used to be restriction and until  the last couple months I had never purged this much this frequently.  I'm already feeling the physical effects, my mouth is sore, my teeth  feel sensitive and my stomach burns.

I really really need to stop asap. But I know that if I stop purging I  will just keep binging and the mere thought of weight gain completely  terrifies me. I've tried keeping a binge down but the feeling of dread  and sheer panic over weight gain was completely unbearable so I only  lasted less than an hour before rushing to the toilet.

The fact is, I'm no longer underweight so I feel like I have no  ""room"" to binge anymore, which only worsens the anxiety around binges.

I've tried everything. I have a therapist who no longer knows what to  do with me because I never improve. I have a meal plan and it's not  helping. I try following it and eating ""balanced meals"" and they never  satisfy me so in the end I binge anyway. I don't understand the concept  of ""stop restricting"" because for me it just means binging (and  generally eating ALL THE FOOD). I'm not underweight and I'm only a few  lbs below my pre-ED weight so that cannot make much of a difference.  With my therapist I've even tried to journal to detect if my binges are  associated to any emotional patterns but we couldn't find any. I binge  when I'm happy and when I'm sad, I binge when I have a lot of feelings  to process and when everything's quiet, I binge when I'm busy and when  I'm not busy, I binge when I have lunch and when I don't. And then  obviously I purge every single time because I can't stand the weight  gain.

I'm constantly hungry, constantly scared and nervous and don't know  what to do anymore. I feel completely desperate and hopeless.

I have dealt with an eating disorder as a form of self harm  (restricting and purging) for about two years. It was mostly unrelated  to weight as I was already underweight when it started. As time went on I  punished myself for being so underweight that I would continue to  starve myself. I've been recoved for about two years and have no real  triggers and I don't see myself at risk of relapse. That's not what this  is about, just background.

My boyfriend of a year now confessed to me in June that he believes  he has an eating disorder. His family has mocked his weight since he was  8 years old, forced him to go onto diets, etc. He still lives at home  and is constantly mocked for his weight and compared to his siblings.  But what baffles me is that he is not overweight. He would still be  perfect in my eyes if he was, I just don't understand where the comments  are coming from. I suppose he could be described as chubby but I  absolutely couldn't see him as overweight to any extreme amount. He has a  very distorted self image due to a lifetime of being mocked and shamed  by his family.

In June he told me that a few months before he'd started using a  calorie tracking app and it had spiraled out of control. He often eats  twice a day, at dinner and whatever he can find after midnight. It's  very obviously not enough as he's constantly feeling sick, bruising  easily, having memory issues and is exhausted most of the day. He's also  very depressed a lot of the time, sleeping about 14 hours a day,  isolating himself at times, etc. It hurts to watch him struggle and know  that there isn't anything I can really do. If he was anyone else I  would tell someone close to him that could help him, but I worry the  people he stays with would even encourage it.

He's self aware, knows it's harmful and says he just doesn't know how  to break the pattern. I offer advice (from my own experience and things  I read online) and support, compliment him on things unrelated to his  appearance unless comments on his body are welcomed. I'm doing  everything I can find to do and I know that he's been getting better  instead of worse, but it hurts so bad to watch him struggle in a similar  way I did.

He does see a therapist but he hasn't brought anything related to  this up.

Hi, I'm depressed and have been Having trouble with food which have caused me to lose quite a bit of weight.

I am never alone, and have come to the realisation that anyone even  being in the house deters me from eating. I have not eaten for more than  a week. I don't feel like I can ask my roommate to leave the house for  several hours, just so I might eat. I am a very slow eater, most likely  due to IBS, and a simple meal might take me an hour to consume. 

I have previously been a foodie, and always loved baking and cooking  so this is quite upsetting. I can't even get myself to use utensils, or  have anything that might smell and bother others.

326,EatingDisorders,"Hi everyone. I'll try to keep this short.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have an ED or am I just an attention seeking drama queen?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for a few months now and started taking medications mid July because therapy alone wasn't helping. (So far the medication doesn't seem to be working)

&amp;#x200B;

Since somewhere around the beginning of June (I think). I started losing my appetite and interest in food. This started getting worse and worse. It went from eating a bit less to eating a lot less to where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to eat anymore. I have no appetite and absolutely no interest in food or eating. Thinking about food makes me want to cry (I don't know why). When I do eat, it's very little. I also keep track of all the calories I consume and weigh myself everyday. I've lost about 37 pounds since mid June I think, but I was slightly overweight so I'm really happy with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is all my own fault because I keep telling myself I can't eat, that I have to lose weight and that I'm too fat. I feel like I'm an imposter. Maybe I'm just too lazy to cook, to go shopping, to eat? Maybe I'm not depressed and just incredibly lazy. I don't work out or do any kind of sport really. I sit or lie down a lot... Maybe I'm an attention seeker? Even posting this here feels like I'm looking for attention... But I just feel so hopeless.

327,EatingDisorders," 

Hi there, (I had to break my submission into 2 messages to meet the character limit. This is Part 1 of 2 for 1 post) A friend asked me for some advice for her sister who is currently struggling with her relationship to food and her body. I compiled the following information to pass along to her and thought it might be of service to this subreddit. I hope it brings some insight!

Here is a post I shared on social media a few years ago to summarize my journey:

I debated sharing this post for a long time so please read with an open heart and mind. For years, I hated and was very concerned about my body size and shape. I went on restrictive diets, religiously counted calories and steps, compulsively over-exercised, measured everything I ate, always ordered ridiculous substitutions at restaurants, and would often binge while drinking, stressed, or starving in secret. Even at my lowest weight (nutrient deficient, bones visible, hair loss), I still hated my body and thought I could be thinner. From then on, I almost always felt fat. It is possible to have an extremely distorted self image. It took me years to hit “diet rock bottom” where I knew I needed help and have since been on my recovery journey. At first, I was terrified to let myself eat whatever I wanted. I thought I’d never stop eating and could never trust my body to know what it needed. Learning to intuitively eat is a process but it is so well worth the effort! Having stabilized my weight near my natural “set point”, I am no longer constantly starving, obsessing over food/calories/workouts, and I am so much more in tune with what my body truly needs. Diets and health culture teach us to lose touch with our body’s innate wisdom. Disordered eating comes in many forms as eating struggles and body dysmorphia affect most people (Some stats say &gt;70% of us have some form of disordered eating) yet we seldom talk about it. The aim of this post is to share my story in hopes of helping others reexamine their relationships to food and body. I know how painful food struggles and body dissatisfaction can be and am now a huge advocate for self acceptance and rebellion against the weight loss/fitness industry and beauty ideal. We are so much more than our bodies. If any of this resonates with you, I highly suggest looking into the Food Psych Podcast, the book Intuitive Eating by Tribole/Resch, cleansing your Instagram of accounts that make you feel bad about yourself, and starting a journaling practice. \~\~\~\~

Additional reflections on what I've learned over the last 4+ years in Recovery: We live in a society that normalizes disordered eating. I used to think that either you have an eating disorder (i.e full blown anorexia or bulimia) or you are normal. When in reality, disordered eating exists on a spectrum. SO SO SO so many women (and increasingly more men) have disordered relationships to food and their body. We learn it from our mothers, friends, and the culture at large. Many women, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes have become aware of the constructed set of beliefs, norms, and practices that is referred to as “diet culture”. Examples of diet culture are: the idea that certain foods are “bad or good” or “clean or dirty” or the classic “vacation calories don’t count” or “I better be running xx miles tomorrow after this meal”, etc. The guilt and shame that is associated with allowing oneself to eat is one of the major effects of diet culture. Diet culture can be easily seen in fitness and weight loss industries but is also sneakily hidden in the general health and wellness industry. It’s a tricky realm to navigate because obviously we care about our health, but adopting diet culture’s norms and the “diet mentality” is ultimately detrimental to our health, even if it looks like making healthy choices in the short term. (More on this later.)

In order to heal from my own journey of disordered eating, chronic dieting, compulsive over exercising, and loathing my body, I dove deep into understanding the physical and psychological underworkings of my experience. It led to a massive perspective shift and profound learning around our current society, social norms, our biological needs, true self care, holistic health, and more. I have read multiple books on the topic and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcast interviews and stories with dietitians, nutritionists, psychologists, research scientists, social activists, and people in larger bodies who have been through astoundingly painful weight loss attempts and abuse from doctors/practitioners. But most importantly, I’ve lived it. I first handedly experienced the process of going from chronically dieting and hating my body to intuitively choosing foods that feel supportive in each moment, eating for the purpose of satisfaction and self care, and trusting and loving my body more than I could have ever imagined. I can confidently say that today, approximately 4.5 years after deciding I didn’t want to live my life obsessing over food, body concerns, and exercise, my relationship to food and my body is SO different. I never thought it could be so easeful and fulfilling. There is so much to learn but I can try to distill down some core facets that have really served my recovery.

**Intuitive eating:**

* This has been the most important resource for healing my relationship to food. The concept of intuitive eating was coined by 2 dietitians, and is outlined in a seminal book: Intuitive Eating, [https://www.intuitiveeating.org/](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/), the newest addition is now out and I fully recommend the accompanying workbook - Intuitive eating is a direct response to the failure of dieting. Ultimately, you’ll learn in the book that statistically speaking, diets don't work. They may deliver short term weight loss but the majority of people regain the initial weight plus MORE weight. Numerous studies have found that in general, diets result in long term weight GAIN rather than loss. This is because the body is protecting itself from famine. It’s a biological instinct to hold onto nutrients when they are restricted.
* Intuitive eating is how our bodies were designed. It’s based around identifying hunger and fullness cues, feeling into our cravings, desires, satisfaction, and practicing attunement and acceptance. It’s a practice so there will be times when you feel like you made a mistake (i.e. overeat and it will hurt, under eat and get way too hungry and maybe overeat), but that is where the acceptance part comes in. Practice self compassion, move on and try better next time! You're completely unlearning old diet behaviors/rules and learning a whole new way of living and being in your body. It takes time but it gets easier and easier and ultimately you don't even really have to think about it, it becomes so natural. Also, Intuitive Eating is not a tool for weight loss nor is it the ""hunger and fullness diet"" where you only are ""allowed"" to eat when hungry. THERE ARE NO RULES in intuitive eating. It is a personal practice based on developing an intimate relationship with your body.
* Trust is key. It’s really scary to trust your body at first. Especially if you’ve been in the diet mentality for a long time. Trust gets easier the more you practice it. And it’s so worth it.
* Binge/Restrict cycling: This was a major lightbulb for me. I used to restrict foods physically (e.g. restricting # of calories/day or avoiding sugar). Physical restriction triggers a biological craving for what is restricted. It’s within our DNA to avoid famine as was advantageous for so many of our ancestors to survive. Our bodies are created to sustain themselves. A diet is nothing more than a simulated famine. When certain food groups or nutrients in general are restricted, the body responds with intense cravings that ultimately result in binging. Out of control eating that feels scary, wrong, and shameful. My binge sessions were often triggered by stress or being drunk. Following a binge episode, we often then are very ashamed and freaked out about the amount consumed. This often leads to further restriction and the cycle continues. I lived this cycle for years.
* We can also restrict foods mentally. It’s a little trickier to understand but mental restriction is when you are telling yourself you “shouldn't” or “can’t” eat certain foods. The “good vs bad” and “clean vs dirty” food labeling are examples of mental restriction. Even if you are not physically restricting by outwardly being on a diet, mental restriction also can trigger the primal binge response. Our bodies are smarter than our minds. It’s against our biology to be denied nutrients, pleasure, and the social bonding of certain food rituals such as birthday cake or thanksgiving dinner.
* There is also the “last supper mentality” which is when you are planning to go on a diet (such as a no sugar diet or all veggie cleanse) but you have some time before starting. It’s common that your cravings will be out of control as your body tries to get as much of that food group in as it can before being restricted.
* Other Intuitive eating resources: Christy Harrison's Intuitive Eating Fundamentals Course (here), Isabel Foxen Duke's Stop Fighting Food (here), or the Fuck It Diet (here).

 

**Joyful Movement:** 

I used to approach movement as “working out” or “exercise”. Constantly counting my calories, distance, pace, and progress. In healing your relationship to food and body, it’s often recommended to reconsider your movement choices. I stopped running and doing pilates for 3+ years since those types of movement did not feel supportive for my healing. Instead, I explored ways of moving that truly felt good in my body and I approached them with no expectations of caloric exertion, etc. - Yoga, rock climbing, nature walks, and tribal fusion belly dancing are all forms of movement that make me feel embodied, joyful, and mentally refreshed. My body feels celebrated instead of punished. I also approach movement intuitively, and never force myself to do any type or amount of movement that doesn’t feel like it will serve me. I embrace rest, especially on certain days of my monthly cycle, and I feel so much more in tune with my body's needs. - There have been challenging moments where life gets so busy that there is no/little time for joyful movement. These are times when my recovery is challenged and I get to deepen my practice of acceptance, trust, and letting go of expectations. Life is very cyclical and there will always be time to regularly move again. Time for movement is a privilege that so many people do not have. I’m so grateful when time allows for joyful movement but I do not punish myself or feel guilty when I do not have the time.

**Body Image:**  


* Health at Every Size:
   * Health at Every Size (HAES) is a newly emerging concept with substantial scientific evidence to support it. In short, it is the idea that one’s body size does not indicate one’s health. Or rather, that people in larger bodies can be completely healthy even if considered “overweight”. Or that thinner does not necessarily equal healthier. (This is not to say that all people in larger bodies are healthy). You can learn about HAES at the website (here).
* It's virtually impossible to live in western society without some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in healing. Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a ""negative body image thought"" and respond with something like ""I am not my body"" or ""my body does not define me"" or ""my body is my vessel"" or ""the shape of my body does not matter"" or ""all bodies are worthy of love""... I’d recommend finding some little mantras that resonate with you. Try following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes, influencers, etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less fat-phobic.
* We live in a society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear being ""fat"" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products, beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self hatred that they instill within us - It's truly evil. We must remember that ""modern"" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the full feminine form as a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is. Journaling down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!

&amp;#x200B;

**Self care practices:**  


* Healing from having a disordered relationship to food and body is so much more than just addressing the food and body relationship. There is almost always an underlying issue or set of issues that is driving the disordered behaviors. Yes, living in diet culture and fatphobia are main factors, but other factors contribute significantly. Some examples of underlying causes are: trauma (emotional, physical, etc.), unworthiness, low self esteem, perfectionism, needing to have control, escapism, self harm, etc.
* For me, my disordered eating was caused by low self esteem, unworthiness, perfectionism, and the need to have control. When life gets stressful and overwhelming, it’s an instinct to grasp for control of something. Controlling one's food and body is an accessible option. - Prioritizing self care practices that support us is key! Ways to healthily manage stress, overcome trauma, heal unworthiness wounds, and increase self love and self acceptance are CRUCIAL to healing the root causes. Joyful movement is one of these practices but others are: journaling, talk therapy, art therapy, women's circles, reading, dance, yoga, singing, sound healing, reiki, acupuncture, creativity (art, writing, etc). A book that is often recommended is the Artist's Way. One of the practices in the book is a 30 minute journaling session first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness, brain dump on to paper. This was amazingly transformative for me. My writing sessions often consisted of me unpacking my stresses and body concerns, and reassuring myself with positive affirmations.
* So I highly recommend journaling! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore other creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!

&amp;#x200B;

I started dating a guy a month ago. Back then, I felt in a more stable position and thought my eating behaviours were controlled (later realized it was just in my mind and I was actually starving myself while exercising to exhaustion). Since dating him, I felt some weird pressure that I'm not good enough and my self-esteem got even worse. He lets his emotions mostly inside and isn't really affectionate yet (rlly introverted). I'm okay with it, but because of that, I'm always second-guessing myself. I started binging and purging a lot and can't seem to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out for help and I'm going to a psychologist in less than 2 months. I opened to him about it through text and texted him if he wants to rethink if dating me was a good idea, I would understand. He wants to stay in a relationship and also said it would be harder for me if we weren't together... after texting him how bad my situation is, he mentioned he wants to get more intimate, but since my ED is so bad, I have no idea what to do. He is so laid-back, that means I need to push this relationship forward because he wants to. Yet, I can't help but avoid calling him out because I gained weight while trying to recover by myself (ended horribly). I'm afraid of losing him too because I destroyed most of my other relationships because of avoidance, I'm really really lonely and alone at this point in life (will be even more without him)💀 Tysm for reading this far I appreciate it a lot ❤️",,Request: ED and dating trouble,4,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,oz3i56,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oz3i56/request_ed_and_dating_trouble/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oz3i56/request_ed_and_dating_trouble/,1628243388,302,0,0,0,-1,1,Pressure from a new relationship causing increased negative self-esteem and exacerbating binge-purge cycle,harmful,"Increased binge-purge behavior since the start of the new relationship, Fear of losing the relationship and being alone, Seeking help from a psychologist in less than 2 months",Dating someone who puts pressure on her self-esteem and triggers her eating disorder,harmful,"Experiencing increased binging and purging, Feeling pressure to push the relationship forward even though her ED is worsening, Fear of losing the relationship and being alone",Dating someone who triggers low self-esteem and pressure to be good enough,harmful,"Increased binging and purging behaviors, Fear of losing the relationship and becoming even more lonely"
329,EatingDisorders,"I recently sought help for an ED, and have been referred by my GP onto specialists. My issue is that my GP strongly recommends I tell my parents, because currently they have no clue I've been going through this. I am terrified of telling them, because I feel like they're going to try help me but ultimately make things worse. This is exactly what happened when I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago: their way of helping me was to belittle my issues e.g. ""you only have minor depression \[I didn't\], why are you acting so miserable?"" Or by reminding me of the damage I was causing my loved ones like saying ""you're selfish, cruel and tearing this family apart."" In the past I've confronted them about how what they said to me was really upsetting, but they always reply with how they were never taught what to do when their kid is depressed and ultimately never change how they speak to me. We have an extremely strained relationship, but I think they deserve to know what's happening. I just don't feel safe telling them whilst I'm living at home. My plan was to call them over the phone once I'd moved back to university, but at the same time I feel like the issue deserves a face to face conversation. They will probably find out one way or another, they already comment on how much weight I've lost, and that I never eat with them. At the moment they've just assumed I hate them and don't want to eat at meal times with them, and because I'm scared of telling them the truth I've let them believe that. I'm just terrified they're going to get upset and concerned, and proceed to try to force me to eat by yelling at me etc. which would just cause me unbelievable distress in a time when I'm already emotionally fragile.

330,EatingDisorders,"I (27) have had issues with a combination of binging, purging, and sometimes purposely starving myself since I was 13. I have never openly told anyone until recently but am at a lose as to what to do. I haven’t ever really had the time to worry about it, since other things were mostly my first priority. My Schizophrenia took up most of my teenage and young adult life and most days are hard enough with that but I’ve finally come to terms with how serious this can be. My ED seemed to be under what I would like to call control for awhile until recently. I’ve realized that since I don’t have much control over my mind and what goes on it I try to take control over other aspects of my life that I can, which is where the ED comes in. I’m sorry if I am using any wrong terms, I’m really new into understanding why I do this and even more into what it even was at first.

331,EatingDisorders,"Hello. I am a very picky eater, a word that I hate to use due to often being infantilized or used to refer to children despite being an adult with what seems to be a very serious issue. I have researched and while there seems to be an ED which may fit what i'm experiencing, my situation is not that extreme as the symptoms described in that ED, at least I don't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have what seems to be severe depression and body issues, I am not diagnosed hence it's not clear to me. I hate most food, be it taste or texture, and refuse to eat it no matter what. I can cook very little because I have no experience and am afraid to learn how to cook due to my living situation (unrelated). Since the pandemic I have gained weight, and cannot afford much take-out food if it's not cheap, which usually ends up being fast food. I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how I look, I always feel fat, and saying I hate myself is an understatement. Yet when I think it's all mostly because I am a ""picky eater"" it makes me feel disgusted. I feel like a child. I feel massive anxiety around food if it's not something simple like rice, plain pasta, or other basic foods like that. I cannot tolerate seafood, nor most greens. Seeing any spices on my food makes me spiral because I won't know what it is and the thought of it changing the taste or texture of the food disgusts me. It makes me feel rude whenever I order out and it makes me feel like I'm wasting food if someone else is cooking for me, and in both cases it feels like im wasting money, and it would be easier for me to shut up and starve. Growing up I was always judged and picked on, punished and shouted at for not eating certain foods.

ED or not. Trigger warning: vomit, eating disorder. So, I’m 20 years of age and for the last 18 months I’ve been dealing with loss of appetite. I’ve been “slim” “skinny” my whole life so food has never been an issue for me. But last year I gained a bit of weight, it went to face and i hated it. I don’t remember exactly how or what happened after but I was back to my old weight again and i was happy. I didn’t think anything of it but now my psychologist is concerned that i may have ED. Im going days without food, living only on a mini sausage roll. Sometimes I wonder how I’m able to go to work. In the past when things were really bad, i experienced major hunger pains, chest pains, shortness of breathe and stomach aches. I didn’t think they correlated. I was starving. I was so hungry but every time I put food in my mouth I would feel sick to my stomach. I love food and I thought it was just stress but it comes and goes, that undesirable feeling to eat. I want to eat but every time I do there’s this voice in my head double checking if I’m enjoying the food, double checking if I’m sure I don’t want to vomit. And then I run to the toilet. It’s the worst. I hate it. I’m underweight and I just want to get better. I’ve lost x kg in three weeks. I don’t purge, I don’t count calories or anything. I don’t like sweets, I hate sugar and won’t have anything overly sweet or with a high sugar intake including natural sweets like banana, but isn’t that normal? I just want to know what you guys think because I’m going crazy trying to rationalise everything. I’ve seen my doctor about it, we ran tests but somehow everything came back fine, my blood levels were abnormal but everything was okay. That was three weeks ago. Now I’ve lost x kg (like I’ve said) and I’m so sad about it. I thought everything was okay. I don’t know how this happened. There are good days where I eat okay and other days I sleep with nothing because of that voice. Im afraid to gain weight, I wouldn’t want to be big. I like how I am.

Back in high school, grade 12 I started my ""weightloss"" journey since I felt like I had gotten ""too big"" just for context I was a Volleyball athlete who loved to powerlift/lift(started when I was a kid) loved food was happy had no issues. I dont want to go into to much context since I do feel like it would be triggering, but long story short I developed an ed and struggle for about 4 years before I finally gave into to seek help. 

I was lucky enough to get into an ed program at the hospital where I'm from. I had completed the program and felt my diet mentally, how I viewed food, bp, over exercising etc... was in a way in control. 

Im 22 years old.Past few months I've come to realize that my ed has come back, how I view food and how I perpusly underrate, what are good and bad foods, tracking macros and purging. I just feel ashamed, lost, depressed, stressed, overwhelmed, scared and so much more and just dont want it to get as bad as what it used to be. I'm sorry if my text is kinda everywhere and doesn't make sense just figured I'd give it a try without adding everything that I've gone and been going through aha If you guys could help me send me onto the right path with any of your tips and tricks, advice or just anything really that would be amazing

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with food has always been normal before,I’ve always been skinny and everyone else in my family is too so I never felt like I needed to worry about food or what I ate since I never gained anything anyways.Around January I started feeling like I wasn’t skinny enough yet and like I could lose a small amount of weight to be at this specific goal weight which I was obsessed with for no real [reason.It](https://reason.It) started small with me just cutting out snacks but over the past couple of months it has spiraled into:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Counting calories/weighing everything I eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-Doing 2-3 workouts a day and feeling fat/like iam gaining weight when I skip a day

&amp;#x200B;

\-intermittent fasting,having specific times for when I can eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-binge episodes

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have tried purging a couple of times but it didn’t work so I use lax tea after I binge/feel like I ate too much

&amp;#x200B;

\-cutting food in small pieces,eating out of small plates while using small utensils to make the food last longer -feeling extra safe when eating a lot of fruit and vegetables

&amp;#x200B;

\-getting angry/upset/scared when someone forces me to eat something I don’t want to eat or didn’t plan on eating/I have to eat at a family event and don’t know what’s in the food,iam hanging out with friends and seeing them get my trigger foods (fear of losing control and binging on said foods)

&amp;#x200B;

\-having a specific calorie limit and feeling terrible and like iam going to gain weight if I get over that limit -being scared of weighing myself -Having meals planned out in my head -when something bad happens I automatically think about starving myself

&amp;#x200B;

I only weighed myself this month because I had to before my wisdom teeth removal surgery and turns out iam underweight now which makes me oddly proud but at the same time I still can’t believe it because I feel like I don’t look that different and because nobody has told me I look skinnier yet (could be because I’ve always been skinny already but it still upsets me)I feel like I maybe have to loose a bit more because for some reason I really want people to tell me that they see a difference or even that I look unhealthy.

Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem I'm not sure how to handle. My friend has gained a lot of weight during the COVID-19 situation and wants to lose weight because they're overweight now and don't feel happy about the way they look. That's okay of course, but their attitude towards eating, losing weight and their self image lately has been worrying to me. They obsess over their intake and they're very insecure about their body. We both think they're going through a bad period mental health wise and they're projecting it on losing weight. Yesterday, they felt bad about something else and also felt like they had to much to eat, so they purged. This scared me shitless. They say they regret it and don't want to do it again and that they know where their behavior stems from, but I said that's what a lot of people think and say before developing an eating disorder. I recognize a lot of red flags in their behavior and I really want to help them and prevent the development of an eating disorder. What's something I could do to help push them in the right direction?

I have a history of disordered eating - was diagnosed  two years ago with anorexia by one therapist and atypical anorexia by  another therapist. I never followed through with therapy, but was able  to recover on my own (stopped calorie counting, restricting, and over  exercising in February of last year). My cardiologist wanted me to gain  weight since my low body fat percentage was affecting my heart, which  was a big reason why I decided to change what I was doing.

My husband and I became pregnant with our second child in December -  it was a challenging pregnancy with many complications. She was born  several months early and is finally home from the NICU. I am diagnosed  with severe postpartum depression and anxiety, which I’m sure a lot has  to do with the traumatic NICU experience. I started taking Lexapro a  week and a half ago, and am finally having some better periods of time. 

The issue is that I’m still not eating - I don’t get hungry (when my  stress is high I’m not hungry, it’s always been that way). But it’s  almost been a month since having my baby and she’s finally home and  healthy, yet I still can’t eat. The thought of eating when I’m not  hungry gives me anxiety. 

I have been in contact with the social worker and am waiting to hear  back from the psychiatrist, I just don’t know if this is just depression  or the eating disorder showing itself again.

I’m 16 years old and a female and I struggled with  restriction from october2020-january2021. I finally decided to pull my  self out of it. I worked really hard to recover and I did it on my own  using online resources and creators and such. I still have a lot of bad  stuff from that period. I feel like I did not really suffer or have an  ED though because I was undiagnosed and nobody noticed and I did not  become severely underweight. I feel like I’m making it up.

I don't know if I'm in the right place but it seemed as good as any

I'm having a little bit of trouble, I wouldn't go ahead and say I am  dealing with an ED right away because in all my Googling I couldn't find  any that seemed to define this... so may be it isn't? But I feel as  though I am on the way to one. I'm sorry for the ramble, I'm confused  and nervous. I haven't put this into words ever before I am in my early 20s, I have hyperthyroid. It's under control now. But I  am still underweight. Not by a lot, but a bit. Enough to be noticed and  enough to constantly hear about how I am so skinny, I am only skin and  bones, etc etc. It's frustrating to keep hearing it, but at the same  time I am terrified for myself because I do not feel strong because I'm  skinny. I don't know if that's a thing actually I am obsessed with gaining weight, to be ""curvier"". Like I am changing  my diet every two days because it ""isn't working"" in helping me put some  on. I feel sick if I haven't eaten, I feel nauseous if I'm eating more  than I can (overeating I guess), but I don't see progress and it is  winding me up all the time. My digestive health has gone for a toss, my  skin is always feeling sensitive/tender and I've never had breakouts on  my face before but I've recently been breaking out a little bit too I don't know what the problem is, I don't know if it's classified as an  ED. But it is making me gradually increasing obsessed with what I'm  eating and counting calories to be in a ""surplus"" and it's driving me  nuts

Hello, I am currently about to go into either an IOP or PHP program  to treat my anorexia, but it is virtual because of the pandemic. I was  really looking forward to going out and getting to be in a healthier  space, because I currently live in the home of my childhood abuse (which  is mentally wearing me down, and contributing to my ED) with someone  who is very triggering regarding food. I really, really, needed to get  out of the house and I cannot afford to move. I am incredibly stressed  and also dealing with CPTSD.

I am worried that doing an intensive outpatient program or similar  while still in my home environment will be completely counterintuitive,  and might not help at all. I cannot imagine trying to develop a healthy  relationship with food in my home, under this stress and with someone so  triggering. Has anyone experienced something similar, and did your  virtual treatment work? Or does anyone have tips for going forward?  Thank you so much.

346,EatingDisorders,"Hi, I’ve never posted here before so I hope this is not triggering but I was hoping to receive some advice as I don’t know anyone who has ever dealt with an ED irl. I’m a 21 year old guy from the UK and from my early teenage years to late teenage years I suffered with a restrictive ED and was consistently very underweight. Through a series of significant events including a loved one becoming very ill, a death, meeting my partner and quitting smoking &amp; drugs my ED seemed to no longer be an issue in the latter half of 2019 and I gained a little bit of weight to put me on the lower end of a healthy weight . I wasn’t thrilled but it didn’t bother me like I know it would have before, anyway, 2020 was a shitshow of course with the lockdowns, I got put on Citalopram then sertraline and by early 2021 I entered the lower end of overweight. I wasn’t thrilled at this but the meds allowed me to not care. 

Fast forward to April 2021, im off the meds and suddenly it all hits me. I decided I wanted to lose it in a healthy way so fast forward to now, I’m back to the lower end of a healthy weight. Things should be great right ? Well not so much. As I wanted to get back to my pre-lockdown weight as fast as possible I’ve had a v strict routine, but I still felt like I was being healthy as it wasn’t as restrictive as when I was a teenager, however now it’s time to relax, eat more and just maintain my weight im finding it impossible. For the first time in 3 months I tried to eat food that wasn’t super plain or healthy and would make me exceed my daily allowance and I didn’t sleep and I stayed up all night panicking from the shame, im so anxious about the scale going up as I’ve been weighing myself everyday the past 3 months. I’m glad im back to a healthy weight but trying to now not eat in a deficit is triggering me like crazy, i also am not thrilled about the physical results, 3 months ago I couldn’t look in the mirror, I can look now which is an improvement but I’m not satisfied still, I look like how I looked before lockdown which was the goal originally but I don’t feel able to stop, i thought I just had a good discipline this past months and was motivated to be healthy but now I’m wondering if my old behaviours are creeping back .

347,EatingDisorders,"I just got put on an exchange meal plan by my dietician and I feel like trying to attempt recovery while still having to follow rigid food rules is so counterintuitive and requires me to spend just as much time thinking &amp; obsessing about food and limiting my food choices as restricting did. Like I am still having to measure my food and weigh my proteins, I have to essentially count macros to meet my exchange goals for every meal, I have to plan out everything in advance instead of just eating what feels/sounds good.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten.

My sister has always been a heavier person than others, this wouldn't be a problem but lately she has been eating so much fastfood and sweets, an average day would consist of not eating breakfast, heading to work, eating a burger and an iced coffee then heading off to a restaurant to eat more, and she knows that all of this food is hurting her but she doesn't try to change anything and i believe she might be depressed, her room is always a mess and she is always sleeping, on top of that any time she talks to people about her life she always talks down on herself and makes it seem uninteresting, of course this is all me just hypothesising but it seems like she treats food as an escape or a way to get instant satisfaction.

350,EatingDisorders,"Hi, I’m trying to promote better bowel movements for myself as I’m chronically constipated.

353,EatingDisorders,"Hi guys, I have been wanting to compile this for a while now &amp; today felt right. 

Brief background, I was diagnosed with anorexia for 4 years, then binge-eating disorder for 1 year, and began attempting recovery in 2017 while struggling with flip-flopping to both sides of the spectrum. 7 years total of major depression and other related mental health issues prior to 2017. I am currently 20 years old. 2017: 

1. How to stop binge-eating?? First focused on awareness mid-bingeing that I wanted to stop. I realized I would go mentally numb and binge-eating was a coping mechanism for my stress. I wrote myself a letter the morning after a binge, describing every detail, telling future me why it didn't help, how awful my body felt, and that I could do better for myself. I still read this from time-to-time today. Discovered I felt like I was intrinsically-worthless, but did not yet make a connection that the false belief contributed to my binges. 

2. I always had a journal my entire life and realized I only ever journaled the negative things in my life. I made my first attempts at jotting down positive things as well. 2018: First time I went to therapy. Realized anorexia &amp; binge-eating both had to do with control. I turned to not eating to feel in control when everything else was crazy, and binged when life was too painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized several very important things that made this year a turning point: 

1. I allowed myself to be alone and feel pain alone. I previously used food to avoid facing my emotions. 

2. Food-focus was a coping mechanism. I brain-stormed on paper a list of 50+ other possible coping mechanisms for stress and picked a few that I loved: meditating, drinking sparkling water, reading, going for walks, taking hot showers, reaching out to a friend, working out. 

3. I learned it was important to give names to what I was avoiding: discovered that being sxually abused as a child was what triggered my initial disordered eating. I had refused to face it for years &amp; through professional help, finally began processing what happened to me, instead of avoiding it with food control or binges. I identified my disorder as something inside of me, not actually \~me\~. 

4. Facing a very invasive surgery (unrelated to my ed) I discovered the power of meditation with self-awareness and anxiety. The best way for me was to visualize that I was a tree &amp; my thoughts were the birds around it. I am not my thoughts. I am a being. First discovered the experience of being fully present, with short 5-minute meditations where I just allowed myself to be aware of all my thoughts, sitting cross-legged in a quiet room on the floor with my eyes closed. 

2019: Had a few relapses from challenging life events, but learned a lot. 

1. First learned how to forgive myself even if others were still hurting. 

2. Learned about boundaries in therapy. I either had stringent boundaries or very weak boundaries and almost nothing in-between. 

3. Began learning how to be more open about my issues &amp; chose people to confide in \*VERY critical to the next steps of healing in the next 2 years, although it seemed unrelated. This was the year I began to build my ""support group"". I had no one to confide in previously. 10/10 highly recommend first focus on finding 1 person you can trust with your journey. 

4. Learned about Guilt vs. Shame: my therapist recommended TED Talk ""Listening to Shame"" by Brene Brown on YouTube, it CHANGED my life. I realized I struggled with shame, not guilt, &amp; began to make distinctions between the two &amp; reframe how I felt about myself. 

2020: Huge accomplishment: Achieved my first 6 months at a healthy weight that I felt beautiful at, w/o fluctuating up &amp; down significantly! Really began developing a sense of when it's ok to eat &amp; when to stop. Had 1 more major relapse. 

1. I read the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"": just the 1st 2 chapters was enough to realize how deeply embedded our childhood is in all of us. HIGHLY recommend. Gave me further power over my deep pain &amp; ability to separate desire to eat/avoid eating with desire to not feel pain. Realized I could be in control if I wanted. 

2. Did a 30-day challenge called ""Beating Binge Eating"": learned a TON, highly recommend. For me specifically, learned I had a lot of bad habits with control. I not only controlled food, but tried to control everything else too. I attempted a more holistic approach, identified things (like my family) that I gave too much power to, &amp; began to focus more on me through ""self-care"". -Important Take-aways from this challenge: Even tho my over-eating was not as calorically large as it used to be, it was still compulsive and therefore a binge. I now label any compulsive eating as a binge, because naming it gives me power over it. I would often spend 20 minutes in Walmart picking the perfect calorie/flavor/type of ice cream &amp; realized I did this with a lot of foods, and ordering in restaurants. I gave myself a time limit to decide on food--because, after all, it's just food. Also made 2 new rules on my weekly food-shopping: (1) if I saw a food I liked 2 weeks in a row &amp; still wanted it, then I got it the 3rd time I saw it. (2) every week I bought myself at least 1 treat, no matter what. This allowed me to discover I could in fact have treats &amp; not binge on it, because I knew I would be getting more the next week no matter what, &amp; helped heal some scarcity mindset. 

3. Self-Care: Watched ""AlexandrasGirlyTalk"" Youtube video on How To Self Care. Applied it to my life: scheduled in showers, researched best soaps/makeup/ways to make myself feel good in ways other than food to decrease my stress. For the first time ever, dedicated a couple hours a week to relaxing, even if it felt selfish or like I should be doing other more ""important"" busy-work. Really learned how to connect with myself &amp; truly feel, cry, &amp; not be numb. 

. Attended EMDR therapy for my trauma&amp; began learning how to re-file everything. HIGHLY recommend therapy in general. By FAR the biggest contributor to my healing. I saw 5 total therapists in 2 years ranging from eating disorders, general therapy, and EMDR. It's OK if it takes a couple tries before you find one that you work well with. 

2021: I moved 1300 miles away from my hometown &amp; got a new clarity on what I want in life. 

1. I read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fck"": Realized I cared too much about what my family/everyone thought of me. Fully accepted it’s OK to take a break from communication with toxic people &amp; am currently still on that break to connect with what I want. I had also assumed being a certain weight added value to my life. I was wrong. 

2. I read the reddit post ""How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide For Those Who Struggle"": The phrase ""Bruh, it's just food"" stuck out to me. I’m learning to identify that the only thing a binge/over-eating does is satisfy the urge to binge. I gave it too much control/importance because of how I initially abused it as a child for a false sense of control. I will literally chant ""Bruh, it's just food"" in my head when I feel compulsive, &amp; most times I say it until my heartrate slows down, I believe it, &amp; I can simply move on with my day. Sometimes I fail (aka obsess over food for way longer than I like) &amp; that's OK too. 

3. Discovered I needed to Fail: one day I walked to the gym, stayed for 1 minute, &amp; walked back--shocked when I was in tears with sudden urges to binge &amp; couldn't get it together for a while. My whole life I told myself I can ""fail"" but never believed it &amp; always punished myself after without being aware of it. New way of thinking I am attempting now: If I don't want to do something, I will attempt it for 5 minutes and then stop if I still don't want to. Then actually allow myself to stop after 5 minutes without creating any consequences for myself. Still learning how to do this, but it’s incredibly freeing &amp; allows me to enjoy a large meal and move on with my amazing day. Or take a day off from a heavy lifting routine in the gym &amp; play videogames instead w/o beating myself up for being ""lazy"". 

4. New eating goal: I eat until my hunger signals go away, not eat until I am completely full for hours. Still learning to do this, but it leaves me free to eat enjoyable food when I want &amp; look forward to more later. 

5. Discovered I still struggled with feeling intrinsically worthless. To combat this, I began to put my worth in a higher power, Jesus. Yes this is specific to my religion, but my whole life I tried to get my worth from what I do for other people, &amp; how they perceive me. I realized this will always be lacking &amp; needed to choose something somewhat arbitrary for my mind to latch onto, something that will never change, so even if the people around me are not treating me well, I know I don’t need their validation to be allowed to live a full life. This has helped me ease desires of food coping mechanisms, &amp; instead believe I am not intrinsically dirty just by the fact that I exist &amp; am already loved by someone/something beyond us. 

I'd love to hear what others have used for combatting feelings like this too! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but this is the only thing that has truly impacted my life at its worst. Overall, I realized my eating disorders had almost nothing to do with food. It was the most convenient coping mechanism at the time, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong or dirty about me because I still obsessively think about food sometimes. There is SO much more to life than food. My journey needed a much more holistic approach than just focusing on food... so hope this helps someone else too. If you're at this point or beyond, what have you learned? How do you lose the desire to eat once you are full/move on with your day? Do you obsess sometimes still, or eventually it went away for you completely?

355,EatingDisorders," 

Hi everyone, looking for advice on how to avoid slipping backwards and being triggered by weight loss/gain. I had a fall a couple of months ago, and was severely concussed, i was also prescribed a new medication for epilepsy that can be an appetite suppressant. Whatever the reason, I lost my appetite completely and barely ate. I was not previously overweight, but on the high side of normal for my height, and lost weight to the point where I am now on the low side of normal. When I was in my teens my eating was quite disordered, I would purposefully skip meals and make myself sick, was obsessed with numbers and Convinced I was overweight, would binge eat or purposely eat junk food because I knew exactly how many calories were in things (e.g eating 2 kitkats all day because in my head it was better than eating an actual meal since I knew the numbers). Anyway I consider myself to have recovered quite well from this over the past 10 years, don’t own a scales now and basically until this accident, was fairly unrestricted (I only know my weight because they took it in hospital when I fell, and I went to the doctors today). However, having lost weight, I feel once again obsessed with losing weight. I haven’t felt this feeling for years, it feels like I got a buzz from losing weight and thinking I was going to be eating tiny amounts and losing more and more weight forever. I feel overwhelmed by eating normally again and depressed at the idea of gaining the weight back. People have been commenting that I don’t look good, but I love the feeling of my clothes being too big. I have a normal appetite but have been telling people I don’t and feeling guilty when I do eat normal amounts. I ate a normal breakfast this morning (cornflakes and a fruit salad, defo not binging) and made myself sick after. I’m feeling stressed and low about my epilepsy diagnosis and having bad headaches, and I’m scared I’m vulnerable to this getting a lot worse. Please help.

359,EatingDisorders,"Hello, I'm absolutely desperate right now and I have no idea what to do and if anything can help me. I'm 24M from the UK, and I've been a long time sufferer of anxiety. Throughout most of my life, I've been able to control it, but about 5 years ago, it came back in full force and completely devastated me. I went from studying and uni to never leaving my home and, sometimes even my room, and feeling completely anxious all of the time. After a few years, I managed to get it under control to a certain extent. I still wasn't leaving the house much, but I had routine and functioned at a basic level. Last year was probably the best year I've had recently. I started going out more. My life wasn't free from anxiety, but I felt its control waning and I could finally see a future for myself. This all ended a few months ago when seemingly out of nowhere, it came back again. At first is was a panic attack here, a panic attack there, but as the weeks and months progressed, a chipped away at me. I tried to fight it. I tried to maintain my progress that I'd worked so hard to obtain, but it was futile. I withdrew more and more, slowly limiting my life more and more, and now I'm in the worst state I've ever been in.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my anxiety told hold fully 5 years ago, I've had a difficult relationship with food. My anxiety destroys my appetite and makes me feel incredibly nauseous (it almost feels like someone is sticking their fingers down my throat), but for the most part, I've managed to push through it, but now I can't even do that. I feel so bad almost all day. Constant nausea and anxiety. I feel completely detached from reality. Nothing feels real, so it feels impossible to ground myself in anything. I can't feel present because I don't know where I am. I feel like I'm stuck in a dream/nightmare state and I can't wake up. I know I need to eat and this just makes me more anxious and nauseous. I am really scared that I'm going insane and it's killing/going to kill me. Yesterday, I managed a banana, some peanuts, a small bowl of salad, a slice of bread and a cheese sandwich. Today, I've only managed a banana and a handful of nuts. This is about what I managed the other day when I had a really bad episode of hypoglycaemia, where I almost passed out. It felt like my insides were collapsing and is the worst I've ever felt in my life, and I'm still shaken by it and terrified of it happening again. The less I eat, the worse I feel, and the worse I feel, the less I eat. It feels endless. To make things even worse, we're experiencing a heatwave at the moment and I also have an ulcer on my uvula, which developed about a week ago, so eating has just felt like a herculean feat. It's painful and incredibly distressing, and it occupies my thoughts almost constantly. I've shrugged off labelling my eating problems as an eating disorder, as it's not associated with body image problems etc., but my eating and relationship with food is very disorder, so would it count?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not just food, but washing and brushing my teeth etc. has become a real challenge. My nausea is so bad that I can't physically talk to anyone either, as doing so makes me feel like I'm going to gag. I feel utterly trapped and know I need help, but I don't know what to do. I already take mirtazapine 30mg at night, which sometimes helps my appetite, and I was prescribed 2mg of Diazepam, which I've taken twice recently. It seemed to help a bit, but I'm terrified of the long term problems associated with it. Sorry for this barely coherent essay, but I'm completely lost right now.

My doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.

This has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Before breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake.

The idea of putting on any kind of weight scares the shit out of me, and in the few days I've been on this plan, I've been absolutely miserable and plagued with depression and overthinking every single time I eat. I'm going to call a therapist and try and seek help with this, but I know I can only meet with them for an hour... I'm worried about the times I'm alone with myself and my thoughts.

365,EatingDisorders,"So I'm on my period right now and I feel crap anyways and I just want to cry. I suffer badly with extreme period pain and have to take codeine to even get through my periods laying in bed and even then the pain drives me to sickness. This stops me from loosing weight and its fucking upsetting. I want a baby desperately which is why I suffer the pain of my periods every month but I've had four miscarriages now.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm obese after loosing a baby at 16 weeks last year and never shifting the baby weight and also after taking a multitude of antidepressants last year to try and feel some semblance of normal, most of them made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight on top of the weight I had already put on and I've lost control of my eating disorder once again.

&amp;#x200B;

As a teen I struggled with anorexia and bulimia and I suppose it would be covered under the blanket term 'eating disorder not otherwise specified' or 'EDNOS' for short. I'm 20 now and I've gone the other end with binge eating disorder and general emotional eating. I have never had a healthy relationship with food. I want to loose weight desperately because I'm sick of being large, I have issues with my knees, hips and ankles and always have and being overweight has only worsened that. My biggest issue is that exercising and calorie counting genuinely triggers me just thinking about it. In the past during attempts to loose weight I have fallen back into a pattern of exercising in secret, under eating and all my old tricks I don't care to include here. In fact it was emotional eating for 8 months then suddenly trying to cut out food entirely that made me balloon multiple dress sizes years ago that left me 'plus size' in the first place. I honestly went up about 3 dress sizes in a week and haven't gone down since I stayed consistent for years at that size fluctuating a little within it and now I've gone up a size again. It's made such a huge difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just fed up because thinking about how skinny I was makes me want to vomit and it's a bad habit I want to cut from my life. My eating disorders started because of my mum calling me fat and my peers calling me fat purely because my thighs jiggled and I had large breasts. Even at my skinniest I had double D's (UK size if you're curious).

I just want to be able to loose weight without falling into disordered eating and pro-ED behaviours.

I've searched this a bit and only find things that are the opposite. I'll be hungry and go to eat and I look in the fridge and see things, but immediately think about how it would be a waste for me to eat it and that it'll be a waste if I eat it because my roommate then won't be able to eat it or she won't be able to use it to cook dinner. I'll get really anxious and then won't eat at all because I feel I shouldn't eat anything that others may want.

I’ve (16F) been suffering from an ED for about a year and a half now. This is a restrictive eating disorder, which I became aware of perhaps five months into having it. I have conflicting ‘diagnoses’ if they can be called that— my pediatrician thinks I have anorexia and my therapist thinks I have AFRID. I think I have orthorexia. What began as a desire for health devolved into a full-blown eating disorder. I was severely underweight and understood the health consequences but couldn’t bring myself to care. I was content with slowly losing myself.

My parents grew concerned. I was admitted for blood work and heart scans in April, and when the results came back showing deficiencies and abnormal heart activity, I had a private call with my doctor. This was the first time I admitted aloud that I had an eating disorder. I cried and lied but was honest enough to get some truth out. My doctor prescribed me fluoxetine, an antidepressant, based off of a twenty minute phone call. This unnerved me. I was scared of being reliant on medication and decided to hold off on taking it, to see how my mood would change on its own as recovery was forced on me (I was briefly hospitalized and am being closely monitored by my parents and pediatrician as my weight is restored).

Sometimes I feel okay now. My obsessive thoughts have lessened and I’ve been able to be somewhat candid in therapy. I don’t feel overwhelmed with guilt for eating much anymore, though I still restrict in some ways. Food is less of a fixation than it used to be, albeit a fixation still.

But I don’t feel much better. I am a creative person. I adore writing, reading, and drawing and gaming as a side hobby, but lately I’ve had no interest in it. No interest in anything. No hopes or aspirations for the future. No will to live, frankly. I know these are symptoms of depression. I’m wondering if I should give fluoxetine a try. My cousin was on antidepressants for some time, though, and, as is the nature of an ED, I’m scared of the weight gain they tend to cause as well as becoming reliant on medication. I want so badly to do this on my own.

369,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I'm male 40+ with a lifelong struggle with eating. I've spent years seemingly bulimic and years seemingly anorexic. Mostly, though, the common thread seems to be some sort of OCD self soothing that's happening. My weight has never been healthy but it's now severely out of control and I think it's beyond me to help myself. I've done all the things I can think of and eating is really strikingly something I must do vs want to do. It's been causing sexuality issues for 25+ years, has been caused by or contributed to severe body and gender dysmorphia feelings. Im mentally ok, but I am not and have not been living anything like a sustainable life. I just can't do things I should be a me to do.. need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

So:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for anyone here to help diagnose what's happening....but where do I start? All of the above is self-diagnosing and I would much rather work out with a professional what is actually happening. I live in a very remote, very rural area and my PCP is probably not someone I can go to productively. I need contacts online . What are good resources? What do I look for?

&amp;#x200B;

Second question is: I've been sort of fantasizing about being locked up lately and just detoxed. I feel like just a break from my patterns is needed urgently....in addition to professional long term therapy and support. Has anyone gone to or had success with places like Alsana as an inpatient for a month? How did it work? I'm assuming stuff like Hilton Heads ""wellness"" retreats are unhelpful?

I was previously overweight and had frequent binge eating episodes but would do so in private and never spoke to anyone about my emotional eating habits. I started using a calorie tracking app to get to a healthy weight, but I still have the desire to lose more weight because I think I would like how my body looks if I could lose more.

I’m now at a point where all that I think about is food/calories and exercise. I made an appointment with a dietician to talk about how many calories I should be eating a day, my weight, diet, etc. and they said they didn’t feel comfortable sharing a specific caloric number with me because they feel that I am exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating and did not want to exacerbate it. She recommended I speak with a colleague who specializes in eating disorders so I set up an appointment.

I am aware that I am engaging in patterns of disordered eating because I do not trust myself to eat without tracking everything on the app. I’m scared that it may have progressed to a disorder at this point given what the dietician told me today. She recommended I delete the calorie tracker from my phone but I cannot get myself to so that (I have tried in the past but can never go more than a few days before redownloading)

My partner and family are big eaters, and encourage me to eat more even when I don’t want to. I don’t know how/if I should talk to them about this.

She seemed really keen about it so I was really happy, but then the conversation ended and I realised that I was feeling that feeling you get when you sink into a mindset, if you get what I mean. I could tell I was being affected by her and her comments about my bloating, looking like I'm pregnant, etc kinda made me put more attention on my body. For context, I had related to her when she said she looked pregnant at the end of the day, and she constantly used that as a way to talk about my weight. She compares herself to kpop idols and beats herself up for weighing more than them, when most are shorter than her and undergo severe diets and exercises to get to where they are today. I guess this post is a ""how do I help my friend without also relapsing into an ED?"" Post. I body check A LOT.

I lift my wrist to check how skinny it is and pull the collars of my shirts to check how square my shoulders are and how much my collarbones are visible.

Hello, my name is Winnie and I have been struggling with anorexia for a while.

Recently, I have made the decision to try and recover, although it has been extremely difficult without outside support to help me along the way. I'm making an effort to eat when I feel hungry, and to have foods that I want. Despite the anxiety and guilt, I try my absolute best to push through. I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.

However, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself ""oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,"" or ""you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.""

The stress has been piling up endlessly, which has been enhancing my psychosis and delusions as well on top of PMS.

Hey guys! I'm wondering if I've been exhibiting early signs of an eating disorder and if so, i want to curb it.

The main problem i have is that i am unable to lose weight at the moment. I've been gaining weight a lot recently for a couple of reasons.

1. Pandemic (i mean who hasn't had pandemic problems??)
2. I was cheated on (very bad depression. Was diagnosed with PTSD and find it hard to look in the mirror, much less appreciate my body and myself as a person)
3. I hurt my ankle very very bad and now have to go to physical therapy for it. Which means no exercise.

I am still at a healthy weight. But my jaw line is no longer defined, my tummy pushes out a bit more, etc. I can see that I'm gaining weight, but it's not something I'm freaking out about.

I don't want to wait until I'm so overweight I'm unable to walk out back, but at the same time, I'm struggling to even maintain my current weight because of the problems listed above.

I've always had an unhealthy relationship with food. But it was more of an ""i can eat whatever i want and not gain weight because i have a high metabolism"" and became ""i still eat as much as i want but my metabolism can no longer keep up with me""

Very recently i haven't been hungry. And I'm not saying that I've ignored my hunger, i have a hard time doing that. But i just physically haven't been hungry. I'll usually eat 3 meals and 2 snacks a day (for example) but recently it's been breakfast and a snack.

Today, i was hungry enough to eat 3 meals and 2 snacks. AND a desert. Great, right? But now I'm hungry again and wanting to deny myself food specifically because i felt like I've eaten too much today.

The PTSD issue (i hate calling it PTSD. I didn't go to war. But please don't come for me over it. It was a legitimate diagnosis), the lack of physical ability to work out, and the weird food flip I've done make me worried that I'm starting to develop some kind of eating disorder.

I (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me… I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that’s anxiety or if my body can’t handle food anymore.

My parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn’t help when they encourage it but I am always met with “we are just trying to make sure you’re healthy” and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.

I am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don’t know how I’d get there since I don’t have a car and my parents can’t know I’m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them?

I'm trying to eat like a normal person but for some reason I can't stop eating cookies and cake during the day. Like, yesterday I ate half a pack of cookies and 1/4th of an homemade cake. I don't even restrict on those, I mean not more than any person with an healthy relationship with food. I'm anorexic and I'm either restricting or eating junk food throughout the day. I don't think I would qualify that as a binge tho, because I can stop (I feel very sh\*tty when I'm snacking and because I live alone, thinking about the money I'm wasting by eating usually helps me stop) but I may be wrong. Whenever I'm home doing nothing I just feel the urge to snack on cookies, cake, toast etc... probably because I'm bored and then I feel guilty and restrict when it's actual dinner time which probably doesn't help... There's even times where I only eat cake for 2 days. Like as a meal.

About 7 months ago, due to my doctors instructions, I had to overhaul my diet due to some health issues. Before I went on this diet I was in a healthy weight, leaning a bit towards heavier than my usual weight since I had stopped working out during the pandemic. My health issues have been a significant part of my life for the past 7 years, and the possibility of not having to deal with them as much is honestly both scary and something I’m really looking forward to.

I have made good progress so far, and my health issues have reduced considerably. However, I fear I may have gone too overboard with the health regiment. I am now edging closer and closer to underweight than I have ever in my life, and I find it difficult to let myself eat bigger portions or add things to my diet that I shouldn’t have often (even if I’m allowed to every now and then). I haven’t really given myself any “treats” or off days in months, and I am starting to get anxious when I gain weight or feel like I’m deviating from my diet instructions.

I’ve always had a very healthy relationship with food, and I feel like I’ve lost that a bit. Some days I don’t even really feel hungry and struggle to eat because I don’t really have as much joy when eating, it all just seems like a “necessary for survival” thing rather than anything else. Some days I don’t have that much energy to do things either, though I am trying to eat balanced and in big enough portions.

Has anyone gone through something like this and could tell me how they managed? I just think I’m having a hard time finding the middle ground. I don’t want to end up being too weight conscious (which I already am, if I’m being honest) or damaging my health this way when I’m supposed to be doing this to get better. Is there anything I should be looking into or doing?

Hello,

I need some help. I have no official diagnosis yet but fall into BED (imo) and I am overweight. My Dr wants me to eat a particular diet which I have been trying to stick to since January but I fail. The longest I can stick to it is 12 days before I start to binge. How do I stop?

Also I am curious if it sounds like I have a disorder at all. I understand I would need to see a specialist someday for a diagnosis but would appreciate to hear if anyone else is like me. For me I can be not hungry for a long time and won't seem to struggle and then I get a sudden craving for a particular food and I almost eat nothing but that food for days on end until I get so sick of it and don't eat it for sometimes years. Sometimes foods I've never really eaten before or sometimes it is childhood comfort food. I've been like this for a very long time. I'll just eat it 4 or 5 times a day where as other days I can go most of the day not excessively peckish. I've been eating cheese and spring onion sandwiches for days on end and can't stop wanting them.

I am so upset with myself because I'm due to go back to my dr in a few days and no I've ruined the progress I made last month.

Looking for advice from anyone who has struggled with this. I grew up an athlete since 7 years old and competed through college, I did some marathons after college and eventually ended up with an autoimmune disease that forced me to the sidelines on occasion. I've struggled with over exercising and restricting/binging for many years. I had a good 5 years maybe that I actually stopped binge eating, even though I was exercising fairly heavily, I think because I was super strict with my diet as far as what I could eat basically meat, veggies and some fruit, I did this for my autoimmune disease but it really helped as far as not binging. I'm not a ""moderator"" as in, I find it pretty much impossible to eat just a little bit of certain things, they end up making me want more once I have them and I obsess over them (sugar in particular), so when I eliminated all of those triggers I didn't feel the urge to binge. I did eat a TON, but I finally felt good about my body composition and didn't feel crazy around food despite being fairly limited in what I was eating. It took my binge/restrict mindset away. I realize many people may disagree with this and think we all need to eat our trigger foods so we're not triggered by them anymore, but I've tried way too many times to do this and for me personally this doesn't work.

Enter Covid and a constant flare in my autoimmune disease, and staying at home I somehow thought I would just ""try other foods again"" to see if they made a difference in my disease. And now over a year later of back and forth binging/restricting/fasting over exercising, and I'm pretty much miserable right now.

I find that when I overdo it with my exercise, I get extremely hungry and stressed. It messes with my sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and then can't get back to sleep which then makes me crave binge foods more. However I feel somewhat addicted to working out, I think part of it is the endorphins it gives me, and I also don't know what to do with myself when I don't work out. I have other interests, but I feel as if something is missing when I don't exercise. I believe that if I could take some time off, it would be easier to get a hold of my eating and get back on track. I just am having a really difficult time convincing myself to do it. I tell myself again and again that I need to take some time off or that I won't push myself so hard when I go to the gym, and then I completely over do it and it sets me up to want to binge.

I know I can stop binging since I've done it before and legitimately thought I was done with it, but I did a year and half of tracking calories and lost quite a bit of weight, which I didn't really need to, and now I recently lost weight due to some antibiotics I had to take but am having rebound eating from that. Every time I lose a good amount of weight my body goes into overdrive to make up for it eventually.

To people who have never dealt with binge eating, I know this will seem stupid, but it's a legitimate struggle. I want to be able to work out hard without having extreme hunger and stress which leads me to want to binge, but I think I need to find a way to moderate my exercise. Does anyone have any tips or dealt with as similar situation? I'm revisiting Brain Over Binge and Never Binge Again, and I know I just need to stop reinforcing the binging, but I feel like my over exercise is a large component to this.

I should say I'm trying to get back to the way of eating I was on when I was binge free but it has been insanely difficult I think because I'm still currently working from home and my structure is not there like it used to be.

Okay so im making this post on behalf of my beautiful amazing girlfriend because honestly im at a loss. I strongly suspect she has an ED but she wont get tested because you can be professionally discriminated against (lower salary) if you have things like that on your medical record here (were hoping to move away one day but thats not in the cards until after she finishes uni and we both have some monry behind us), so we dont know what it is or if she has one but i really suspect she does as she has alot of symptoms in common with my best friend and cousin who both have/had eating disorders / body dysmorphia.

So, her symptoms (idk if thats the right word sorry) as far as ive seen so far is that she gets nauseous almost every time she eats; she has to force herself to finish the last bite as in her words she feels as though doing that is what will make her nauseous (which is part of why i believe the nausea is caused psychologically rather than physically but idk); she really cant eat alot normally unless shes having a good food day / is in a good mood; and alot of the times when she finds a food she likes, shell have it a couple of times then says its bland / makes her nauseous.

I really dont know what to do as were long distance right now because of covid and shes staying with her mother whonis very negative about food in general, criticises her for not eating enough but then when she eats foods that her (vegetarian, pseudo health science (literally believes you can live off of sunlight and water)) mother doesnt approve of shes negative then too, so my girlfriends entire attitude around food is very poor and she has zero support at home.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? And/or how to combat some of these symptoms or get around them?

Post: Almost 2 years ago I finally opened up about my anxiety and depression and got medicated/therapy. I never discussed with my therapist about this because I thought it was somewhat normal, but for around this time my depression was exceptionally high which caused my eating habits to be amplified. By this I mean that somedays I would be in bed until 3-6pm not having eaten anything, and not be motivated to do anything. As soon as I got up out of bed, I would start my binge eating. Usually I would eat one whole pizza, a big soda and just lots of junk food, and even then I would still eat more and more. some days I would just *choose* not to eat anything for no specific reason, and once I felt like it, I would start the binge eating again. Somedays I would have a regular eating schedule, but that was pretty rare.

Honestly, I don't know if this counts. I'm sorry for wasting your time if it doesn't. Since around 12 or so years old, or 3-5 years ago (I have difficulty with time due to trauma), my mother has been digging into my self esteem. She'd grab my stomach to show how 'fat' I was, even though I was a healthy weight. She's shame me about my body, tell me my stretch marks were gross. I gained a chest and a butt, unfortunately. My mother used this as proof I was overweight. She's used the things I love and my insecurities to pressure me to lose weight. When I told her I had dysphoria and didn't like my chest she told me to lose weight. When I went to a wresting competition she tried to get me to lose weight so I could be in a lower weight class. When I joked about how weird knees are, she told me to lose weight so I ""wouldn't have that extra skin"". I was encouraged to lose weight in unhealthy ways. I lost too much weight too fast and all she said is ""it doesn't show."" I was told to eat less that xxxx calories a day (very low)), which lead to me crying. I've vomited to get food out of me once, and I'm scared I'll do it again. I can't go to my mother because she wouldn't believe me because I'm not thin. I even had lipoedema, a disease characterized by fat in the legs that is metabolically independent. I was muscular! Every time I try to recover or build up my self esteem she tears it down again. I've considered suicide because of this. I wouldn't tell her that because it feels too manipulative. I just don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

Hi everyone,

I (25F) just want a safe space to talk. I feel a little lost. I hope this doesn't cause any triggers.

I've only started to accept the fact I don't have a healthy relationship to food the past maybe, year? *I fell into the false belief all these years that I wasn't a specific weight to be able to have a eating disorder*

I would binge eat a lot when I was 14 due to stress and living in a abusive household, I was the heaviest I had ever been. Then I started purging a lot when I was 16/17 because I wanted to lose weight after a break up, after awhile I got worried about my dental hygiene so I stopped. I thought this was a phase I was going through. I was wrong. I have been on a journey of self-love and healing for a few years now, but I've been on and off with smoking cigarettes (I also stopped abusing drugs and self-harming years ago) but my binge eating has slowly made its way back when I'm stressed/anxious/depressed, I'll eat too much too the point I'll throw up and then I will feel gulity and starve myself so I don't gain too much weight. I do try to eat healthy for a few days, but then I just get stressed and binge eat. The process starts again. Then I start smoking again (binge smoke for a few days) to stop my appetite. It's this constant battle. I do put on and lose weight very frequently, but not enough for it to ""look"" like I have a ED.

I got into a relationship a year ago and I've noticed I have been getting triggered a lot easier. My partner hates smoking and I agree because I dont want to be a smoker - but it's been hard to not smoke when I get triggered. My partner had a ex who had a ED and other mental health problems and I know this relationship affected him badly (emotionally abusive), so I don't want to tell him I have a ED. I've told him that the reason I smoke is because I eat junk food when I'm stressed out so I replace it with smoking instead sometimes. He's trying to be supportive of me quitting smoking but I haven't fully opened up to him about this side of me yet - and honestly I'm terrified to.

My triggers though...

I get triggered badly when I notice him looking at an attractive girl (he's not gawking, just a quick glare), when he likes photos of attractive girls, friends he has slept with or if I see him having a friendly conversation with a attractive girl while we're out. This stems from my own insecurities (I was sexually assaulted in my childhood and been cheated on in my last relationship). I don't want to control him. But these things really throw me off - I either binge eat or I lose my appetite completely. I get quiet, sometimes cry and skip dinner. It's hard to do this all away from him because we are currently travelling in a van. He gets worried about me and he tries to be there as best as he can, but I don't let him because I'm honestly still trying to process this and I have to deal with this on my own (No way I'm going to tell him my triggers, that will break his heart).

I've only opened up to my best friend about this recently and she's shocked because she knew I did purge in high school but thought I haven't had any issues since.

So the situation is pretty bad atm. The last time I saw them was last year and then it was bad. Our other friend saw him recently and said he was worse. I don't want to assume a diagnosis but they're extremely underweight. Veins are bones are prominent. They're quiet and they're family hasnt seemed to have intervened that much (I contacted a family member to ask about they're progress. ) me and my two other friends have tried to be gentle and ask in different ways ""what's going on?"", “how you managing? We all care about you and are a lil worried."" We are trying our best not to make comments on they're appearance and to just be there to make him feel supported in general. However this isn't enough anymore. Me and my other friends are currently in discussions about what we can do but we have never been in this situation before and we don't want to overstep a boundary and ruin our relationship with him and his family. Also to add he is trans so he is dealing with body issues on a whole other level.

I started a new job two months ago and the area I’m in is heavily male dominated, there are only two women in a 25 people group, so I immediately started bonding with this other girl, it also helps that we’re from the same country so it’s easier to engage in a conversation with her as we speak the same language.

All conversations are about fat-free, sugar-free, bad food, etc.

I think its because I've always taken medication that lowers my hunger combined with being a competitive athlete whose parents didn't feed me (no breakfast or lunch from grade 5 on, often no dinner until after dance was over at after 8pm). Until recently I didn't notice I've never eaten enough

&amp;#x200B;

I have to force myself to eat during the day, it feels like I could go days without eating and not be effected. It's rare I have hunger cues and have an appetite, it's often so low that the thought of eating makes me uncomfortable. If I do get hunger cues I often ignore them. I usually go without or force myself. I can't eat in public or around people in general because I either get regular anxiety that makes me feel sick or I avoid it because I'm worried about that happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Until night time rolls around... and I eat myself to sleep. This is where I get most of my ""nutrients"" - it's in quotes because it rarely stuff that's considered healthy. Sometimes I'll even wake up and eat to get myself back to sleep, even when I probably don't need to

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not obsessed with my weight and it's in a healthy range, but I do notice myself having body dysmorophia. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I should stop binging at night because otherwise I wouldn't be getting near enough calories. It feels out of control (during the day I don't have control over not eating enough and at night with binging). I've been prescribed those ensure drinks and I often rely on those during the day. I've tried scheduling meal times, planning my meals, and more. With no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like my last option is to start counting calories using an app. It seems like it could keep me on track, it helps for me to have very specific goals because while I have ocpd and perfectionist tendencies that I often use to my advantage to reach goals, I also have adhd that makes it near impossible to track things if they're not clear, specific, and easy. For reference, most of my negative ocpd/perfectionist tendencies have to do with relationships, my dr says it's good I often use them to my advantage while also trying to correct the negative aspects

403,EatingDisorders,"Hi, for context, I’m 22 and I embarked on a weight loss journey a year ago because I had gained weight over the pandemic. I lost a significant amount of weight and felt extremely good, I finally could go up the stairs running without catching my breath, my knees and back felt relieved and I loved the exercise that I was doing. I wasn’t cutting any food group, and ate dessert whenever I wanted, it felt like I was on the right track.

&amp;#x200B;

During my journey, I read and watched multiple videos on healthy weight loss and I was doing CICO while learning about healthy life. I never restricted too much, but I had some anxiety surrounding my caloric intake. I felt like I had to eat less than my calorie goal and it didn’t feel quite right. A few months after I started my journey we had a lot of issues at home, my sister got pregnant and my parents are extremely conservative. This took away my safe space and I stopped doing exercise and had to put up with my narcissistic parents and deal with their yelling and shaming. I was under a lot of pressure due to university work as I was doing my last trimester.

&amp;#x200B;

Christmas came around and I stopped tracking calories but didn’t eat extreme amounts of food, however, my mother would tell me that I had gained weight and my grandparents would constantly try to give me junk food, and I started to lose control over my diet. I would eat a lot and them try to get back on track and would fail miserably, I would always tell myself that I would try again on Monday…and fail yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m in charge of making the food at home, and I simply cannot stop snacking and trying the food right before I was done cooking. My parents constantly buy junk food, en even though I like it, it triggers binge eating because I feel hungry afterwards. Right then, it was when things at home got extremely bad and I spiraled down into a depressive episode and I lost control. I eat whenever I’m nervous or anxious, and my anxiety has been on edge these past months. I know I need therapy and/or a psychiatrist, but I have no funds and my parents won’t do it, they just don’t believe in it. Recently I’ve tried to go back to tracking and I started exercising but I constantly fail, I cannot even look back at the MyFitnessPal app because it shows how much I had lost and I have gained most of it back. I really enjoy exercising and even joined a group where we all help each other out, but I’ve lost motivation recently. I’ve never felt so out of control in my life and have no idea on what I should do next. I don’t even know if I’m just in a bad mental place or if it’s really an ED, maybe it’s both. Any advice?

404,EatingDisorders," 

When I was going into 7th grade, the month before school started, I just…didn’t eat. It wasn’t a conscious effort, I just didn’t feel like going to the kitchen to make anything.

I lost a lot of weight this way, and as I was overweight before, my mom noticed. She mentioned it and asked if I had anorexia but I said no, but what I noticed was that every time she mentioned me not eating, it made me want to go longer without food. I weighed myself a lot in this time.

Throughout the school year, my friends and one of my teachers commented, “you’re a twig” (and things of that nature) and “did you lose weight over the summer?”, respectively. For seventh and eighth grade, whenever I noticed my stomach was sticking out more than I liked, I would just think to myself “okay, just don’t eat until it’s flat”. I still ate a lot of snacks and food but I wasn’t physically able to eat as much as before.

My parents always comment on how thin I am, even though now I eat more (although very occasionally I feel regret when I eat a lot of snacks at once. I think of throwing up but I never go through with it), and I know I don’t have a healthy eating pattern, because I tend to go a long while without eating much and then I just eat a lot at once and the cycle repeats. I don’t consciously do it, but it happens.

My mom noticed I started gaining weight and mentions my stomach, arms, and face/chin a lot. I get kinda nervous when they take my weight at the doctors office because she asks them about my weight and how much I weighed at the last visit and I can’t tell what she’s thinking, as she has a poker face but also looks like she’s thinking. Before that summer before seventh grade, she also constantly talked about how I needed to lose weight and when I was a lot younger, she put me on a diet.

I don’t feel like this is an eating disorder, but is it?

TL;DR There was a period of time where I didn’t eat and wanted to stop eating even more when people commented about it or I noticed my stomach sticking out. I don’t mind how if I look bigger but I don’t like hearing that I gained weight or my mom hearing my weight at the doctors office.

405,EatingDisorders,"I'm gonna try to give you the background info as quick as possible:

&amp;#x200B;

Struggled with eating disorders my whole life, starting at about 12 or so. Really toxic family-you're familiar I'm sure. I don't want to get into the specifics of how unhealthy my relationship with food and exercise was- but I was big into pro-ana tumblr if that gives you some kind of measure of where my head was at. Somewhere in 2015/16 I started working on it and became more comfortable with food, and slowly over time I just.. abandoned all diet and exercise. I felt like I couldn't handle looking at any kind of nutrition or workout routine in a healthy way so I just tuned it all out. Not so shockingly, I ended up putting on a lot of weight. But to be honest, I didn't mind. I liked not having the stress of diet or exercise preying on my every move and destroying my mental health. I didn't love my body but I was accepting of her new look and figured it was a fair trade for not having to think about food/workingout/looking perfect all the time. That's the background story, more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Completely ignoring and avoiding something is not the same as healing from it and I came to recognize that. Since 2020 I've been slowly working on making healthier choices and being a little more active. And I liked it! This year I've started doing lots of activities that I've missed and feeling really good doing them. The last time I was active, it was a means to an end- I enjoyed the results and the process was sacrifice to achieve it. I forgot how great it is to run just for the pleasure of running. Physical activity feels amazing and brings me so much happiness! And I've been healing my relationship with food, making healthy choices for health's sake while still enjoying some less-than-healthy favorites. Honestly? I'm really happy with where I'm at and how I got here. It took years and I'm only excited to see where this goes. I would love to become more physically capable so I can enjoy more achievements within my new hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky:

&amp;#x200B;

Ana sits on my shoulder like a devil and whispers into my ear. I've noticed my own weight loss and I try not to give it too much space in my life. A part of me will always have that ED and I have to deal with that everytime I look in the mirror. That's a struggle on it's own, but one I've been managing.Everyone else, however, keeps commenting on my weight loss and its devastating. I'm aware that I've lost weight but I have been so so careful to make sure it's not a focal point for me. I don't count any calories or look at portions and I don't weigh or measure myself. I measure my progress in what I'm physically capable of. A few months ago I could barely run 3km. Last week, I ran 13km! I've put in a lot of work and I'm finally seeing progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I said that to a friend recently: that I had run 13km and I was happy to be seeing progress and he said, ""I'll say you can see progress! That shirt's hanging off you like a tent!"" A few people joined in behind him, remarking on my weight loss, singing my praises. My heart shattered. Weight loss hadn't even occurred to me as something worth being proud of. It was just a side-effect of my hard work. There I was beaming about my accomplishment and it was inconsequential compared to how i looked.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I have to work extra hard to make sure I keep my mind focused on what's important so I don't slip into a bad place- But that now that task feels impossible since it seems that everyone only cares about weight. It feels like I could run a marathon and they'd tell me how amazing I Look.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm disheartened. I haven't even lost that much weight (posting numbers is against the rules, but believe me, it hasn't been much and it's been over the course of months) and EVERYONE comments on it. I don't have a single person in my life who hasn't brought it up. It makes me sick and honestly? It makes me want to quit doing anything just so people stop talking about my body and my weight.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm terrified the more I get praised and complimented for my weight loss- the louder Ana gets. The validation of people liking me and liking my appearance more is equal parts saddening and tempting. I haven't slipped up yet: I'm still eating well and I'm not over exerting myself but I am thinking about my weight and my body more. I'm finding myself longing for more weight loss- and this wasn't the case before people started commenting.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed that off my chest, but I'm also looking for advice. It's a struggle quieting my own mind against ED... but the struggle of standing up to others and quieting their voices in my mentalscape was a challenge I wasn't prepared for.

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest this is hard for me to write out so I’m just going to state some facts. I am underweight. I purge at least 3 times a day, and up until recently was running every day as well. Then I became too weak to really continue that and things got worse.

I am experiencing some health problems, I’m not sure what I am allowed to say but I am very weak. I have been to a doctor who said I was malnourished. He wanted me to come back for weight checks but I never followed up. I have also been seeing a therapist for years (struggled with addiction but been sober for three years!) but I haven’t told her what’s going on regarding my ED. We have therapy over the phone so she hasn’t seen the change in person.

407,EatingDisorders," 

I've been underweight my whole life. I seem unable to gain weight even if I try. I don't really fear gaining weight- maybe a little afraid, but not much just because it seems unlikely that I ever would due to my eating habits.

I also love food. I'm passionate about cooking, baking, etc. Sometimes I have an issue with binging on desserts, and I do so privately so my partner doesn't judge me.

But most of the time, I under eat. I can't tell if I do it on purpose or not. I just take small portions and get anxious if I think about eating more. Sometimes I don't realize it's a small portion until after I take a picture of my food or something and then look at it again. I'll have a couple olives and feel guilty about it. I think the guilt is partially tied into financial reasoning and memories from a child where I was afraid about my parents being poor. If I have a binge eating session, the rest of the day or the next day I'll under eat to make up for the cost of the food I binged on. It's not like I'm in financial trouble now but I starve myself a bit anyway as a punishment or way of making up the lost money. When I'm stressed and having negative thoughts about my self, I'll also avoid eating too punish myself for being stupid or whatever it was that I was thinking negativity about.

I tried a version of a keto diet previously (not for weight loss) and became very obsessive over counting carbs and calories, and weighed everything I ate (including herbs) and tracked it. I think that opened my eyes to my general issue with food restrictions.

So, I want to ask if this sounds like an eating disorder.

408,EatingDisorders,"\\(Sorry I know this question has been asked many times) I’m 19 and I’ve had problems with eating since I was about 13 I think - I’ve always felt excessively guilty after eating meals and hate the sensation of being full because of the shame, physical discomfort and general panic it causes me. There have been a handful of occasions where this feeling has gotten so bad that I’ve made myself purge, but I mostly find it difficult so I try to purge after I eat somewhat frequently but most of the time I can’t get anything up. I then tend to resort to excessive exercise in the gym, and also when I don’t meet my step goal I feel exceptionally guilty and pace around my room until I get my target. 

I also count calories religiously and get very distressed when other people touch my food or cook for me because I don’t know how accurately I can estimate the calories. I know I have a bad relationship with food and I do talk to a therapist about it but I don’t know if I can call it a full-blown eating disorder because I’m technically overweight by bmi standards (mostly because of the amount of muscle I have as I lift weights 5x a week) and I don’t know if I’d call my weight loss “drastic” I’ve lost xx kg in a few months but then gained it back so I don’t know if I even meet the DSM criteria for Atypical AN. And I don’t know if I purge enough to be considered bulimic. I’m reluctant to self diagnose but I do want to have some sort of label because I always feel so invalid in the ED community.

Over the last year and a half, I lost weight very quickly. I began taking ritalin for my adhd and it made me nauseous to the point of not eating meals for a day or two at a time. Before that, I was always a healthy weight with some purging episodes when i was \~14 years old, due to body image issues. Those issues remained with me until last year. Now, at 20, I found i lost a lot of weight (especially in my breasts and butt) and feel very badly about myself. I thought i was so overweight before, up until a few months ago, but now realize i looked fine. Now on the other side of the spectrum, I feel very underweight and hate that i think i look underdeveloped for a girl my age.

I don’t know what any of this means, but i do know i am extremely nauseous all the time to the point where even if i want to eat, it’s difficult. I have been trying to gain weight and feel healthy again for almost a year now, but nothing’s changed. In fact, reaching out is partially due to my mom forcing me to weigh myself recently and saw I had somehow lost MORE weight. I haven’t had serious health complications/hospitalizations after losing weight, a few instances of almost-fainting (got better with rest) aside, and don’t know if my situation qualifies as an ED. I hate when people watch me eat (due to social anxiety), am extremely restrictive in intake when i thought i was overweight, and have body dysmorphia with any way i look.

I just dont know, should i definitely talk to my therapist about this? Could it be AFID? Anorexia nervousa? or is it not bad enough to be one of those, and is just disordered eating?

Hi, i just wanted to ask a question. I've been struggling with my weight for a while, it's an on and off thing, but i think it's getting worse.

I'm currently eating a sandwich while feeling very guilty and like i want to starve myself instead. In the past I've torn bills while hanging out with my friends to not be able to buy good cuz i was so anxious that they were going to see me eat and that I would look disgusting while doing it. I've had ideas of skipping meals but i never seem to go through with it, I've even thought about forcing myself to vomit.

I know that it can be bad for my health but i feel like i deserve this pain cuz i look so ugly.

414,EatingDisorders,"Does anyone have any tips and advice on recovering from an eating disorder? I don’t really have the best support system, outside of my significant other… My family almost always shames me for not eating enough, constantly pressures me into eating more, and makes rude, snide remarks about how I “probably won’t eat dinner tonight anyway” and “how do you expect to gain weight if you won’t eat dessert?” It feels like, no matter what I do, it’s never enough…

Mini-vent: I do want to recover… so badly… but for the last 5-6 years of my life, this is all I’ve known. I try to eat at least enough to maintain my weight so I don’t lose anymore, but that’s so hard on its own. I have this overwhelming need for control and order, and I need to stick to such rigid rules that don’t even matter, but with all my other diagnoses, it’s hard to… I hold it against myself, dissociate, and avoid eating because everything needs to be perfect and if it’s not, I can’t eat until it is… and it never will be, and so I hardly ever eat. It’s taken a toll on my body dysmorphia, making it the worst it’s ever been. I feel ugly the way I am, and I feel ugly if I gain any weight, and I just feel like I’ll always be ugly, so what’s the point in trying to recover? On top of that, I’m terrified of looking “womanly”. I’m nonbinary and I am constantly dysphoric about my body and appearance. I’m very fem presenting, but I’m terrified of looking any more womanly than I already do, and to constantly be perceived as a woman. Not eating somehow makes me feel more easy to pass as masc when I want to, but I’m equally as terrified as being seen as masculine as I am to be seen as feminine. I feel trapped in my body all the time because it will never look like how I want it to. It literally does not help that I relate my gender-fluidity more to cisness than transness—I always tell myself that I’m not trans enough and I get so hung up on trying to be female when I just genuinely don’t feel like that, and it’s a never-ending cycle that feeds into my eating disorder. And to make things worse, now I’m stuck in a depressive episode feeling both underwhelmed and overwhelmed with life, and I just wish I didn’t exist. I wish I could just return my life. I don’t want to be here, constantly feeling miserable all the time, wearing a fake smile so people don’t worry too much about me. I don’t know how to ask for help… but here I am, anyway. ):

It’s like little Spongebobs running around my brain, throwing files everywhere, starting a fire. My emotions are off the walls, but I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and numbness more often than not. It’s the complete opposite of my usual positive mindset.

My loved one says that the BMI scale does not apply to them since they are very tall (it doesn't really apply to anyone) but use this to deny that they are obese. They feel that since the BMI scale doesn't apply to them, there is no way to quantify? I guess? that their weight is too much. They have a very high body fat percentage and never intentionally exercise, and binge eat every day. (things like drinking several liters of soda in one sitting, eating nothing but sweets and pastries some days) They also spend our shared income on these excessive amounts of sweets, they buy a lot at a time and say that they're going to eat them slowly, but go through them in a day and go to restock.

We are unable to see doctors due to the high cost of medical, otherwise I would ask my LO to speak to a doctor about it directly. I live with them and their health does impact my quality of life as they are a caregiver for me.

Recently they had a health scare and it was a concern that their weight/unhealthy diet may have been the root of it, but when the health scare absolved itself on its own with time, they went right back to their habits.

I've talked to them about this before and on some level they understand that they are significantly obese and that even if they weren't, the way they eat is awful for anyone, but they don't want to work on it because then they have to think about it. If it were up to them, they wouldn't do anything productive or good for them (bathe, practice hygiene, exercise, wake up during the day, work), we both have some mental health struggles so I understand where they're coming from and we've both had to push eachother to work on these things.

Hi. I need some help, but where i'm from there isn't that kind of help available. So i thought why not ask reddit. Like what's there to loose.

Im 165 cm, xx kg (a little more than normal range of BMI). I am currently on a keto diet (kind of). You see, my problem with diets are always the same. I start restricting myself and then I developed an unhealthy relationship with everything im not allowing myself to eat until i reach a breaking point and buy what im not supposed to eat. Eat it, and then purge. Just a few days ago. I was so hungry. I left work, bought stirfry noodles with peanut sauce ate the whole thing then made myself purge..

I am not happy, I am never happy on a diet. I must go on a diet, because I can't limit myself and end up gaining too much weight to the point where I dont feel comfortable and am on the verge of getting diabetes (which a lot of my family members have they also have high blood pressure).

I have tried to get help. But to no avail.. I feel like this is going to be a struggle for ever and I don't know if I can live like this.

I dont know if this is the right place for this post, im kind of hoping it is. Has anyone had the same struggles, and later on over come them?

Everyone in my life has always been very concerned with if I eating disorder because I’m very thin. I always just thought that in the way that I deal with stress was I undereat. Some when they are stressed may eat a lot to cope, but I am the opposite. So, sometimes I’ll be hungry and go out to eat. I’ve always behaved weird when going out to eat. I’ll be hungry, and then the food will come out and I suddenly get turned off by the food (even if it looks good) and have difficulty eating it. I’ll always get a doggie bag to go, and I’ll leave it in the fridge and a day will pass and then it just goes to waste. And people get mad at me when I go out to eat and don’t eat enough. I always feel eyes on me to make sure I’m eating.

I never have counted calories, I do not make myself throw up, I don’t feel guilty. It’s just sometimes eating can feel daunting for me. Like a chore sometimes. I am very busy and i almost try to push off eating because I feel strapped for time a lot.

I think my main concern is that I lose my appetite when a large meal is prepared. But is this disordered eating? I always felt like I had a normal relationship with food. It’s not like I have a massive fear of gaining weight. I wish I was a little bit more curvy, but at the same time I kind of don’t want to get big.

And then people will tell me I have an eating disorder, and that “you just don’t know it”. It makes me upset because I don’t know what the truth is. I will say sometimes others can help give direction at times, but this is something I’ve experienced for a very long time. I don’t know what to do. I grew up with people making fun of me or embarrassing me for being thin and saying I’m “bulimic” and I have never, ever done that. I’ve gotten a lot of comments on my body by friends, partners, and family. It makes me feel gross.

What do I do? Does anyone have advice for how to deal with this? I’m genuinely trying to understand why I get turned off or nauseous around food.

My sister just said she won't eat today because she wants to get skinnier

I'm 20, and she's 12. My eating disorder started that way at 12, I thought I wouldn't eat for a day, after that, I haven't lived a day obsessing over food.

My mom, who probably has some form of Ed herself, talks often about losing weight. My sister is a bit chubby, however not overweight. My mom says that my sister, me and her all need to lose a bit of weight, even though my mom is skinny. On the other hand, I'm overweight. I messed myself up so bad that losing any weight is extremely hard.

I constantly think about food and any little things trigger me. I don't want my sister to suffer the same way I did. I tried talking to my mom, tried telling her not to tell my sister to lose weight, but she said that she thinks it's good if my sister starts thinking about weight, and being healthy.

I think that it's my mom's responsibility, as a parent to adjust my sisters diet, and not tell her she's fat. It breaks my heart. When I was 12, my mom told me that I was obese, and I believed her. I wasn't. I recently looked back at my old pictures and I was a normal kid. Not even necessarily fat.

I think she tries to ignore that time when I had anorexia and wouldn't eat for weeks straight, and at one point I couldn't even eat anymore, my doctor said that I would be hospitalised if I lose 4 more pounds. She never talked to me about that after I gained weight back, like it never happened, like I was always fat and disgusting and lazy bitch.

hi! i’m really sorry if this triggers anyone and if  you feel like it will just click off. anyways i’m confused if i just  have bad habits and “disordered eating”, not necessarily an eating  disorder.

basically i just moved away from my friends which isn’t great and  caused a lot of stress, i never really ate a lot before but i still had  the basic 2-3 meals. now i don’t even have that much, only some drinks  and a snack. i used to think it’s cause i was just stressed and i’d get  back to normal eventually but i haven’t. the real problem started when i  tried to get my eating back to normal but i just couldn’t, i’d feel so  guilty when ever i tried to eat a decent meal ,, so i just wouldn’t.  it’s never got to regular purging and it’s not like food is the only  thing i can ever think about so i don’t know if it’s an actual  disorder??? or just “disordered eating” because of a shitty situation  that spiralled out of control. i’m really scared that one day it’ll get  seriously bad and ruin my life and i won’t be able to do anything about  it.

It started a month or so ago- at least, that's when I began to notice that she'd lost a LOT of weight in an abnormally short period of time. Upon enquiring about her health, I realised that she hadn't been eating at all. Later, as I probed, I realised that she had been getting through her days on coffee and refusing to eat because ""food looks nauseating"".

She recently had issues with an irregular period as well, but they couldn't find any abnormalities in her physiological functioning as a cause. It is suspected to be a lack of nutrition, which leads me to believe that this issue may have been going on for longer than I thought it did.

I was a bit harsh, and might have overstepped because I was worried- I first tried to make her eat by asking her constantly about breakfast, lunch and dinner to make sure she didn't forget. I did not realise that this could be an eating disorder at first. I assumed she simply wasn't prioritising food enough and wanted her to take care of herself.

Later I realised that it was a lot more serious than that, and although I had tried not to, I was concerned that I was guilttripping her, which could do more harm than good. I apologised, and I don't ask aggressively about her food intake anymore- however, I feel like any efforts that she might have made when I did, have completely dropped now. She's been experiencing a cold feeling and dizziness at random times now. I'm quite worried.

My friend and I don't live in the same area anymore, so I feel a little less helpful than I could be, although we talk almost everyday. She's been in therapy for anxiety before, but her parents withdrew her a year or so ago. We don't know if they would be open to reconsideration since they're having issues with medical insurance right now. She recently started going on the pill for period correction, but it had a negative effect so they stopped her.

I know I shouldn't use Google as a diagnosis tool, but her symptoms seem to closely match that of Avoidant Food Intake Disorder. She complains that eating food makes her want to puke, and the thought of eating scares her abnormally. She's worried that eating food will make her feel sick, and she avoids eating because ""she's worried there'll be leftovers that she'll have to eat later"". Whenever she does eat, it seems to be tiny portions of random snacks that have no nutritional value- which probably increases the sick feeling.

Can someone give me tips on how to help her get into eating better and help her hold out until she can get therapy? Although she hasn't expressed much annoyance, I don't want to be overbearing- but her parents have given up on her eating breakfast and aren't aware that she isn't eating much else for the rest of the day.

I'm trying my best to emotionally support her, telling her that how she feels towards food isn't ridiculous in any way, and that her struggle is valid. I try to encourage her to eat in less aggressive ways, bringing up my lunch and trying to describe it in an appetizing way, etc etc. I might be doing it wrong though, so I'd really appreciate some pointers on how I can support her.

I’ve been doing so well… I went to a treatment program two years ago and I felt “cured”. I felt like nothing could ever make me restrict or use any ED behaviors again. I thought I was free.

A few months ago I started birth control pills, to prevent pregnancy. For many reasons I am not comfortable with other methods of birth control, like the non hormonal iud for example. The pill is pretty commonly reported to cause weight gain. I went into it telling myself that it would be ok, I could handle any changes that happened, it was worth not getting pregnant, etc. I learned that the hormones really just make you hungrier, they don’t magically make you gain weight.

However, learning this fact has made me so untrusting of my hunger cues ever since I started. I’m not consciously restricting but it’s like every time I’m hungry outside of a meal I just ignore it because I blame it on the pill and not my actual hunger. I don’t measure food anymore but I feel I have been eating less, but telling myself it’s not ED related. “Oh it’s just stress” “oh it’s the nausea from the pill” etc.

I don’t really body check anymore but I do own a mirror, and I wear clothes (lol). I don’t want to mention anything specific but now I’m noticing that little body checks I would have done a few years ago would make me very pleased, if I were to engage in them today. I don’t own a scale but it seems I’m losing weight pretty quickly again. I know I need to just force myself to eat despite the nausea, despite the stress, despite the fear of the birth control making me “too hungry”… but something in me is scared. I’m so angry at myself for being scared. I did it before. Why is weight gain still so scary to me?

I'll start by saying I'm already in contact with a therapist's office and waiting for them to get back to me once my insurance is processed. It's been two days now, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, because I think this might be the beginning of something I need to catch early.

I've always had body-image issues. I grew up with a father that made comments on my weight very often, even though I was never overweight as a child. I'm in my early twenties now, and overweight, and every time I come home, he comments in some way. Usually it's a comment on when/how much I'm eating. A few years ago, when I was a teenager, I started restricting under the recommended minimum. I stopped because I was recovering from an alcohol addiction and wanted to be honest about every aspect of my life. I've tried to lose weight more times than I count, and every time it ends in me giving up on the calorie counting and binging, sometimes for long periods, which has contributed to my weight gain. I'm told by my friends and men that ""it suits me"" and that they don't think I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop equating ""skinny"" with ""pretty."" But, more than that, now that I think about it. Worthy.

So, it started with that cycle again, just me deciding to count calories, but within the recommended range. And then I saw a pro-ED Tiktok, and then I sought out that kind of content, and started restricting far too much again. I've had physical symptoms now and it's scaring me. The thing that's scaring me the most is that I have tried to stop, and I can't. Now, the thought of food honestly fills me with dread. It truly feels easier to just be hungry than eat. I have done well these past two days, meeting the recommended minimum. I have a friend that's been checking in with me. The weird thing that's helped with it is intermittent fasting. It's like if I tell myself, ""Okay, you have to eat, and you have to eat enough, but only in this 8 hour period,"" it's doable, at least for now. But I'm terrified of what I might lower myself to tomorrow.

So I finally called a therapist. The thing is, I'm really afraid to be honest with her. I'm graduating college in a year, and it's been rough ride for me. I've been hospitalized for depression several times, and although I'm grateful that those inpatient stays saved my life, they did disrupt my life, especially my academic life. I can't bear the thought of losing what I've worked so hard for (to clarify, I'm taking classes right now to graduate on time). If I tell her how low I've been restricting (I'm trying not to use numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting too specific with what I have said), I'm afraid that she'll IVC me. I'm not underweight, again, I'm actually a good bit overweight, and I can't see any emergent symptoms right now - I also am not having any suicidal ideations.

I'm sorry, because I think I'm partially coming here for validation. I feel like I can't have an eating disorder because I'm overweight. I know if I were to tell my family, they would tell me that I'm ruining everything I've almost lost before, and the thing that kills me is I KNOW I am. I know why I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm still doing it. I ate enough today and yesterday, but I'm still spending so much time on those sites. And I still feel pretty when I'm hungry while I'm fasting. This is something, much like alcohol (which I haven't consumed in three years), I just don't think I know how to fix on my own. If I'm told that she probably will commit me, honestly, that's fine. I'll go and I'll be honest anyway, because I have to be alive to graduate. I just would like to know what to expect. It's also good motivation, in a macabre way, to eat enough in the days leading up to meeting with her. Any suggestions people have that have worked for them to get themselves to eat are more than welcome. I want to eat, I do, I'm just afraid of it. I'm thinking of calling my best friend and asking if I could send her my calorie counts at the end of each day for accountability, but I don't know if that's crossing boundaries too much - I don't want to make someone else feel responsible for my safety. She's a sweetheart and I know she'd say yes but I don't want to be codependent with her. I'm just trying to think of ways to stay safe until I can get some help, and I don't know that fasting is the right way to do it. That could spiral, too.

Sorry, this has gone on forever.

TL;DR - I'm going to a therapist about restricting my intake too low and I'm afraid she'll IVC me. I'm asking for experience on getting yourself to eat when you're afraid to do so, and also wondering if fasting could put me in more danger even though it's helping right now.",,Request: I'm afraid to see a therapist because I'm afraid I'll be committed,39,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,oc6tq1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oc6tq1/request_im_afraid_to_see_a_therapist_because_im/,1625219329,886,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments on weight from father, history of body image issues, exposure to pro-ED content",harmful,"Restricting food intake to the point of physical symptoms, Fear of being honest with therapist and potential hospitalization, Feeling like cannot have an eating disorder because of being overweight, Using intermittent fasting as a way to control food intake and feeling pretty when hungry","Negative comments on weight from father, history of body image issues, exposure to pro-ED content on Tiktok",harmful,"Restricting food intake to dangerously low levels, Feeling scared of food and equating ""skinny"" with ""worthy"", Physical symptoms and fear of lowering food intake further","Body-image issues from childhood, father making comments on weight, exposure to pro-ED content, fear of being honest with therapist, fear of being hospitalized",harmful,"Restricting food intake to dangerous levels, Experiencing physical symptoms related to malnutrition, Feeling afraid of food and equating ""skinny"" with ""worthy"", Feeling like they cannot stop restricting despite physical symptoms, Considering using intermittent fasting for accountability, Feeling like they cannot have an eating disorder because they are overweight, Feeling like they are ruining their academic progress"

Hello. I’ll be honest, 4 months into recovery, and I still can’t accept how my body has changed. I’m having daily panic attacks over my shape during trips to the bathroom. I’m also distressing knowing that all of this anxiety hasn’t gotten me to stop eating like I want. It feels like every waking hour of my life is spent dealing with nagging thoughts about eating and hunger. I’m insatiable, and I’m now the biggest that I have ever been.

Nonetheless, I saw to my ED specialist today, and she wasn’t concerned about my weight or my eating. She specifically quashed my fear that I might be bingeing, so now I’m not sure how to deal with my appetite and changing body. All I want to do is go on a diet to lose weight, but everyone—from my doctor to my therapist to my girlfriend to my own inner voice—is telling me I shouldn’t do that.

I’m currently grappling with a full fledged eating  disorder for the first time in my life, but I’m going to therapy and  really trying to overcome it. 

I have a very small circle of friends because of life circumstances.  One of these friends I see every now and then, she usually suggests  dinner or a drink which of course is extremely difficult for me. 

During the meal, she will mention several times that she either A)  did not eat at all until then, B) she worked out intensively that day,  or C) that will be all she eats for the day. 

Obviously, these comments are really triggering to me. I’m so  desperately trying to overcome my behavior of restricting food, but  whenever I’m out with her, she acts like it’s a normal part of every day  life. 

To my knowledge she does not have an eating disorder; she is just  insanely competitive about everything. In the past, she’s asked me about  how much money I make, tried to see if me and my boyfriend have gotten  in any fights, or even pried into any family issues I might be having  (her family situation is super rocky). I’ve suspected for years that she  has always tried to make things a competition between us and I can’t  stand it.

I used to have a pretty severe eating disorder. I would barely eat,  and then when I did I would see red and eat everything in sight. Often, I  would binge really unhealthy food, and then feel guilty and force  myself to throw it up. It was really toxic. But, I turned it around and  established a workout routine, started having a more stable eating  schedule, and gained a lot of weight to where I was healthy. Now, I'm  still pretty healthy, but I've always kept a really bad relationship  with snack foods. I will start and finish an entire large bag of chips  and it feels like I physically can't stop myself. My cravings often win,  and I don't know how to put a leash on my cravings. The worst part is,  after I binge I still have the gut instinct to throw it up to try and  undo the calories, fat, sodium, sugar, etc. Any advice on how to deal  with this?

Is this an eating disorder? I'm sorry in advance if this triggers you So, in the past few months there’s been a ton of shit happening in my life. Family issues, friend issues, my ex tried to commit suicide, it’s just been a lot.

I’ve been struggling with this for a while and my love ones have noticed, and I’ve asked them for help but I’m not sure if it’s just body dysmorphia?

I feel super panicked to eat certain foods, Let me give an example,

The other day, my best friend and my family and I went out to dinner. I had a swim meet and the only thing I had to eat before that was coffee, and one of those low calorie fiber one bars. I did go to work and I ran to target and I purchased 4 Alani nu energy drinks and two boxes of the fiber one bars, and some other non related food things but it was a lot of money I had spent on food.

My best friend came over before we went to dinner and she made a pop tart in my toaster. I told her she was crazy for eating one of those because they are full of sugar and I read this thing that someone literally died from eating one of those. Those things are just cookies basically. And she knows about my eating habits because its gotten better but then I would fall back into the bad path again. She asked me why I was freaking out about those damn pop tarts and I just said they are so bad for you. And she was like well yeah, but you gotta live a little sometimes dude. I said, yes I know.

When we got to dinner, the only thing I ordered was a side salad, which was xxx calories which was perfect for me. She ordered a thing of chicken wings and fries. She tried to put a couple fries on my plate and I quickly told her no. It was a different type of fear that I had felt. She was like, “ok dude.”

I was over at her house last night and her mom made dinner. I was a bit anxious to eat because I went to the gym after swim practice yesterday and I really didn’t want to waste all the calories I had just burned. I just decided to eat a little, because I knew she would flip shit if I didn’t eat, and so would her parents. I put 2 tiny pieces of the little chicken breast and maybe a tablespoon of the salad. Her mom noticed, she says “you eat like bird! Is that enough for you?” My friend says,”She used to eat more.” And then proceeded to give me a really hard look. I told her I’m fine and she doesn’t need to worry. I finished my dinner, and I was helping her do dishes and she was talking about how a milkshake would sound so good. And I told her “ew no” she said,”you used to love those, why doesn’t anything sound good to you anymore?” I said “I don’t know.” And I told her again not to worry and that I was fine and she worries way too much, which she does sometimes😂

We went to the grocery store and I was helping her shop and we were in the ice cream isle and I was so anxious. She’s my best friend, so sometimes we do stupid stuff, this time, I was sitting inside the cart. I was very tired and I was zoning out, that’s why I didn’t want to walk. She was talking about dessert, and I made a face. And she goes,”are you a sugarphobic now?” I feel like I am lol. And I said idk, and then I brushed it off again.

A few hours later My stomach was hurting a lot, so I was laying on her bedroom floor. She asked me if I was ok and I said yes. She told me that I could go home if I wanted to, and I told her I was fine. We were talking and my brain kept wandering and I kept forgetting what I was talking about. She went to the kitchen and got an ice cream bar, I said,”how can you eat one of those things” and she was like because they are good, and you should have one too. And I said,”no I’m tired and I’m going home” so I got up and then I said, are you going to walk me out? Bc she always does! And she said no. I mean it was fine.

Hi there, F34, first time here on reddit. I have recently come to the conclusion that I have an eating disorder, I'd say it's some sort of anorexia, but I only ever find resources about anorexia nervosa, which I think is not my issue. My problematic relationship with food is rather a consequence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and ADHD. I've had episodes of complete loss of appetite since I was a teenager, sometimes it would last days, sometimes weeks, but it would always be linked to some sort of preoccupation that led to anxiety (important exam, new job, heart break and such). I've had only one episode of some sort of bulimia, where I would feel hungry all of the time, which lasted about a month. In the end I never worried too much about it, because it would last a limited amount of time, and then things would go back to normal. But this year has been different. It's obviously been a tough year, psychologically speaking. But I first noticed a weight loss upon getting a serious parasitic infection, which makes sense. The problem is I never quite recovered appetite, cause depression and anxiety piled up, and then I started medication that also tends to lower appetite. Work has been really tough (I'm doing a PhD overseas), and the work load and stress is just too much for me to actually care to think about food. All in all, I lost xxkg in less than a year (I'm 1m64 tall, and went from yykg to xxkg, which makes it 20%). In the past months I've also been exercising quite a bit, for I took dance classes that helped me cope with stress. Right now I'm trying to get into healthier habits, chill a bit, dedicate more time to my crafting hobbies, etc. I'v gotten more appetite, but when I do eat complete meals I end up feeling stomach sick, I guess because my body's not used to it anymore. So I guess what I need help with is, how to go back to a healthy diet, given that I've spent months eating very little, and that I have little free time and the whole ""planning for meals, going to the super, cooking, doing the dishes etc"" seems pretty overwhelming to me? What easy/quick/healthy food could I get? Any other recommendation or resource welcome.

I mentioned to my therapist on our call yesterday the fact that I really think I might have an ED. She agrees that there’s something up and we went through her little diagnosis book and answered all the questions for each. I was kinda leaning towards it being one thing but she really feels like it’s just unspecified. I’m a little confused now I guess. If it’s unspecified how do you know how to treat it? She also kept saying I wasn’t an unhealthy weight which was kinda invalidating because while yes I’m not currently an unhealthy weight I’ve lost a LOT of what I did weigh and I’m on the way to being underweight. I want to get a handle on this but I feel kinda discouraged that it isn’t anything really specific because it still just means I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m supposed to go on vacation to my absolute favorite place here in two weeks and I know I won’t cure my ED in two weeks I’d like to get motivated to start working on it and enjoying the food I used to love so much while I’m there.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience- I don’t really get super hungry anymore, nothing also sounds good. Sometimes I can think of a single thing that I could eat in that moment but it’s usually like something really specific and then when I get it sometimes it’s fine (I still only eat half) and other times I eat a few bites and it’s as repulsive as everything else sounded. I know I need to eat but I can’t find anything and then I have a panic attack. But at 11:30 at night I go ugh I’m hungry and I make a chocolate pop tart and a glass of milk even though the rest of the day food gives me anxiety or I just don’t care enough to eat. I also struggle with wanting to spend the money especially when I don’t finish anything I eat it feels like a waste (I try to do leftovers but I eat so irregularly that they go bad before I get to them or I just don’t want them)",,"Request: My therapist says I have an unspecified ED, how do you treat something if you’re not sure what it is?",15,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,oatsju,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oatsju/request_my_therapist_says_i_have_an_unspecified/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/oatsju/request_my_therapist_says_i_have_an_unspecified/,1625045848,369,0,0,0,-1,1,"Acknowledging and seeking help for the eating disorder, receiving validation from therapist but also feeling invalidated by being labeled as ""unspecified""",neutral,"Feeling discouraged and unsure about how to treat the eating disorder, Experiencing lack of appetite and struggling to find foods that are appealing, Feeling anxious about spending money on food and wasting it",Seeking help from a therapist for a possible eating disorder,neutral,"Therapist diagnosed the individual with an unspecified eating disorder, Individual feels discouraged because they don't know how to deal with it, Struggles with finding the motivation to start working on recovery","Talking to therapist about possible ED, feeling confused and invalidated by diagnosis",neutral,"Feeling discouraged about not having a specific diagnosis, Experiencing loss of appetite and difficulty finding foods that sound appealing, Struggling with anxiety around food and wasting money on uneaten food"

I now f19 have had issues with appetite since I was 15. Around 15 I started becoming underweight, because my appetite left. It’s like everything taste like card bored or makes me gag or has a really bad texture or taste, even if I love the food, because of the fact that I have no appetite.

Cannabis is the only thing that has helped me, I practically can’t eat without it. It’s helped me gain weight some. But now, even with the Cannabis it’s like my appetite issues it fighting through it, and My stomach isn’t able to eat as much. Im loosing weight again and it’s worrying me and I also feel weak all the time now, I feel like I’m starving all the time. I get this wave of nausea and a pit in my stomach a lot too, and I’ve realized it’s from hunger. I just want to enjoy my food and pig out. But I can’t. Now I’m also dizzy/nauseous through my eyes. This started when the appetite issues started up again. It feels like I’m stuck on a fair ride the ones that make you sick.

I am very uneducated about ED’s, but from my understanding, you normally care ALOT about your weight or body image and that causes you to shift your food and eating tendicies… my mom and brother and boyfriend all think what’s going on with me is an eating disorder.. but i don’t really care if I’m skinny or midsize… so Can it really be one? I hope this doesn’t come off as rude or dumb… I’m genuinly concerned.

I knew about this then and then she got better, for a while  She never spoke about it much and she helped me through depression for years but didn't speak about her own struggle really. For the last two years she and I haven't been home together so I didn't know she wasn't well again, but a few days ago we came back home for the summer and I heard her vomiting in the bathroom after dinner.. It threw me back to when we were younger and I didn't know what to do except stand rock still behind the locked door and think emptily, until she opened the door and I acted like nothing happened or I left before she opened it. So there I was again, standing there like an idiot. I want to help so bad, especially cuz she's done so much for me and I love her infinitely, But behind a locked door I couldn't really stop her from vomiting and obviously that's not a thing

binged yesterday, but today I bounced back. Hello [r/BingeEatingDisorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder), this is the first time I wirte here. I am 18M and normal weight right now I am not very active due to an overtraining injury that didn't heal properly (another binging problem I had, but that's another story). I don't have a binge eating disorder to the extent that some poeple on this sub have, but I do have my fair share of struggles with food, hunger and satiety, and to a lesser extent body Image. It is 10pm as I'm writing this post, and I feel like I wanted to share this story.

me, my mother (who BTW lost a lot of weight in 2018-2019) and her husband (not my dad, my mom is a single mother) are right now at a hotel. the hotel has breakfast and dinner. on thursday my family went to a restaurant, and I ate a pretty hefty meal around 5pm. then there was dinner and I was not hungry, so I ate a small dinner bc I know that if I don't eat something in the evening, I can't fall asleep (yes, it sucks). It was around xxx calories. friday morning (yesterday) I ate for breakfast a huge meal, and for dinner, It was a motherfucking feast. *meal details deleted*. I was absolutely conscious about that (although not completely under my control), and it was planned ahead (I told myself ""fuck it, I'll just eat undtil I'm stuffed because this is food that Isn't readily available at home usually"") after the meal I was stuffed as hell, and had a few mini-pukes. I told myself, while looking in the mirror and having my camera on ""I am worried for you [u/nothereforupvotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/nothereforupvotes), I don't want you to develop and eating pattern like this, of eating until you are stuffed and gaining fat. tomorrow you will eat 2 slices of bread, a small container of cottage cheese, an egg, and a lot of veggies, maybe a small savory pastry (kid of a trigger but I ate only a small one). understood?"" I didn't beat myself up as much (and when I did, I said ""this is an alarm going off, that something isn't right. I can do this without beating myself up"") which is an achievement bc I used to beat myself up after occasions like that"". "" then went outside for a little bit, wrote down my thoughts and feelings about this event and other events throughout the day, and then got into a convo with a friendly couple that also slept in the hotel. woke up at around 9am today (saturday), went to breakfast with my mom and kept that promise.was full, but not stuffed. then around 2pm there was lunch and I slightly overate (more than I planned) but not to the extent of what happened on friday It was much better. an hour ago I ate a large salad and a small bowl of mac&amp;cheese. I was proud of myself for bouncing back and not going to the other extreme like I see other people do on this sub. I am really happy for myself for not purging/starving like othe people would do, and wanted to share some tips that when I do have a successful time managing my eating.

find passions unrelated to food, or at least not eating it. music (huge one for me), hobbies, skills, shows on TV.

hard AF, but try to be compassionate with yourself. Instead as labeling yourself as a ""pig"" or a ""fatso)"" but telling yourself ""I have a problem, and it sucks. I want to have better habits and be able to control myself.

prepare your meals ahead of time, and eat low calorie dense foods that taste average to good, so they won't be extremely disgusting to the point of not being able to stick long term, but not extremely delicious so you'll be able to stop.

find an accountability partner with the same interest (for me it's my mom who tries to maintain a healthy weight and has a history with being overweight)

try and understand the root of your binges. maybe it's lack of other interests other than food, boredom, FOMO (a huge reason for me) trauma, mental health disorders, etc. I don't want to be a holier-than-thou, rather give people hope, BC this sub is at times very pessimistic.

tl;dr- went to a hotel, gorged insane amounts of food in the span of 30 hrs, but held myself accountable and bounced back with a healthy and relatively small breakfast, avoiding compensatory behavior.

446,EatingDisorders," 

So I havnt binged or purged in the last 2 weeks AT ALL. Partly because I was at training for work and didn't really have the freedom to eat as I usually would, and secondly because I was making an effort to use that time to jump start my process of quitting. Now that I'm home, I've gone 4 days without it but every day has been an absolute BATTLE. Last night I gave in and drove to a drive thru, ordered my food, got to the pay window and my card declined (found out it got shut off by my bank due to fraudulent activity) so I couldn't actually get the food. I went home and went to bed, thinking maybe that inconvenience was a blessing in disguise. But even today so far I'm so tempted to just go smash through some drive thru food.

Hi all,

My boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.

After those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.

It's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.

I know there's no possible way that he, himself, thinks he might have an eating disorder, or that his dieting is causing him these issues. If any of you have any suggestions on steps I can take to either make him aware of how dangerous this can be, or suggestions about what to do in general it'd be greatly appreciated.

450,EatingDisorders,"Hi All;

Quick background - early 40s, F, single and I have had an ED (to my estimation) for the past 12 years. about 8 years ago my girfriends had an intervention with me about my weight loss and my size and were concerned for my health (which I was able to concede eventually at the time, I was indeed suffering from an ED and it was causing health problems) I also agreed at the time to understand ED's are not ever cured but instead we must be consciously aware of them for life. 

I then began to gain weight again (yoyo up time) and silly me forgot EDs  life long hold. I proved overtime my ED was in fact NOT all behind me. 

About 5 years went by and I was realizing I had begun to swing the other way. I was a junk food addict.  I up-ed my exercise to stop the gain (blame excercise not food) but it did nothing.  Then it peaked last year (adding in the pandemic) and sadly I had gained too much, my health was starting to suffer from over-weight problems. So I decided 2021 would be a year to rectify and get back to healthy again. To find a happy medium. And to make myself accountable for it and do it consciously! 

So never being a stranger to EDs, I made my healthy meal plan, spoke to one of my GFs to be my moderator/ sponsor (AKA - she would hold me accountable to be safe while loosing, and report me if I was being unsafe.) I also refused to be a scale hugger (only weigh in once a month - not 3 times a day like before) and tried to go at this safe.  And its worked! I hit my goal weight this month. I am so grateful for my friends and family to help me, but its not over yet sadly.  And being at the ""healthy"" finish line, I have hit a snag. 

Problem is I have passed my loss limit (not by much) but I am still dropping. My GF sponsor is fully aware and I just told her the numbers (nothing to concerning but its notable). I want to tell her and my doctor that I will stop loosing, but I am worried I won't know how.  I started adding calories back to stop it but its not helping. 

Therefore, I'm hoping someone here has healthy ways to begin a maintaining weight plan. (not so much calories/ foods/ exercise) but perhaps tips around times I eat, or exercise. Or skills around making sure I don't panic about a pound here or there fluctuations. Since I am concerned about the loss, I am planning to weigh myself more often to make sure I'm stabilizing but I am fearful of a relapse (becoming a hugger again). 

As I am sure  others on here can vouch for, being the size and weight you want *SHOULD* be time to be happy and proud. I am sadly not feeling this, instead I feel a bit stressed knowing that I am no longer in a loose mode/ (or gain mode) and I never tried to find a ""happy or stabilizing"" mode. Is there anything I can do to be happy and confident as I am sure stress is not going to help this process.

It’s only been a year though, and I still have bad mental health days sometimes and I do get triggered when I see or hear people speak about diets, numbers on nutrition labels, or weight loss/gain, but for my sake no in in my life brings these topics up, including him. However he’s always been really self conscious about his body lately. he’s very attractive, thin with a muscular build, and tall, but he’s from a family where every women has an ED and is very fat phobic. He’s very body positive and not fat phobic towards me or anybody else, but lately I’ve noticed him body checking himself a LOT. Every time he walks by the mirror, he looks at his body from all angles and sees how far his stomach is sticking out, he does this more times a day than I can count. We’ll be watching TV and he’ll get up to do this and then immediately go back and sit down. He also started skipping breakfast, and when I try to get him to eat something he says he’s not hungry, and most days he’ll skip lunch too and claim he just forgot. He confessed sometimes he tries to see how long he can go without eating, just out of “curiosity” but I think it’s more than that. He has noticeably lost weight, despite the fact that he was already thin to begin with. 
A couple nights ago I told him the fasting and small amounts of food he’s eating was worrying me and I asked if he was dieting. He said “to be honest every time I look at my stomach I feel disgusted, but I’m not doing anything about it”. There’s a scale at his dad’s house and he confessed that he’s been weighing himself every time he goes over, and sometimes he visits just to do that. I told him this wasn’t normal, and that I was limited on my abilities to help him without getting triggered, but I needed to know that he was going to bring this up to his therapist. He refused to bring it up in therapy and then agreed he just wouldn’t talk to me about it.

459,EatingDisorders,"Hello, if you do post this, could it be anonymous? My post is as follows: 

I have always struggled with my relationship with food. At the age I became aware of my body and the concept of an “attractive” and an “unattractive” body (i.e 12 y o), I started either eating in extremes as a reward or I would eat scantily for months as a suffering to look a certain way. 

I’m 30 now and but this habit seems to stay. There is a lot of emotional eating and withholding involved. Because of it, I have had to face a myriad of health issues. I got pancreatitis and it gets flared with high fatty food. So either I don’t eat at all, or I eat a lot of high fat content food that has triggered many pancreatitis episodes. Similarly with exercise…either I over-exert myself or I don’t exercise for months altogether. 

Food is not a means to survive for me but a means of enjoyment or punishment. I’m in therapy and this is the realization I have reached. But nothing has come out of it. Unfortunately, there has been throughout my life, a lot of fat shaming from near and dear ones.

460,EatingDisorders,"My partner has struggled with weight and image problems her whole life, and has been having a hard time managing it while we're at the beach with her family. This morning she was in a great mood until I said I didn't want me first tattoo to be one she designs - I'd be happy to get her art on me, but not for the first one. She got upset and left the room, and came back a bit later still carrying a worsened mood but would talk to me. She was getting ready and looking in the mirror when she mumbled ""whatever"", which she does when she's annoyed (often at me). I ask what's upsetting her, and to summarize she gets upset that I assume it's about me (the tattoo), that I think her ED struggles just go away, and that they aren't bothering her even when she seems ok. 

I apologize and say that I thought she was upset at me because she her mood changed following the tattoo conversation. She says I never stop when she asks to, shouts at me some, and leaves.

In times like this, what should I do? I didn't know she was treating me poorly b/c of her struggles with her ED, and she wasn't willing to talk to me about it when I asked her what's bothering her. In this case she had a reason to be mad at me (tattoo), so I don't think it'd be right to assume it's about her ED. What do I do?

461,EatingDisorders,"I know this community has put up a post on how to help a loved one in treatment but my sister seems to be on the path of developing an ED. I want to know how to help her, I hope this is the right sub. Apologies if it isn't, please do guide me to one that can help if possible. 
Since the pandemic started, my sister began to restrict her meals (she still takes three meals a day but she admits that it's only because of how strict my parents are about making sure we don't skip meals). She started to exercise regularly, which seemed fine. Over the course of last year, she lost a bunch of weight visibly and my (very South Asian, not too sensitive) family made sure they told her how much they've noticed it. When she went back to school, her friends and teachers commented on it too (which made her feel worse, as she told me, ""Does this mean I was really that fat?"")
I had been feeling strange about it and so have my parents, because she used to snack earlier and give in to cravings and now she completely stopped any of that. There were multiple fights over it. Now, she has confessed to me that she's acknowledging that her relationship with food is strained. She has been counting calories on an app for months and even when she deletes the app, she often remembers by now what dish is worth how many calories. She cried to me and said that she thinks she's going to get worse. She also explained that she sometimes spits her food out in the bathroom (no throwing up) because she feels guilty with every spoon that she takes in. On the days she does not exercise, she feels guilty about eating anything at ALL. Basically, it is something that has been bothering her, disrupting her everyday functioning, and actively visible in the way she continues to reduce her eating.
I haven't experienced anything like this in this magnitude. I really want to help her (and she also does want to help herself), just don't know how. I told her that the next time she wants to spit her food out, she should come to me and we will swallow a bite together. And when she is craving chocolate but is stopping herself, to take a small piece and swallow it with me. I'm not sure if it is helpful but I wanted some tips/guidance on how to help someone who may show signs of a developing ED or simply a deteriorating relationship with eating.

462,EatingDisorders,"Hello, 

I have struggled in the past on and off with disordered eating (most closely resembling BN, but never sought diagnosis, just recovery). My most recent and most severe lapse was last year during quarantine, wasn't fun. 

With the help of my therapist and husband I managed to stop all behaviors, as I knew I wanted to start a family and my body needed to be able to support a baby. I gained a lot of weight obviously, reaching an overweight BMI, and felt very uncomfortable in my body. Then I got pregnant. 

My morning sickness was bad, and I ended up genuinely unintentionally losing a lot of weight in my first trimester. This I think is what triggered me, the weight loss felt fantastic. I was miserable of course I felt like I had the flu for nearly 2 months straight, but I was weighing myself every week to track how much I'd lost. Sometimes if I had a good day and could eat a lot of food, instead of being happy for the calories I managed to get in to fuel me and baby, I would agonize on whether to resort to old behaviors to compensate. I never did, thankfully. I've been able to put me and baby ahead of ED, but...it was harder than I'd like to admit to make that decision sometimes.

Now my nausea is gone and I feel great, and I know I'm going to start gaining soon, which is GOOD because you need to gain a certain amount in pregnancy for a healthy baby, even if you have an overweight BMI like I do. But even at a lower weight now than when I got pregnant...I'm starting to show, my belly is bigger. But I honestly just look...fatter than before. It doesn't look like im pregnant yet properly. I just have a big tum.

And im just suddenly so disgusted by my body again. I hate it. Not even just my belly, everything I can hate thr size of and want smaller, I do. I've always heard how pregnancy really makes you appreciate your body and see it in a  new way because its creating life...but I feel fat and ugly and I just want to keep losing weight. I'm avoiding scales because I'm scared at how upset I will be. But when I have to weigh myself at the doctor every time that number is seared into my brain.

I guess I just wanted to get out there how im feeling, and see if anyone has been in the same boat, and has any words of wisdom or advice for me because I feel like one heckin failure right now for having these thoughts even though I love my little baby in there and want him to be healthy and happy. I want to do, and eat whatever it takes, but im scared of my own thoughts and scared that even though so far I've been able to push through and do what I gotta do...that one day ill fuck up. 

I wanted to feel in love with my body, not be thrown back into destructive ED thoughts.

467,EatingDisorders,"Hi. I (15f) have been struggling with a restrictive ED for over a year now. This led me to becoming extremely underweight and in a life-threatening condition. I had numerous deficiencies, amenorrhea, hypotension, bradycardia, and was at risk of heart failure. If I’d continued like I was, I knew I would probably die, but I had trouble caring. It was only seeing how devastated my parents were when my family doctor had me admitted to the hospital that I decided to comply with recovery. I chose it for them, not me. Stress got my heart rate up enough for me to leave inpatient quickly, though, and return home. About a month and a half later, this is still the case. I’ve more than doubled my caloric intake, but my parents and paediatrician want me to consume over a thousand more than I am now for rapid weight gain.

I can’t bring myself to do it, but my parents are counting calories and serving me food to ensure that I eat as much as they want. I’ve been lying and I feel absolutely awful for what I’m doing, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I’ve turned to either pouring drinks down the sink, flushing it down the toilet, or feeding it to my dogs (when safe for them) to avoid eating food. Has anyone else experienced this compulsion? I’m desperate to stop. I’m literally flushing money down the drain, and soon enough some doctor is gonna catch on that I’m not gaining as much as I should be.

Note that I am still eating enough to gain weight. I think I’m just scared of surrendering control and eating this much and not being able to stop once I’m at a healthy weight— I’m scared of spiralling out of control. Although I’m still eating enough, I’m still heavily restricting. I eat pretty much the exact same things every day, never daring to try something new, still counting calories (real calories, not the lies my parents know) and still can’t get out of the ashamed mentality that I have for eating.

I just despise myself for what I’m wasting when all my parents are trying to do is help me in every way they can.

I should preface this by saying that I’ve been in recovery for 3 years now (following 6 years of my ED) but still have body dysmorphia and low-level restriction compulsions; I try not to look at my body or shop for clothes, as this is a trigger for me.

I can’t postpone or change the date to cope with these issues, as we already purchased airline tickets and my family is flying in from a different state to shop with us.

473,EatingDisorders,"Hello,


I have an 11 year old daughter who has a limited number of foods she will eat. It has been like this since she was 2. Over the years the list has changed but has been very, very limited. She has an extreme fear of trying new food. I thought she would grow out of it, her doctor and dietician thought the same but if this is an eating disorder I want to get her the help she needs now. The wait list for her to speak with a counsellor/therapist is long where I live so I need to get on this but I can’t figure out if it falls in the category. 


I do apologize if this post offends anyone as I know that there are much more serious disorders out there and this might seem trivial but I’ve tried everything I can think of including “Eat what I make or eat nothing at all” and that results in her eating nothing at all for several days. 

If this is an ED and it has a name could someone kindly point me in the right direction so that I may begin research to help my girl?

474,EatingDisorders,"Hello everyone,

I’ve never posted here before and haven’t been able to find anything in the sub about the specific issue I am going through. So both my friend and I have eating disorders. Her disorder is more severe than mine so I have always made it a priority to not engage in behaviors/talk about things that may be triggering to her. However, recently I don’t think she is doing the same for me. I’ve recently noticed that in Snapchat she is clearly sending me photos where she is body checking and showing off the weight she lost (also including numbers) specifically choosing angles that show the size of her waist etc. I love having a friend who gets what I’m going through and understands having issues with food but I can’t help but wonder if it’s doing more harm than good. Is anyone else dealing with something similar?

475,EatingDisorders,"I have had a control-related ED since I was a child. It helps me soothe myself and at this point is mostly a habit I can’t stop. I’m 30. 
I can tell my body is suffering. I’m sick a lot, exhausted a lot and very likely have a vitamin or electrolyte deficiency. 

I want to get help but I don’t want to disclose to my doctor in specific terms what behaviour I’ve been engaged in. I have an appointment to see him tomorrow and I’m hoping I can get a blood test, even though I’m scared that if I do have (as I suspect) a severe electrolyte or deficiency, I’ll be interrogated and I’ll have to confess. 

On one hand, I’m scared to get found out because I feel deeply guilty and ashamed for damaging my body. That’s the central thing. I’m caught up in self-blame and I’m ashamed that I’ve been hurting myself. I know it’s a psychological problem of mental health, but I feel like I should be able to just stop and I feel guilty for not taking care of myself and of the reality that I’ve done actual irreversible damage . On the other hand, I can tell that I need medical attention and that I can’t go on like this. The childhood-esque fear of getting in trouble for doing a bad thing to my body is so strong that I have avoided getting medical help all these years. I’m scared that ultimately, shame will prevent me from getting help. I ignore my body’s symptoms often because I can’t handle the guilt and shame and I want to pretend it’s not happening. But it is 😔

The only person I have told is my previous therapist, who moved away and I can’t see anymore. Due to the shame, I could tell her that the problem existed but we never worked through it. I was too afraid and overwhelmed to actually discuss it.

I have a new therapist who I haven’t told. I’m seeing her on Thursday.  Since things are pretty bad mentally, I’m thinking of disclosing (in the same vague terms as I used with my old therapist) to her. I’m worried that telling her (or even getting blood tests done) will overwhelm me. 

Tl dr; too ashamed and guilty to let medical professionals help me. How do I overcome this?

Much bloating, lots of skin breakout, dizzyness, bad performance during workouts, and I also haven’t got my period this month which I think could be linked to the diet. (I have lost my period a couple more times in the past during my ED and in early recovery.)
I didn’t start this diet to lose much weight, since I’m already on a healthy weight and I haven’t weighted myself in years in order not to trigger my old ED. I only wanted to shred off some excess fat around my belly for summer.
But during this diet I have found it to be much much harder to get full after a meal and I usually eat a second plate or I come back to the kitchen for snacks very quickly.
Since I’m not getting carbs I can not measure how much I’m supposed to be eating cause it’s so different than what I’m used to. So at first I thought I wasn’t eating enough, then I started eating more and now I fear that I might adopt to a binge eating habit and I really don’t want to get another ED after five years of recovery.

478,EatingDisorders,"I hate going to the doctor. I honestly refuse to unless it's reached a critical point. I live in America, I need to be dying before the cost is worth it. My point is I ignore problems I deem 'small' or something I can live with (to be honest this is a whole healthcare talk that needs to be had just not now or here).

So here I am sitting at plates of food I know I like and I can't tolerate it past a certain point. Things I've noted:

1. My mood can cause it to (and by it I mean the ability to just be unable to eat, trying to anyway makes me nauseous and queazy)
2. Other times my mood has no relation to it. I can be happy and unable to finish something.
3. Yes I do feel hunger. And I do eat but I will stop suddenly feeling full despite only taking one bite
4. It can happen for weeks or just once or twice a day.
5. I rarely throw up over it but it's possible if I become gluttonous and consume even when queazy kicks in.
6. I don't hate food at all. I just don't like it either unless it's what I'm craving

Now why am I not asking a doctor? They cost money. And if I want help they will consistently cost money. I can live with this. I only dip my toe in the dangerous area (occasional spells of dizziness, low energy, trouble sleeping, late periods). I'll survive and I'll either always be xxx or I'll slowly gain weight.

479,EatingDisorders,"I'm (16f) writing this post because I really need help as to how I should tell my friends (16f) we'll call 'C' parents about her eating disorder. Here's the backstory:

At the beginning of last year while school was still running normally, I noticed C rarely ate anything at lunch. She made excuses for why she didn’t do so and she would also be frequently looking at dieting posts and ‘healthy’ meals on instagram. Even before this began, I always noticed how she constantly looked at calories before eating anything. This behaviour worried me, but I never brought it up to her. A little while later, she confessed to me that she was throwing up everything she ate. I knew this was an eating disorder and she told me not to tell anyone, but I was very concerned and debated how I could have told her parents what was going on without revealing my identity. In the end, I didn’t end up telling them. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I’m not kidding you making that decision would be it. If I had told her parents right away I could have saved her so much pain and I feel so much regret for not doing so. Fast forward a couple months when we were talking one day and she told me that she told her dad everything that was going on, how she was throwing up her food and that now they went on grocery trips together and bought (what she perceived was) healthy foods that she would eat. I trusted she was telling the truth because she is super close to her dad. I was so happy that she had told him and I thought this would be the first steps towards her recovery. Although she should be able to eat anything without feeling guilty or feeling like she needed to throw it up, whether that be ‘healthy’ or ‘junk’ foods, not just with ‘healthy’ foods. I was just so happy that she was eating. I thought everything was going well until a few months ago when one day on our walk she told me that she wanted to start working out. I told her to take it very slow and to make sure she was fuelling herself with food and water so she could have lots of energy. She often made negative comments about herself and how she hates her body so I was a bit worried she would develop unhealthy habits but if she started slow, I thought she would be okay. In the past few months, I have noticed she has lost a significant amount of weight which is not something I would usually comment on but I think it’s important to bring up here. It has been so drastic that even my mom has asked me if she is okay. A couple months ago, she told me she hadn’t gotten her period in 5 months which I knew was a sign of under-eating and not getting enough nutrients in her body so this made me worried that she wasn’t eating at all or she was not eating enough. The last time we saw each other, she told me she still hadn’t gotten it and it had now been 7 months. That same day she told me that she works out for 2 hours which really shocked me! This is an excessive amount of time to be working out so I am really worried she is under-eating and over-exerting herself. She also said to me (something along the lines of) “If my thighs were as small as my calves everything would be fine.” I’m really worried about what kind of habits she has developed and I think they are affecting her physical health in a very negative way. 

I cannot put into words the amount of regret I feel for not having told her parents when she first told me. A couple weeks ago I wrote a letter that I was planning on emailing to her parents from a fake email address that basically mentions everything I said above. I saw her again today as she came over with her mom and sister and the entire time I was thinking about the letter and literally felt like I was going to throw up because I was so guilty and nervous and as soon as she left I went to my room and cried and was shaking (I know this sounds way overdramatic but I feel so guilty every time I think about her or talk to her or her parents).

A few days ago she also informed me that she spent 2 hours at the doctors and that she had to follow up with him. She didn't tell me much about it but when I tried asking her about it she didn't want to talk about it, so of course I didn't push. I have no idea if it has anything to do with this but I'm starting to think it might. 

Anyway, I really want to tell her parents everything I know, but I don't know how. Should I send them the email? My mom and her mom are really good friends so should I tell my mom and have her tell her mom? Or should I meet with her in person (it's probably the best way but I'm so scared she's going to hate me for not telling her earlier which is stupid cause I should be putting my friends health before my feelings). Sorry for the super long post I just really need help on what to do please I just want to do what's best for her but I'm so stressed about how to do this.

I’ve lost a chunk of my weight in the last few months and my therapist and psychiatrist especially are worried, my medical doctors are somewhat worried but my labs are fine so they’re convinced if I drop more weight it’s anorexia. I’ve struggled with food my whole life but mostly just being picky, that being said as a kid I was NEVER underweight once I was about 10.

483,EatingDisorders,"I spent 25 years in the grip of an ED. I had a lot of treatment, some good and some not great. After my last hospitalization something really did click the way that everyone always hopes it will. For the last 4-5 years I have been steadily doing better and better. I have to be very vigilant still, and I'm very aware that some parts of my recovery process have been basically against all medical and psychiatric advice. For example, part of my success has been releasing myself from feeling like I need to depend on doctors, therapists, or medication. NOTE: I do not recommend this for anyone else. I have occasionally tried to find a therapist, but without much success and honestly it has felt very freeing and empowering 95% of the time.  I'm in my late 30s now and I recently took the step of re-entering the medical system to try and establish a care relationship with a primary care doc. I'm confident that my health is the best it has ever been, but I don't want to be in an emergency or chronic situation in any aspect of health and have to scramble to find someone.  At the doctor's visit, I asked for my weight to be recorded backwards and for the medical assistant who took it not to tell me the number. She didn't and was very respectful about it. But then, the weight was ALL OVER the screen showing my chart and history while the doctor went through it all with me. Like, she was discussing my history of anorexia while 6 inches away my weight was right there in 36 font. It was also on the print-out they gave me after the visit.  I liked her otherwise and will probably continue. I have managed to head off a tailspin but am having to do a lot of managing that I wish I didn't have to do, now that I know that number that I haven't seen in 5 years.

484,EatingDisorders,"Hi all. I am very overwhelmed and want the best for my partner but his health is concerning and I feel out of my depth. 

My partner has an ED that involves both restricting/purging and recently it got so bad that his health was declining. I read up on some studies that essentially scared me, particularly with purging, and we tried to establish some healthy boundaries together that would keep him safe.

Here's where it gets messy:
His therapist had just offered him a treatment program that took months to be approved for-- by the time he was approved, he had just been hired for a new job. He couldn't do both, he'd have to quit his job to do this 2 month program. At the time he told me he was doing better with his ED and I said the decision was up to him-- if he felt he was OK then I felt that it was also important to have a stable income since he was having a hard time finding a job after the pandemic. 

Except I found out that he'd been lying to me about how bad it was and it was serious enough that we got into an argument because I'm so afraid for his health. I found out his therapist left him because he refused to take the program. If I had known how bad it was, I would have encouraged him to take the program and I'd support him financially as much as possible. I don't know what to do, because he realizes it's bad but he sounds more concerned about reaching his ""goal weight"" before going into treatment. He's upset about the idea of gaining in treatment, and I've tried to be supportive but I feel like I'm sitting by and letting his ED consume him. He said he doesn't want to be like this anymore but I sometimes feel like I'm being gaslit by his disorder when he's convincing me ""it's not that bad"" or ""I've only been restricting this much for x days"", etc.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to micromanage, I've tried to make all his triggers easier by helping plan grocery lists and getting groceries for him, making sure he always has ""safe food"" available, exercising together so he doesn't overdo it (another issue he has). I remind him all the time how much I love him and any little progress he DOES do I am quick to acknowledge and support. 

Is there anything else i can do? I'm stressed out but I fear if I don't try to help more I will be complicit in his self-harm. I've been trying to seek therapy, so I know that is one thing I can be doing for myself. Thank you all. :(",,Request: Struggling with my Partner's Recent Behavior.

486,EatingDisorders,"Hey all, I'm looking for a bit of advice if you would be so kind. So my mom has always been into fitness, she used to run marathons, but lately it has become a borderline obsession. She noticed around this time last year that she had put on a little bit of weight, nothing major but she decided to dive into fitness. She is a 5' 3"" 47 year old woman and she started off weighing about xxx pounds (normal weight)  and didn't like the way she looked. Now almost exactly a year later she weighs yyy pounds (much less) and she is still obsessively logging everything she eats into a calorie counter, and she works out every single day. She will get home from a 12 hour day of work and run 5 miles or do like a P90X style workout. She is also training to climb a mountain, so she will regularly walk/hike like 17 miles a day on her days off of work  and then do another actual workout later. I am starting to get kind of concerned that all of this working out combined with the eating and calorie counting might have developed into something a bit more serious, like an eating disorder but I don't really have any experience with this, and I don't wanna like approach her and seem like accusatory or make her self conscious if there's no reason to so I guess I'm asking, do you think I have reason to worry and if so how do you think I should go about addressing it?

this has made me so so stressed, the recent weight loss has made my hair fall more frequently and i deal with a mood instability that makes me mentally drained all the time (idk what this, if it's a mental illness or not because i've never seen a therapist) and overall it just makes everything harder, but since i've never experienced bulimia or have been diagnosed as anorexic i can't really tell if i'm being a fraud or if i should actually try to work my mental set to go get some professional help, but like i said this has been frequent since my early teen days and i learned early about some eating disorder terms and habits thanks to tumblr, but the only thing I have tried has been fasting and drinking only water for as long as i possibly can.

Quarantine however let me have the time to regularly exercise and diet which helped me to lose a good amount of weight in a few months. I didn’t realize then but realized later that I was restricting myself way too much and justifying it by saying “if you want results, you gotta work for it”. And I would binge a lot on cheat days. I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that’s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn’t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college.

Hi beautiful people! I'm a 21F looking for advice in a world that seems to have no answers. A little bit of background: I have struggled with disordered eating for a big chunk of my life but I have been committed to recovery for over 3 years now. I love the peace that recovery has brought, and I'm very scared of losing it. Nevertheless, I'm at my highest weight ever and while it doesn't necessarily bother me, all I can think of when I look in the mirror is of how my fat phobic friends and family perceive me. They make comments about how much better I looked before, and I feel the urge to go back to those behaviors just to be more visually pleasing. It might be all in my head, but I feel unsafe in this bigger body in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?

494,EatingDisorders,"Help. I went to the doctor because, to be honest, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now, and my lack of interest in eating has spiraled out of control. Don't get me wrong, as a kid, yes, I was picky, but I loved to eat. I would binge eat like crazy. All I wanted to do my whole life was gain weight. But when I was 18 I had an illness causing stomach ulcers which made it unbearable to eat. I would take a few bites and clutch my abdomen in pain. My new doctor thinks this may have caused me to develop a negative association with food in my brain which has persisted even though the pain is gone. 
Things did get a little easier in time after the ulcers went away, but when I was 21 I went through a pretty awful breakup and I've been gradually losing weight since. Now I'm 23, 5'6' and only xxx lbs (underweight bmi)  which must be my lowest weight since middle school. I basically starve myself until 4pm, then eat just enough to get myself through the night, and I despise exercise which is just sad as I've been an athlete my whole life. 
The depression and anxiety started when I was roughly 16 I'd say, but it's been the hardest in the past year or so. Last July I found myself having suicidal fantasies, so I started counseling briefly, until suddenly I felt it wasn't worth anything. Shortly after, I found myself in situations I had never been in before. I was a SB here and there and even flew to Vegas spontaneously with a girlfriend. I ran up my credit card bill, and developed intense feelings for her at the time, but felt so much shame at the end of all this that I isolated for a solid month. I keep going in and out of these cycles and patterns in my life, and I feel like I'm constantly slipping (but honestly it's like I never really came back to myself). I don't know where to begin or end with all this. There's been so much, I don't know when the unraveling started or when I started starving myself.
My doctor thinks I have an undiagnosed eating disorder, though she confirmed it isn't anything basic like anorexia or bulimia. She wants to start me on a mild dose of Paroxetine until I can get into counseling to sort all this out. I'm worried about the side effects and I'm worried about the withdrawals. I have a new guy in my life, and I don't want any loss of libido, but also, I don't want to crash into depression again when we inevitably end.

495,EatingDisorders,"When I was 16, I lost a significant amount of weight in one summer that I have not been able to gain back since (I am now 20). I think it might have been a mixture of SAT-studying stress, pre-college stress, my toxic family, and maybe my dance teachers calling me fat (I wasn’t big by non-dancer standards, but, you know). My doctors have always treated it as anorexia because I’m so underweight, they face me away from the scale when they measure me and don’t tell me the numbers. And my weight becomes the object of every visit which is so annoying. My doctor tells me I am “clinically anorexic.”

I don’t THINK I have a problem with food. I never think about calories or anything. I even look forward to eating good meals. But I find that although I’m hungry, I can’t get myself to eat even half a plate before my appetite is gone. I feel full but not really, just that if I eat any more, I won’t keep it down. On top of that, I am constantly nauseous when I wake up in the morning and sometimes throughout the day at any time of the month. Sometimes I throw up for no reason.

I don’t know if I subconsciously have a problem with food or my body image? Or maybe it’s just anxiety? But this problem persists regardless of my mental state.

498,EatingDisorders,"Dear users,

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for some advice, potentially a few people to support each other while recovering from eating disorders. Little bit about me, I was 14 when I first began purging and since then I have had an on again off again relationship with it. My weight has ranged from underweight to overweight and currently I am still overweight. I’ve tried to seek help numerous times for recovery and support, I do have other mental health issues including autism, depression and potential borderline personality disorder. I’m currently on antidepressants and I have been for two years now; however I do not feel like I am equipped to make healthy choices with food. I feel like I either go between over eating and bingeing, sometimes purging or being far too restrictive. What I would like to do is get to a point where I’m eating to nourish my body and not just focusing every moment on what to do and what to eat next. I’m aware that my eating and what I put into my body is massively linked to my mental state. However I would love to get to the point where I am not emotionally eating all of the time. I’m in my late 20s and I would love to find a relationship and settle down in the next few years and I hate the idea that I might potentially influence my children in the future. I would love to learn how to carefully choose my food nourish myself and enjoy what I’m eating.

499,EatingDisorders,"So I’ve never been diagnosed with an ED because I’ve never sought treatment before now, but I’ve struggled with both restriction and over exercising, as well as binge eating. Last year it was binge eating and then I was working on unrestricted eating which helped for a while, but then I started restricting again and was feeling really stuck mentally. 

So I got a therapist who, despite asking for an eating disorder specialist, is not one. The first thing she told me was to choose a goal to work on (her examples included a goal weight or BMI, I said I just wanted to feel stronger again and I don’t use a scale, but I’m having a hard time not thinking about weightloss 24/7) Her using those examples has really freaked me out and when I brought that up she said I could lose weight in a healthy way, I just don’t know how yet. She said it may be unrealistic for me to be happy at my current weight if I don’t feel good in my body, and if I lose weight it will help me feel better because I’ve accomplished a goal.

But lately I’ve been having such a hard time eating. It’s been messing with my sleep cause I get too hungry, but I don’t want to eat. I hate eating and making food, I hate even thinking about food. I want to lose weight but I’m gaining weight and feeling sick all the time because I’m too hungry. 

I just don’t know if this therapist is a good fit, I kind of feel like I need a higher level of care but I don’t know how to ask for that. I hate that I asked for ED treatment and all I got was two appointments a month with someone who doesn’t specialize in EDs. This is my first time asking for help and I don’t really know what to do. I don’t even know if she’s right and it just doesn’t make sense to me because I’ve never lost weight in a healthy way.

500,EatingDisorders,"Hi all. I was home with my 62-year-old mother for a good chunk of the pandemic, and being with her made me start to wonder if she has an eating disorder.

She's a small, thin woman. She's exceptionally active despite rheumatoid arthritis - walks a few miles everyday and rides a stationary bike every morning. She doesn't eat much throughout the day but usually has large dinners, and throughout the pandemic she's been snacking more and more late at night.

There are a few signs that point to her having potentially binged and purged in my childhood, which I never recognized til now. Going to the bathroom after dinner, always chewing gum. I guess you don't always see that stuff when you're growing up.

We're from the midwest, and I've been open about being in therapy / taking anti-anxiety meds, but there's still such stigma around mental health. I want to talk to her about it, but I'm not certain how to ask. 

I've seen resources on how to talk to a loved one, but I'm especially nervous because it's my mom (and she's in her 60s). I don't have any definitive proof, but I'm worried. Is this something I should let go? How do you talk to someone a little later in life?

I have a friend who I have been friends with for over 25 years now. We were best friends for a long time and now we aren’t as close as before, we are definitely still friends that check in on each other now and again. For the sake of this, I am going to call my friend Amy. She had a pretty intense eating disorder in the past that almost landed her in the hospital from the age of 15-18. She thankfully had recovered and did outpatient care and therapy. She is someone who of course still feels the remnants of that ED and also deals with anxiety and depression. The past couple years she has been really candid online about her struggles and also her improvements and self-love. She really has seemed to be doing so much better and grown so much. I am so happy for her.

Although, recently I’ve noticed online that her weight has dropped off and I’m really concerned she might not be eating again. I’ve heard her mom is concerned as well. She recently just went through a break up so I wouldn’t be surprised if that sparked it. I’ve had talks with her about how she’s doing and she seems to be honest but hasn’t mentioned issues with her body image. Online she seems to be confident in her skin. I’m really not sure if I’m looking into it too much because hey! Weight fluctuates! It’s hard because we don’t live in the same place so I can’t be witness to her behaviours in life, I can only analyze what I see online. I also don’t know her close friends. I don’t want to comment on anything about her appearance because I know how destructive that can be in many ways. She is also a VERY sensitive person, it’s completely understandable and I don’t mean this in a bad way, it’s just very hard to bring up sensitive topics to her. I am just honestly concerned about her and I want to make sure she’s okay and that this is a natural fluctuation and not intentional.

505,EatingDisorders,"I’ve (F27) had a pattern of what I think would be considered ED behavior since I was in high school, and I’ve been horribly aware of my weight and body shape since elementary school. I’ve always thought I was fat, even though logically I know I am not. I first started barely eating around my sophomore year because I felt like I had lost control of my surroundings, my dad was extremely strict and religious and violated my trust and privacy boundaries a lot (ex: we had a family meeting where he took my diary and read out of it and lectured me on being “impure” for wanting to make out with a boy), and stupidly, was upset about said boy. 

Ever since then I have fallen into the pattern of severely reducing my food intake whenever I am experiencing rejection in my romantic relationships, which has always been in the form of them being unfaithful or lying or both (I am now married and this is happening, I feel trapped). Occasionally other forms of stress will trigger it too, if it’s intense enough. When I see my body start to slim down, or my tummy flatten it only fuels me, because I attach my worth to how I appear, because if I’m pretty enough maybe I’ll be good enough to be the only person my significant other wants. 

At this point I don’t know how to stop, it feels like something I can’t control, my body does not crave food and when I try to eat I feel extremely physically ill and can’t eat normal portions, everything disgusts me except certain comfort junk foods. Sometimes I use thc to boost my appetite which helps but I do not enjoy being dependent on a substance just to eat. I don’t want to take antidepressants to boost my appetite either. 

I am fully aware of all of the horrors with health that comes with this kind of behavior. I am fully aware of WHY I am doing this. But it almost feels like I just don’t care, I just cannot stop, like I deserve it, like I’m not worthy of food or love because everyone I’ve ever loved has shown me that. It also feels like I have a sick sense of kinship with this behavior, like this is all I have to make things better, like it’s the oldest and closest friend I have. I acknowledged openly with people that I didn’t eat in high school but I can’t seem to label myself as having an eating disorder now, because I don’t know if I actually do or ever did, if that makes sense?

I (f 23)am 5'8 and currently xxx lbs (significantly underweight BMI). I was almost in the normal range a little over a year ago. I can tell im losing weight and I've already been to the doctor. She took some blood and a stool sample to send to the lab but I haven't received my results yet. I guess im posting because I've been having really low self esteem, my clothes don't fit, I feel tired and weak, and ugly, im incredibly unmotivated. 

Could this be more of a mental issue than a physical one? I know im hungry, I can feel that my stomach is empty and it hurts but it doesn't motivate me to eat. I get up and make food and the second I put it in my mouth I want to throw up. I was having some issues about two years ago where I couldn't keep certain food down, meats, spices, certain vegetables, and nuts. They never figured out what it was. I would eat and immediately throw up or have to use the restroom. Could this all be related? Does any of this sound like something you have experienced?

 I'm losing it, my mind that is. I feel like I'm going crazy and losing all this weight and don't know how to stop. Can anyone recommend anything they ate or drank to gain weight safely? Specific protein shakes? Certain meals? Any tricks or tips and advice would be appreciated.

 Hi, I'm a 21 year old male who has been struggling with quite severe  anorexia and bulimia for at least 4-5 years now. I've recently gotten a  LOT better in recovery and just kind of now noticing the strange ways in  which my body has kind of stayed in the adolescent stage (if that makes  any sense). I got my hormones checked out and they are all normal, my  testosterone was even above average as I've been working towards a  normal weight, eating better and lifting. Almost normal weight but still  kind of small and almost boy-ish looking. 

But my main concern is that my beard development is at the same stage  it was before I got my ED around age 15. That is, my beard hasn't been  growing since and it has been hitting my confidence quite hard. My male  relatives on both sides can all grow more or less some sort of beard and  I just wonder if this damage is reversible?

512,EatingDisorders,"Im a 22 year old woman. I’m a healthy weight currently, but I haven’t eaten more than a (small) meal a day in the past month. I’m not scared to eat, it’s just that the thought of eating food makes me so nauseous that I can’t do it. I only eat at dinner time when I’m so hungry that I can actually eat without nausea. 

Right around quarantine I gained weight like never before and got stretch marks from the weight gain. I’ve been more concerned with my weight this year then ever before, I constantly feel fat and I was swinging in and out of diets and exercising routines from July2020 to March2021. The nausea issue is new, I just... can’t eat. I can’t even sleep now because I’m not eating. I can only sleep after I’ve been awake for ~36 hours.

The part that is freaking me out the most is that I weigh myself several times a day since the nausea issue and I often find myself happy with the weight it caused me to lose. Sometimes if it makes me feel really good about myself I’ll skimp on the one meal a day that I can actually stomach. 

About 3 months ago, I was on my most restrictive diet with calorie counting. I knew it was on the low side, but I thought I couldn’t meet my weight goal unless I did it. Sometimes I found myself wishing I had the willpower to suffer through an Ed for a couple months to lose the weight. I stopped the dieting and exercising in since the end of March because I was worried it was becoming obsessive. But I know I did not will myself into the nausea issue, it just started happening and it hasn’t gone away.

I genuinely hope this isn’t insensitive, I just want to be honest about my feelings towards this issue in hopes of getting good advice.

Hello ! 

I barely eat, have seen a doctor but didn't get news after only a blood test since 3 weeks now... What should I do next ? I'm really lost...
Should I go take a new appointements ? (Each visit at the clinic, we get a new random doc anyway)
I dont want to bother... And I'm affraid it will be all the same and I would get no news or they say I have nothing....


Long post for more info

So since 4 or 5 months I barely eat even one full meal a day. I've lost my appetite, but I still feel hungry to the point my stomach hurt and I double over waiting for it to pass...

The question of if I'm hungry is hard for me to answer... I have DPDR so I feel very detached from my body while still being in it, so I say that my stomach feel hungry as it hurt me... But there is no more food that I want/make me feel hungry. Maybe raspberry ! They are still very yummy to me... But mostly everything else ""disgust"" me, while it is food that I like !! I really don't understand...
My psychiatrist suggested me ARFID, and it made me realise that it's something I've always had but was hard to describe so I have just tagged as Picky Eater... But still my whole life my ARFID was manageable, now it's just out of control !!!! And I did loose my appetite as I miss meal without feeling hungry, and when I do feel hungry it's too late now ._. food became hard to take
But then, genius I am, I tried to eat even if I wasnt feeling hungry!... It don't work much, I do it still, ofcourse I try to eat... But I'm just putting food in the trash at the end because it dont want to pass my lips and if I do force it, and start to masticate and taste and then... I slow down and I'm not able to swallow. Like, I tried to swallow. And it give my throat the reflex to puke, so it's really hard to force, so like yeah I could force myself everytime I eat... What a life it would be 😞

when it all started, I was still feeling hungry for real, it started with only some food that would not want to pass my lips or just thinking about it maked me sick (but it was still food that I normally liked a lot!) And it seemed to change day to day for some food, like one day I couldnt swallow cucumber or chicken, but the next day ? No problem.
And I didnt look much into it at first
But then it became problematic, because the only food that I was able to swallow was pancake with chocolate ... Only that
For lunch
For diner
Everyday
Oh it was very delicious ! And I eated as much to be satisfied, would you say that it's healthy or normal for a human being to survive only on pancake of chocolate and nothing else ? 
At the end, it maked me sick too. It wasn't surprising, eating so much of one thing can only make sick.

And now it's more hard then ever to find something that I will be able to eat and swallow...

😞 I talk with my psychiatrist once a month, so ofcourse each month since it started I tell her "" I'm hungry, but I'm not able to eat, what should I do ?"" And each time becoming more distressfull ! But all she can do is tell me to go see a doctor... And I finally did see a doctor at a clinic ! And he touched my neck, said to lay down, touched my belly, asked if it hurted, said many mh, said well we gonna do a blood test, also look if you might be pregnant.... (Mind you, I have still my periods without a change, have a contraception aaaand... After 5 months wouldnt I know if I was pregnant ?!)


But that was 4 week ago now... The test was done and they still didn't call me back...
Look, I know I was already enduring the starvation since 5 months, and testing blood take time I know..... But still ?? Some news?? Some checkup?? Atleast he could have gived me some advice on how to take care of my body, what I could try to eat 😞 That's what I think...

I really feel bad to take another appointment and bother them again with my problem...
Should I try my luck again ?

515,EatingDisorders,"**Major TW for talking in-depth about behaviors (no #s)**

I've struggled with disordered eating my entire life, as a result of my parents who shamed my sister for gaining weight in college and her expressing disordered thoughts to me--when I got to high school I also got comments that I was gaining weight from my parents, and it really started to spiral in me (I'd skip meals, look at myself and identify the areas of myself I didn't like). Flash forward to 4 months ago, my first college semester on-campus and I would skip some meals, overeat others, and constantly feel bad about my body. The guy I dated briefly then did make a lot of comments to me when I would bring up my weight insecurities: ""you know, the only way to be skinny is to eat less"" ""come work out with me"" ""what do you expect when you're eating all that junk at the dining hall""...yeah that combined with ""you're so fat you've gained so much weight"" when my parents visited me mid-semester kind of put the nail in the coffin. 

I'm an average weight, on the lower side. But I can't help thinking I need to lose weight. I need to. Even if I don't think fat is a bad thing. Even if I see fat people as just as worth life and food as skinny people. And because it's only been a few months of actual restriction/binge cycles, my brain tells me I don't need help since I'm not actually diagnosed and not deathly skinny to the point where I need hospitalization. But at the same time, I'm miserable, I can't not calorie count, I eat half of the minimum calorie intake people should have most of the time, I'm obsessed with body-checking, weighing myself, and crying in the mirror. I don't know what to do, but I'm scared to eat, I'm scared to gain the weight that I've already lost. I simultaneously want to like food but I also need to get worse. 

I'm so afraid that it's too late, I can't just start eating again. I don't even know if it's an actual ED since it hasn't been that long. I'm losing faith in food so, so quickly and today my mother weighed herself on the scale, said her weight (lower than mine), and then proceeded to call herself fat. I had just eaten more than I usually do, and I almost had a breakdown over it. My mom saying that just made me spiral, and I'm thinking of going to extremes tomorrow to lose the weight I gained.

517,EatingDisorders,"
I'm a male, turning 25, in Australia. (If that info helps.)

Hey guys and girls, never thought I'd be in a place like this.

I started my behaviours around 2 years ago, but they became really extreme around last year, limiting calories by a substantial amount, then to purging when I felt I went a little (what I deem ""suitable""/safe, ""safe"" as in not to rupture or damage my throat) over that amount, I have purged large amounts, but I have to do it in secret and the longer I'm gone from my usual places the more questions are asked. So I only purge when I'm a little over my lowly calorie limit, when I binge a lot of food, I just leave it and become very agitated and filled with guilt. 

So last year I began purging, at first it was once or twice a week, then at one stage it was once a day for a fortnight. Then it ""died"" down to once or twice a month from then on. I thought I could keep it around that number. Until last month... I started doing it almost every day again, I did it everyday for a fortnight then it's ""died"" down to 4-5 times a week now. 

I want to tell the professionals I see, to see if they can help, but I don't want them to tell my family, I live with my family and I'm turning 25 this year. I'm just asking here if anyone has input in whether they'll tell my family, or just general advice? It's gotten quite extreme, the purging and the calorie limit (I admit, the calorie limit has improved very slightly, I let myself eat like 20% more calories now compared to last month.) 

I honestly thought I could control this, but it's getting more uncontrollable than I could imagine. I'm slightly overweight, so they might not treat it as serious, that's what I'm thinking any ways. 

The purging made me feel like a living being, but then quickly dulled in that sensation, I'm ""on-paper"" diagnosed  with schizophrenia, which isn't doing very well for me, mostly long term negative symptoms are kicking my ass. I've been in mental health treatment for about 5 years, and I don't want to be that client/patient that keeps going downhill, but I can't help it.",,Request: Can you guys post this? looking for advice on how to reduce/curb feeding behaviours,2,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,npq8a1,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/npq8a1/request_can_you_guys_post_this_looking_for_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/npq8a1/request_can_you_guys_post_this_looking_for_advice/,1622540849,390,0,0,0,-1,1,Purging and limiting calories,harmful,"Purging has become more frequent and extreme, now happening 4-5 times a week, Worried about seeking professional help because they do not want family to know, Feeling out of control and unable to manage their eating disorder","Extreme calorie restriction and purging behaviors, fear of professionals telling family",harmful,"Behaviors have become more uncontrollable over time, Living with family and fear of them finding out, Diagnosed with schizophrenia and experiencing long-term negative symptoms",Extreme calorie restriction and purging behaviors,harmful,"Behaviors started around 2 years ago and became more extreme last year, Purging has become more frequent, occurring almost every day for a period of time, The writer is struggling to control their behaviors and is seeking advice on how to get help without involving their family, The writer has a pre-existing diagnosis of schizophrenia that is impacting their mental health"
518,EatingDisorders,"Before anyone has a go at me I feel SO STUPID. If anything this is embarrassing for me, I just feel like crying. For the last 8 months or so I've been struggling with an eating disorder. It started out as bulimia, but futher into the new year things only got worse and I eventually ended up losing A LOT of weight in a very short period of time.
Eventually my mum started to get on my ass about it. As well aware of my isssues I am, I continue to live in constant denial. I don't know why- I just can't bring myself to admit to anyone that maybe I'm not doing to great. I always end up dismissing it, or getting irritated.
Anyhow- my mum, obviously caring about me booked me in for a check-up with my GP. This is were things get a bit messy. I don't know what possessed me to make such a dumb decision but it happened nonetheless. Without going into how I actually did this- prior to my appointment I managed to attached x kgs worth of weights to myself. Looking back on it now I'm kicking myself... but it gets worse. Upon weighing me with the weights, it showed that I was on the smaller side or whatever but nothing of concern- I was thinking great I got away with it blah blah blah.
Jokes on me I had a follow-up appointment just a month later. I couldn't just show up having lost x kgs, so once again I repeated that horrendous idea with the weights plus an extra kilo just in case... jokes on me I had still managed to go down on the scale... HOW EVEN? 
At this point I'm being referred to plenty of places and I am happy that I might perhaps get the help I need- however none of these people know I'm significantly lighter than my records have. How can I go about telling my doctor this?

520,EatingDisorders,"I don’t know what kind of advice to ask for here, but I need to know I’m not alone. I’ve dealt with some disordered eating habits for a few years now, specifically food avoidance and starvation related stuff. I typically have a good grip on these issues any given day as long as I don’t have to face potential triggers. Welp, about seven months ago I got Covid and lost my sense of smell and taste. That was fine for the most part; I had to battle a lack of appetite (it’s a lot easier to not eat when eating isn’t enjoyable), but after maybe three weeks I fully recovered and my taste came back (smell was still gone, rip.) all fine and dandy, cool, whatever. That is, until about three/four months ago, when my smell came back sour and my taste suddenly turned completely rotten, which leads me to today.

My smell and taste have hit a total road block in recovery. It’s just not happening. For the past four months I’ve had to avoid meat and other forms of protein, along with all of my quick breakfast and lunch foods. Snacking and sweets don’t exist for me anymore, I started having to skip out on dinner and find my own meals, which is a very limited pool for me to choose from, so a lot of times I just don’t try and I make myself go hungry. Even on days where I can stomach whatever is being cooked, walking into the kitchen is like walking into a wall of the smell of rotten meat and it just totally ruins my appetite and mood. I literally have to force feed myself most days. Sometimes I’ll cook something that was perfectly safe for me to eat the day before, only to take a bite and have to spit it out because it tastes so bad. It’s gotten to the point where the second I feel hungry, I get super anxious. 

I’ve basically gotten used to it. A few weeks ago I would have emotional breakdowns over it, but I’ve since learned some foods that I can rely on to be safe consistently. Thing is, it’s so few of them, and I’ve had a really hard time keeping variety in my diet because of it. I’m so sick of eating the same things every day, and I’ve found it a lot easier to convince myself to skip meals because of it. I just want my taste and smell back to normal, like I’m seriously so desperate. I saw one of my grandmothers for the first time in 8 years the other week and she made a chocolate cake that I couldn’t eat because chocolate tastes like vodka. I haven’t had a cup of coffee in months because it tastes like what I imagine literal poop tastes like. Peanut butter and honey sandwiches are one of my favorite foods but I haven’t had one in months because peanut butter tastes like dog shit smells. I’ve been surviving on blueberry oatmeal and chamomile tea for the past month. Do you know how much oatmeal you can eat in a week????? I have so much oatmeal and I’m sick of it and I just wanna WANT TO eat again :(",,Request: ED difficulties due to long-term Covid symptoms,30,,,,,Just message the mods. :),t5_2qpcj,no7lve,1,EDPostRequests,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/no7lve/request_ed_difficulties_due_to_longterm_covid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/no7lve/request_ed_difficulties_due_to_longterm_covid/,1622367102,546,0,0,0,-1,1,Losing sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Avoiding certain foods due to their taste and smell, leading to a limited diet and difficulty finding variety, Feeling anxious and having to force-feed oneself due to lack of appetite, Emotional breakdowns and skipping meals due to the difficulty of finding safe foods, Feeling desperate to regain normal sense of taste and smell",Loss of sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Severe reduction in appetite due to the unpleasant taste and smell of most foods, Limited food options and difficulty finding safe foods to eat, Anxiety and emotional distress around feeling hungry, Difficulty maintaining variety in diet and skipping meals",Loss of sense of smell and taste due to COVID-19,harmful,"Difficulty eating protein and other foods due to unpleasant taste and smell, Limited food choices causing lack of variety in diet, Anxiety and emotional distress related to feeling hungry, Forced to eat the same foods every day, leading to skipping meals"

I eat fine and am healthy weight. I like food that tastes good obviously but it's more like I eat to stay alive. Anyway, I have several things about food related things and eating that make me really anxious.

1. When people around me describe food they've had or start praising some food. Every word describing food makes me feel physically ill. For example when a coworker tells me she bought some sort of food/treat and proceeds to tell me ""It was so good/delicious/yummy"" ect. I get so angry but I just suck it up.

2. Disclaimer, I have nothing against heavier people. But I don't know why I get so anxious eating with heavier people. I feel like I am obligated to eat equal or bigger amount of food as that other person and it has to be equally as healthy/unhealthy. 

3. Eating noices. It was bearable before covid, but now that I have had to spend all my lunch breaks alone and haven't been exposed to all the sounds, I feel horrified of the idea of us being able to eat in the same space again. Everyone else seems so excited while I'm terrified of having to listen to the eating sounds. Also the motion of people's jaws and faces when they chew and swallow the food, I think it something about the repeatedness. I used to think I have misophonia but I realized all these other things can't be linked to that.

The severity of the illness and her weight have varied over the years, but it got especially problematic after the pandemic hit.

But... now I think she's crossed a line with some of the things she has said, she talked about how she ate dominos pizza and was contemplating on whether or not she should forcibly vomit it out of her, I remember the rage that overcame me when I heard that because I suffered with bulimia and it was one of the worst periods in my life...

Hello, Everyone!

I've never been diagnosed with an ED, but I'm curious if I have one developing, and I was wondering if you guy's could possibly give me some insight on the matter.

I've never been skinny, always on the ""chunky"" side. I was never bullied for my weight, but it's something I have always been very insecure about. A year ago I realized i gained alot, and was at my heaviest. I started intermittent fasting, lost some weight, and was feeling better, and it was never an issue. So Quarantine happened, and I gained some back. Well fast forward, I started intermittent fasting again, and I'm down to I would say an slightly above average weight? Idk, cuz I personally CAN NOT see a change in myself. i see the same person as before... blubber for days, but others have noticed, and keep giving me compliments. Saying ""you're looking so good!"" So i didn't before? ""What are you doing?! Omg, teach me your ways"" which in a sense makes me feel like they're envious of my weight loss (which i know sounds TERRIBLE, but that lowkey makes me feel good about myself), or people will make remarks about wanting to ""be my size"" which I'm not even that ""small"" when i look at myself?!

So to get to the point of this post, my intermittent fasting has turned into me just not eating some days, or if i do eat, i feel SO FUCKING GROSS and TERRIBLE that i just want to make myself throw up and cry. When i even think of eating lately, it makes me sad and disappointed in myself. I just want to be skinny. My boyfriend doesn't want me to lose anymore weight either, which sort of makes me mad. I'm not sure if i am going down an ED path, or if I'm just being too insecure about myself? I also don't want to tell my bf, friends, or family about this because i don't want them to try and make me eat more lol because i lowkey WANT this so i can be skinny, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE &amp; DOESN'T SEEM HEALTHY?!

Since young i have been fatshamed by a family member, even though i was at healthy weight. I became obsessed with my weight (however the weighing scale is now broken..) Its been a few years and i only eat one meal with a cup of milk on weekends (at home), however i am able to eat 3 meals at school (but no snacks) If given the choice, i would eat much lesser because i feel guilty eating, but my parents are strict and always forces me to eat full meals. Im not sure if i am just faking it because i think i am ok outside with friends etc, however there are instances where the sight of food made me cry and go into distress. Lately i keep having thoughts on purging too and im definitely not eating enough calories, sorry for messy post.. just in doubt of myself.. 
If it helps: i feel more stress at home than outside due to childhood issues, which may have contributed to it, but the thought of eating a snack to stop my hunger makes me sick and guilty.

526,EatingDisorders,"[ I've never posted in a Reddit community before, hopefully I do this correctly. Apologies in advance for the long vent post] CW - discussion of unhealthy eating habits, past abuse (mentioned briefly without detail)

Around 2018/2019 I was at an extremely high-point of stress in my life, and was eating very little. This negatively affected my health to the point where, when I finally did take a trip to my college's dining hall, I passed out in the middle of my food being prepared right in front of me. I can feel myself slowly regressing back to that point, isolating myself and feeling justified in treating myself badly, and I hate how closely I'm inching back towards that mindset. 

Currently I [20M] am taking a break from school and am unemployed (I have a job offer lined up that I'm really hoping works out for me, as I haven't been employed since August 2020 when I was forced to stop working while escaping my abusive household, and I've spent my time since recovering and seeking therapy). The issue surrounding food avoidance resurfaced for me a few months after settling into my new life, away from my abuse situation and in a shared apartment with roommates I care deeply for. I struggle with diagnosed anxiety, ADHD, major depressive disorder, and OCD, and these issues combined make it very difficult to motivate myself to eat, even when I know it's affecting my physical and mental health. My paranoia and anxiety has been at an all-time high again more recently for a multitude of reasons, and stress affects my appetite horribly. I also constantly battle with finding safe foods that I feel I can eat because of my ADHD, and in the past several months I've found myself unable to hyperfixate on any sort of food, which makes me feel completely unmotivated to attempt feeding myself at all. If it involves any sort of preperation I just won't eat, regardless of when I intend to eat said prepared meal. It feels like work that isn't worth it. I don't look forward to eating anything. The concept of just snacking makes me feel extremely guilty, like I'm doing something wrong and unhealthy when I graze, assuming I've actually gotten myself to snack on something without letting it go stale or moldy upon either no longer caring for said food or forgetting it exists entirely until it's too late. The only thing I actually enjoy consuming is coffee, which worsens my anxiety if it's the only thing I've had during the day, and it usually is. I feel guilty even adding more than a couple  drops of flavored creamer into my mug in the morning, as ingesting products with large amounts of sugar contribute hugely to my guilt surrounding food. 

At this point I can barely manage a meal a day, and if I have more than that it's usually a result of my roommates offering to buy me something, which only weighs heavier upon my ever-growing sense of guilt, especially when they often refuse to accept money to pay for my share of whatever dinner they've gotten delivered. I know their finances are only a little better than my own. It feels like I'm taking advantage of their kindness, or manipulating them into feeling bad and spending their hard-earned money on someone like me. I feel like I'm trapped in a horrible cycle. I'm always in a terrible mood and feel unbearable to be around. I've started isolating myself again. I'm sure my eating habits are a major factor in my negative mindset, but just being vaguely self-aware doesn't magically warp my eternal bad attitude out of existence, though I sure wish it did. I feel trapped in my own brain. I feel unlovable, like maybe being completely and doubtlessly valued is just genuinely something that's meant for some lucky people and not me. Like this is just how I'm fated to be as a person, and whatever greater purpose I want to think is out there doesn't even exist. I feel hopeless. I feel selfish for wanting more. I know my struggles with food are valid, but even assigning it the title of ""eating disorder"" feels like I'm taking something away from people with real problems. I feel lazy and childish and overdramatic for having so much difficulty with something that could be solved by simply eating something, anything, but if it doesn't sound at least semi-decent I can't force myself to do anything about it. At least addressing my food avoidance is somewhere to start, even if writing out this whole post so far has felt grossly theatrical, albeit extremely accurate to how I'm feeling. Addressing and my true feelings and revealing them to others is one of the most difficult tasks for me. I hate feeling vulnerable, or like my issues are a burden on others. I guess it feels good to identify my own emotions in a decently-worded manner. Writing this out was very difficult for me, so thank you for taking the time to read through my huge blocks of text, I do genuinely appreciate it. 

I'm looking for any advice this community can provide in regards to my post (neurodivergent-friendly food suggestions, similar experiences you've had to my own and how you've dealt with it, or anything else you think would helpful for me to read). Worth noting in case you have suggestions, I don't have any food allergies. I don't care for most sweet/dessert-y foods, but I find that I usually prefer salty and/or meat-centric meals. I don't dislike cooking generally, but the more time/effort something requires of me the more it significantly diminishes my general food-making motivation.

I’m 17. My whole life I’ve been underweight. I would skip breakfast and lunch because I had no time to prepare food and I’d only eat supper and wake up at 1am and eat my whole fridge. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression and for that I had to eat 3 meals a day and establish a routine. I also got on depo provera that time. I quickly gained and am now overweight.. I stopped gaining weight once I stopped depo provera and now whenever I eat I feel nauseous?? Like yesterday it took me an hour to eat a bagel. Even when I’m hungry I have a hard time eating or I feel like my body is blocking me from taking in any food.. Like I’m repulsed by it. I have no idea what’s going on but I weigh myself every. single. day. And every time I feel nervous but I still step on the scale. I lost weight since last year but I’m still anxious about gaining. Just last year I’d eat so much and all I could think about was food. I was in a bad relationship and the only thing I ever did was sleep and eat and if I ate something that didn’t satisfy me I’d get upset.. Every time I mention these things to my mom she mocks me and says it’s all in my head. I’m really questioning wether or not it’s real. I have no idea what to think anymore.

Hello, First of all sorry for my bad english, and sorry if this isnt the right place to post this but ive been looking everywhere and can't find any answer. I will get my COVID vaccine soon and i'm looking forward to it. The thing is my bmi is in the severely underweight category and I'm really scared that my body won't be able to take the vaccine well. My mom is a healthy weight and felt really bad after getting her second injection so i'm kind of terrified. I'm not very good at handling being nauseous/not having appetite/having diarrhea, which some people reported having after their second dose, as i'm trying rlly hard to recover and those things are very triggering to me. But most of all even though i didn't see any counter-indications on the internet for being vaccinated while underweight i'm scared sh\*tless of dying from the vaccine I tried looking up everywhere on the internet, even asked on forums and called national helplines. Everyone keeps telling me to ask my doctor but i can't see them rn (bcs of reasons). My mom took an appointment for my vaccine in june but i'm really nervous.

529,EatingDisorders,"I started recovery from what we think is atypical anorexia recently, and it feels like it’s moving way too fast. I went from talking to a therapist once every week or two to being expected to talk to 2 separate people weekly and attend long outpatient sessions 4x a week (this hasn’t started yet). They’re asking me to make a lot of sudden, drastic changes to my diet that make me wildly uncomfortable and anxious. I’m still torn between just cooperating/ trusting professionals and continuing to find loopholes so I can keep control. I know there’s no future for me that I’d want if I continue down that path, but I put so much time, effort, and pain into losing the weight, and I’m having a hard time accepting that it was all hurting me/was a waste, since I feel like I’ve accomplished so much and look way better now. I feel so much more valid at a lower weight, and I refuse to accept the possibility of gaining any of it back, if that’s what recovery will mean for me (it’s especially difficult because I’m at a healthy weight currently, so on paper, weight gain isn’t absolutely necessary.) I’m so confused and scared of what this process will look like for me. If I start to notice weight gain in my current mental state, I genuinely think I will be a danger to myself.

I’m 21 F, and I’m not sure if this is the place to post. I don’t count calories excessively, I don’t vomit, but a year ago I was a healthy weight with the goal of wanting to lose some. And I’ve had a really stressful time at uni this year and it’s made me just stop eating. I knew I have lost lots of weight (I think it still be in the healthy weight category just about) and I feel great in my body, but my house mate commented the other day on how I don’t seem to eat anything and I decided to add up everything I’ve eaten in the past few days and it’s barely anything. Not sure if I am allowed to put numbers of calories in here.

I am hungry a lot of the time but I honestly just don’t notice it. It’s something I’ve recognised before but I decided it made me feel better because I don’t have any bloating from food and I feel like I’m accomplishing something. I’ve just started seeing someone and I don’t want to be conscious of my belly around her when she sees me, and I just feel better in myself in general so I just forget about being hungry. I had some fitness goals but I haven’t exercised in a long time because I’ve been so busy with uni work. So I don’t feel weak or tired from the not eating, but I don’t feel strong anymore (I had some muscle from when I did Muay Thai for 5 years but now I feel physically weak muscle wise) and I want to change that.

Basically, I read this story about someone who was in a calorie deficit for a long time and when they tried to gain muscle they found they had to gain weight because they had “ruined” their metabolism, and it made me so scared because I’d never thought about it before but clearly I’ve been in a massive calorie deficit for so long I feel like if I start eating “normal” I’m going to gain weight and I really don’t want to. I feel good about my body for the first time but I also feel so unhealthy. Am I encouraging an unhealthy relationship with food in myself? How do I fix it without gaining back all the weight I’ve lost?

I follow lots of fitspo accounts in the hopes I’ll be motivated to be fit and they all say that you should eat well, but ALSO you have to be in a calorie deficit to lose weight. But I feel like I’ve taken that to the extreme, especially since I don’t have any time to work out (exam season).

she asked me what size i wanted and i said “large”. she looked at me and said “seriously? Do you really need all of that?”.
this crushed me, when i got home i ended up pouring the drink down the sink.

534,EatingDisorders,"I’m 3 years recovered from my ED, and while I have a relatively okay relationship with food now, I still find food description words extremely uncomfortable to say or hear. I feel physically sick when I hear people use words like ‘delicious’ or ‘tasty’. Even typing them makes me feel uncomfortable, and I haven’t said them verbally in probably 10 years. On top of that, I also have an extreme fear of saying the names of certain foods, as well as hearing other people use them. This hasn’t been a huge problem in the past, but now that I’ve voiced to my friends and family what my trigger words are in an attempt to make them understand that they still have to be mindful even though I’m recovered, they feel the need to say them over and over ‘as a joke’ because i end up getting sick and having to excuse myself. I guess it’s just funny to them. I am fully aware that my triggers aren’t anyone else’s problem, but there’s a difference between them being able to speak freely about food around me, and saying trigger words over and over to make me uncomfortable. However, with that being said, I’d much rather get over the triggers than have to argue with my friends and family over respecting the fact that doing this is uncomfortable for me. Uncomfortable is also an understatement but I don’t know what other word use to describe the feeling. 

So, is this a problem that anyone else has ? And if it is, how do you get over/cope with it ?

I’ve been trying to induce vomiting for the past 2 hours and I’m losing my shit and I don’t know what to fucking do. 

I broke down crying when I realized that and I just don’t know what to do I told myself that it’d be fine because I did it once or twice months ago that it wouldn’t be an issue

I saw a my reflection which made me do this. I felt I ate too much this morning

I DONT EVEN KNOW MY FUCKING WEIGHT that’s the asinine nature of it all too

Because I’m in a motor chair and can’t stand I need a special device to be weighed and good luck finding one in state with this shit infrastructure and healthcare (USA)

I can’t tell my partner bc she makes dumb fucking comments about me being hot in response to this. Or that I simply shouldn’t entrain those thoughts

I need to not tell her or my only friend because I just need to have my shit together and I simply don’t

My other friend has an ED and I don’t want to bother him because I wasn’t the best support for him. I know that now all too late. I realized today that a year ago how he brought it up once and I made a “ you need to aim for a healthy weight “ comment. I know I meant well I just.....I wish I could apologize He’s never brought it up since

For context. He said he was happy he reached —lbs (which was very underweight . )He said he knew he shouldn’t have been but wanted to share

He’s not proana. I just wish I said something better. That wouldn’t trigger or enable but show support

I can check the search to see how best to apologize to him

I wonder If bringing up the situation to apologize for would end up triggering him...

Reading one advice post regarding the holidays bothered me “Focus on your heart not hips” and my friend probably felt just as patronized when I said to focus on healthy stuff

Reading that line just made me want to self harm my hips lol

I don’t know if I have an ED or not I really don’t want one

I don’t know if I’m pretending it’s okay or if I’m just on some dicey line and there’s time to get out

I know though. I know I have something wrong and I don’t know how to fix it. 5 years ago I self harmed over drinking too much soda and 2 years ago I went a week eating nothing but sunflower seeds and freaking out over their calorie count

I did ask my friend a year ago because I noticed I had issue with eating . And he recommended to force eat something you really really like. And I tried that a number of times with no luck

Because of the anxiety I have around eating I just try to avoid thinking about or I lose appetite. I’ve tried exercising and did it to the point of using it as a method of self harm

I’ve tried dieting and did it to the point of eating nothing but seeds until I passed out

I can’t even ignore it because now I’m going to have to avoid every thought about my body or I’m going to lose my shit because I’m that fucking incompetent

I hardly eat. And when I do it’s sugar and carbs and I’m stressed it’s sugar and carbs and I’m always fucking stressed

I’m 22 btw. I asked my PCP for referrals to dietitian a month ago and was told the dietitian would call me back. Twice....no call

Possibly relevant background: I was obese when I was little and was bullied for it. I lost a lot of weight in high school and went from obese to being a bit thin (I don’t think this was unhealthy though, because judging by my frame I’m pretty sure I’m naturally thin), through restricting calories intake. 

I am happy with my body, I think, but I do still fear gaining weight again. I do feel like I sometimes see myself ugly as soon as I notice I’ve gained weight on the scale, and better looking as soon as I see I’ve lost weight.

We are both 14 and she's been trying not to eat since she was 11. some random guy called her fat and she says that this started all. since 2021 started her mom has been making comments on her when she eats like ""you are eating too much"", ""you are gaining weight"", etc. when she's around with other people she has to eat so she does it but when shes alone sometimes tries to avoid it. she drinks water and smoke to calm hunger and a few times tried to vomit but she couldn't. she told her mom that her comments were hurting her and that she has been struggling to eat but her mom just got mad. she also self harms and wanted to kill herself a few times but luckily she never tried it. her parents don't believe in therapy. after a lot of months of pushing they finally sent her with a therapist but after a month they stopped because ""it won't fix anything"" and ""it's a waste of money and time"". we've been together for a few months and I've been trying to be the most supportive I can for her. yesterday she told me about her eating problems.

553,EatingDisorders,"Hi.
I (53F) have struggled with various eating disorders from the time I was about eight years old. It's mostly been BED, with periods of severe restriction especially in my 20s and 30s. I finally sought help at the end of 2019 and spent four months in an intensive outpatient program at a highly-regarded eating disorders clinic. It helped tremendously, especially with ""fat acceptance"". Some of the best lessons I learned were that food is just fuel, there are no ""bad"" foods, and ""fat"" is just an adjective. When I left the program, I had tools under my belt and a new outlook.
And then the pandemic hit. Along with the isolation and the toxic positivity that is thrown at essential workers (I am one) and some severe mental health struggles my kid was having that were leading to rages and abuse, the binges came back -- not quite full-bore, but close.
I have been excusing my binges by comparing them to worse binges I've had in the past. I keep hanging on to ""fat acceptance"" and the fact that I am the fat girl who baffles doctors with her perfect blood pressure and perfect cholesterol and perfect A1C. Thing is, it's gotten to the point where my weight is affecting my health now. I am at the highest weight I have ever been in my life. My feet and lower back hurt all. the. time. My stomach is starting to get in the way of sex. I took my dog out for a walk yesterday and it took 20 minutes to walk less than half a mile. Five years ago, I was walking 20-30 miles a week.
I spent so many years hating my body. Treatment got me to love my body again. Now I am having a hard time reconciling the fact that I need to take action to be kind to my body against the old tapes that are telling me that any sort of modification, tracking, or restriction of food intake means that I hate my body.

554,EatingDisorders," 

My younger sister is in the midst of a particularly low point with her anorexia. It's rather intense. I have never had an ED, or been close... on the contrary, food is my best friend, always has been... my family and I are doing everything we can to wrap our heads around it (any advice here would be great as well). She has been opening up to me about her thoughts during my visit home to see her, expressing to me that her ""ED thoughts"" are particularly strong right now - specifically that food will harm her, make her fat, make her stomach hurt, and that getting through this is so much arduous work and she is not convinced that she even deserves that kind of attention and care from herself. It is body image, self-worth, and seemingly most prominently, the stomach pain (tips on navigating this are beyond welcome too). She has been in and out of treatment centers, but she has moved around from place to place, even signing herself out at the last one, never completing a program for a multitude of reasons: the food tastes bad (food always tastes bad to her, but extra bad in the facilities) and you don't get to pick what you eat, her therapists are not present enough to actually talk about things and do actual work (they just force her to eat and sleep, that's it), she doesn't get to go outside, etc. Honestly, sounds awful to me too. I mean, isn't a large part of ED the issue of mentally linking food, or lack thereof, with punishment? Does this approach of taking away privileges and human rights to breathing fresh air not simply reinforce this way of perceiving food? Genuinely, I want to understand if this works for people - if she is simply resisting inpatient because her ED is in the drivers seat, or if these concerns are valid and shared by many who have gone to inpatient, or perhaps a bit of both.

Now she is in this tough spot. She is at my parents place where my parents are the ones figuratively wrestling with her to complete her meals, which seem to be one of three things: a shake of ensure mixed with peanut butter and ice cream, 5 or 6 yogurt covered pretzels, or a slice of bread. She freezes and I can see her panic on her face when she is served food. As you may have deduced, she is slowly losing weight after the weight she sustained from 6 or so months on a feeding tube. She is at the point where if she went to an outpatient/partial program, they would likely strongly suggest inpatient or drop her from the program for liability reasons. Same with therapists... she is meeting with one tomorrow who may be more open to the possibility of taking her on than others.

Like physically i’ve recovered i never dropped to a dangerous weight even though i lost a lot of weight. i didn’t gain the weight back but i don’t think i will unless my eating gets completely out of control again. and that’s the thing my eating doesn’t feel out of control it is relatively normal but it still feels like i have an ed. previously i would starve myself so i could feel hungry i wouldn’t eat unless it was a certain time all while i was exercising a ton. now i’m not doing those things anymore i’m eating what i want to and i don’t track calories anymore because what i want to eat isn’t always unhealthy but i still feel like i have an ed like my mindset is still there. idk if this makes sense but like i still think about restricting and how i don’t exercise as much and how im probably eating more than i was when i was exercising a ton and how much i miss being hungry. im worried that feeling like this will cause a relapse or a binge and i didn’t think i wanted that to happen cause i wanted to recover but the thoughts make me think i kinda do and it scares me.

556,eating_disorders,"hey, i just wanted to say that this is in no way meant to be a harmful post, i just really want to reach out and ask you if anyone else feels that way:

i was overweight as a child, i ate my feelings because my parents weren‘t there for me for some time (i was 10 i think, my mum had a miscarriage). my mum was depressed, which is understandable, but i was not really feeling the same. i always loved my mum and needed time with her, but when she was not always there for me, i would just cry and / or eat.

i gained a lot if weight really quickly and my body couldn‘t take it, so i got a bunch of stretch marks, which im still rly insecure about.

when i was about to turn 13, i was really depressed (i have had these phases of rly bad depressed feelings since i was 10), so i decided to loose a lot of weight. i started to count my calories and wouldn’t eat more than like more than 400 a day. i lost over 50 lbs in 3-4 months and was pretty skinny. 
ppl were worried because i looked sick, i just lost too much way too fast. my hair fell out, i was pale and didn‘t have energy at all. 
it got so bad that on my 13th birthday i cried because of the cake, i thought it had way too many calories and i would gain the weight that i had lost at that point back.

so this was some time ago, im about to turn 15 now. my disordered eating got better after a few months, before i was 14, i was already kind of okay again. i didn‘t gain weight back after loosing it in such an unhealthy way, but this year i had to change schools because i am now in highschool. i hated the school a lot at first, and i got back into the habit of eating my feelings. i gained 18 lbs since school started this year and in november i decided to loose weight and be skinny again.

in december i started to starve myself again because i wanted to be skinny again as fast as possible. i don‘t have patience at all, so if i want to loose weight, it has to be as fast as possible. i lost 12 lbs again until now and i want to loose a bit more still. i am pretty good at not eating during the day, which of course helps me loose weight, but not in a healthy way at all. i have lots of willpower when it comes to starving, and i don‘t think i look way to fat anymore. 

but i have had this „problem“ lately:
i feel like fat ppl anger me.
i can‘t understand this feeling at all but i am feeling this way since december. 
they make me feel bad for them, knowing they can‘t really feel good about their body.
when i was fat i would cry a lot about it and my self esteem was non-existent. 
now when i see fat ppl, i get physically angry and i have to calm down. 
they make me feel fat too. i hated the mentality i had when i was fat and i feel like these fat people remind me of myself and how much i hated my body.
i have a rly overweight girl in my class and sometimes when i see her in the morning, i want to just simply punch her in the face because i get so frustrated and annoyed at all the fat on her body and face.
this is such a weird thing to feel and i can‘t control it. 

i am also a person who cries a lot to let out their anger. so sometimes at school i just have to go to the bathroom and lock myself in there because i feel like i might start crying infront of everyone and need to just calm down.
i hate looking at fat people, but i can‘t understand why. i was fat myself for a few years, so i feel like its something else than a person who has always been thin saying this.
i understand how you feel about being fat yourself, abd i was bodyshamed and knew what orher people were thinking about the way i looked.

but now, i have this hatred for rly fat people too. i hate myself for feeling this way, but i feel so helpless about it. i don‘t know if i hate looking at them because i know how much i hated being overweight, because i‘m afraid i will gain the weight back (literally my biggest fear), or beacuse i just turned into a bad person and i can‘t stop projecting my insecurities onto them.
i am not overweight right now, so why do i starve myself right now to loose weight, but they won‘t?? they are the ones who shouldn‘t eat, thats what i think, i get so angry about my brain hating my body so much that i just wont eat. but they always do and they have these flaps of fat on their ugly bodies and faces.

i know i shouldn‘t feel this way, but why do i then? 
btw my parents aren‘t thin either, but i don‘t feel this hatred for them, just for people i don‘t know personally, i really love my mum and dad:)
overweight teenagers are the fat people i hate the most, especially fat girls. 
i feel like i have to throw up sometimes when i see them.
i feel so bad saying this, because i was once fat myself, love some overweight people dearly, and am really afraid i might gain weight back again.
does anyone else have this feeling in them? it just gets worse when i am starving myself and see a fat person, i just have so much anger in me being constantly hungry, i am frustrated and i even scream at my friends sometimes over the smallest things they said.

.

I have been suffering from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now with on and off recovery which never lasts long.

In 2020 when covid hit i gained a bit of weight and became depressed then developed and ED, I have told my bsf about it and tbh she was not very understanding of it, she is one of those people who think its my chice and i could just eat. I obv can't change someone's thoughts and believes so i never really bothered. later that year i decided to start recovery and i mentioned it to her, while all my family were supportive of this decision, one time i was showing her my breakfast ( we used to send each other daily vlogs and stuff) and mentioning how I'm starting to be healthier and bla bla bla, she them replied back with ""OH MY GOD! You eat sooo much food wow, that's probably as much as my brother, wow."" This was the most triggering thing someone ever commented on my food. the thing is my ""big"" breakfast was too hard boiled eggs, 2 low carb crackers and a bunch of veggies...

i felt sooooo guilty and i believed that it is too much and always been afraid to eat like that in fear of being perceived like so. Anyways, needless to say that it made me relapse immediately and honestly thinking of recovering is never serious as it was back then.

The thing here is , she knows I've relapsed and i never really talked about my ed with her ever since. However, she still to this day says the most triggering things ever. Like ''Oh, i haven't eaten since yesterday."" ""I haven't eaten for 24hrs"" ""I only had tea for breakfast"" and so more of these, the thing is she does not have an ed... she just likes to brag like some of those people, and she knows that i have an ed and she still brags to me.

she sometimes checks on me if i ate or not and all that but it doesn't really differ when i know that she believes I'm pathetic and ""its all my choice""

Tw: just a sad vent, not positive 

We have food but it’s only ingredients. I hate cooking because I wasn’t really taught how to cook. I’m embarrassed and I refuse to ask how from my mother as she will just have more of an ego boost from it. She just buys fast food or we eat out then she gets angry on how much money we’re spending to eat out. Why should I (the child) have to be cooking for us? She has pointed out my weight gain. I went from thin to overweight and she doesn’t understand that I used to be so skinny because my relationship with food is bad and I debate doing it again because it will make me skinny because it worked last time. I tried cutting sodas but it tastes so good and she gave me these quotes to put on my wall that say &gt;!don’t wish for it, work for it!&lt; And &gt;!once you see results, it becomes an addiction!&lt; And she basically enables me. She gets angry that I’m so picky. I debate just counting calories and “fasting” at this point to lose weight and cut sodas out. She won’t cook and when she does she won’t clean the dishes and will just leave them there. I’m a parentified child. I listen to her vents and I I give her advice and I listen to her problems all the time. I’ve made her meals before and when she gets sick I’ll bring her medicine and make sure she gets rest. I make sure the house is cleaned but it’s so hard to stay on top of it when I have destructive dogs and a mother to clean up after. Then I have my own room and school work to stay on top of or else she will be angry my grades are so bad. I have to take all the “blows” when she’s angry or sad or mad at someone else or grumpy.

I have had anorexia for 15 years. My last big relapse was in 2019 but since then my weight has been stable and I have a more or less healthy relationship with food (A few rules still but manageable)

In the last few weeks the voice of Anorexia has come to me at totally random times. When I'm walking to walk or lying in bed I will hear that inner voice telling me that I need to lose weight, I'm fat and reminding me of all the ""great"" things being sick can bring. Ie ; control. 

I've also been having dreams of binging and noticed that I've gotten into the habit of weighing myself more often. I don't have scales at my house but I go into a local store that has a BMI machine.

Last Autumn was very stressful and traumatic so I'm thinking that I'm having some kind of delayed reaction to it. I do feel really out of control with some important things in my life and I'm scared this is heading to another relapse.

I asked her if there is anything I should do / avoid to keep from triggering her. She said no.  She hasn't said anything up until about two weeks ago when she was really feeling terrible about her body image, that she thought that  my preferences were at triggering her. The only times we've really talked about my preferences are when she asked me what I liked in a woman: Smart, petite, beautiful, funny.  I might have possible mixed up the word petite and skinny as I said it in a non native tongue. I have also on several occasions told her that she's the perfect size. She recently asked me if I liked the hip/stomach gap and I said yes - it was a few days after this she told me that it was risky being with me because of my preferences. She's never corrected me or told me that something was triggering her or making her feel bad. I was so shocked!  


I love my girlfriend like no one I've ever met, she is amazing. I'd date her no matter what she looked like, and have told her as much. But she is exactly what I look for in a girl. It feels like she's mad at me for being attracted to her. Sure I do like petite girls, but she is and has always been pretty much this size.  Other than the comments above we never had a discussion about what I like, we never talked about what my exes  look like, what actresses I like, that there is limit, that someone can be too skinny - shes just come to some conclusion about what I like without really involving me. We've never talked about that I have plenty of things I'm physically attracted to about her.  That the ""underwear gap"", thing is like 1 of 20 things that I find sexy in women.

571,eating_disorders,"I repeat: TW for numbers, cals, weight, anything on the book. I am STRUGGLING.

IDK if this is the right place but here it goes. okay so basically to get straight to it, i’m pretty sure I’ve developed an eating disorder and I’m not quite sure what to do about it. I think i’ve always struggled with disordered eating habits (mostly from my teen years), but since i’ve never really been uw and have mostly been overweight for most of my life no one’s really bat an eye about my weight habits. my yearly cycles mostly consisted of restricting a couple of months and then binging the next couple, if that makes sense. 

That was basically my life up until two or three years ago, when my mom kicked me out of my house and my eating habits went all over the place. i had just graduated high school and had also started smoking weed like 24/7 (and at the time i didn’t think it was anything cus yk i was ignorant and caught up in my emotional problems) which i honestly believe triggered some kind of BED in me. Like, at first, it was just having the “munchies”, but soon after i spiraled out of control and even if i wasn’t high, i’d eat so uncomfortably much that i’d just feel sick by the end of it. I would hide food so no one would eat it in random spots, I’d make sure no one saw any trash that could be related to my binging sessions and it was honestly a whole mess. I decided to blame it all on COVID and being stuck home all day and my depression which was out of control as well. But never an ED.

So, when my mom kicked me out, i moved out across the country basically to live with my grandparents, and DID try to get on a healthy diet, but it just wasn’t working for me and i fell back into my restricting/binging cycle from years before again. It was like this for 1 year. I put on an extreme amount of weight (i’ve never in my life gotten to that point and it was making me desperate) and something inside me just kind of clicked and that’s when i think i’ve been engaging in full ED behavior. 

For this past year, i’ve been punishing myself basically by restricting as much as possible. I’d only break this habit whenever i’d get drunk, which was another problem for me because i think i was giving myself a drinking problem, because when i drink, i DRINK, ok. It was bad. But i’d start to use my drunkenness as a mean to binge, but then purge soon after with the excuse that my stomach just became upset from drinking. Even I believed it in the beginning. All of this, however, was occasional, so I never cared either and it wasnt affecting my weight at all, tbh. I was still gaining weight.

Then comes my 20th birthday. I became so sick of myself, of this person i was now. Of my body. Of how people treat me because of my weight. I couldn’t go a single day without someone reminding me of my weight and of how i looked (mostly family members). I am fed up. I started comparing myself (CONSTANTLY) to my friends, my sister, cousins, and everyone who i deemed prettier than me because they were all beautiful and skinny and set my mind on losing weight for this upcoming year. I’m not going to continue being so insecure about my weight. I'm going to change this about myself. i want to be someone who people will show off and feel proud about. 

So, around december, i went full crazy on this thing. I started purging every meal i ate, i’ve become obsessed with my calorie intake, and i just cant stop weight checking myself or body checking anymore. I told myself that after a week or so, i’d stop, but i’ve become so happy with the outcome of this that i can’t seem to actually stop. Everyone praises me for my weight loss. I’ve managed to lose a big amount of weight already in a month. And everyone is so proud of me for this, so it really doesn’t help me at all to try to stop. Christmas was horrible and new Years eve as well. I only broke my diet on Christmas, but i’d never purged so much in a single day, and i just felt so sick of myself. 

It’s gotten so far up my ass that i can’t think about anything other than losing weight. When i went full-time, it started out with at least eating twice a day, so long as i didn’t go over my calorie limit, yk. But after like 2 weeks, i started enjoying the hunger. There’s days where i’ll eat maybe a rice cake, or only a supplement protein shake and call it a day. Eating disgusts me. All i can think about when i see food is how quickly I’m going to have to purge it when i’m done eating it. I cant eat with people around, because i feel like they can see me gag down my food, because the disgust and nausea becomes overwhelming now most times. If i feel full off a meal, it’s game over; there’s no way i won’t throw it up. I’m always feeling lightheaded and dizzy, even though i make sure to drink lots of water throughout the day. Being hungry is not really a discomfort anymore, it’s become comforting. I’m starting to become obsessed with how many calories i burn in a day (i have an apple watch that is helping feed into this 😹) or how many steps i take, but i am rather lazy so i’m not sure if i’ll put up with it for too long. I’ve been obsessing over that stupid BMI chart too, and i can’t stop checking when i will reach my healthy weight (currently 162 lbs but i’m barely 5’0 so you know 😭) on the chart and it’s driving me up a wall. I went to a doctor the other day because i’ve been getting sick with weird shit that i’ve never caught before (I blame it on my immune system being ass bc well YA KNO but ive started taking vitamins) and saw that i was considered obese (I know this sounds rough, but being considered that for me is like horrible, I've always been bullied for my weight so please bare with me) and almost had a stroke in the waiting room. And this was when I was already losing crazy weight because i was like 169 lbs for that, and i started my weight loss at almost 190 😭. It was a nightmare knowing where i stand on the BMI chart. 

there’s probably so much more i could add to this, but i don’t want to make this too long LOL. I do wanna apologize i don’t want to offend anyone because i know that the way i speak about myself can be harsh or triggering to others, but this is genuinely how i feel and i need to rip this bandaid off ASAP because i feel out of control and don’t know where to go. I know i’m kinda fat phobic, but this is genuinely just to myself because i honestly don’t give two shits about how other people look. i only care about how i look and want to look, if that makes sense, so again sorry if it comes off wrong, i don’t mean it for others, just towards myself. 

i’ve been doing my share of research on the topic, but i honestly don’t know what to do with any of the information except just sit there, like, ok i think i have an ED, so what now? yk what i mean 😹 I don't really know why I'm writing this. I guess I'm just looking for comfort in knowing that there's others like me that have been thru this or going thru it.

574,eating_disorders,"Please mod or let me know if my post violates rules. 

**Sorry rant.**

Note: my ED is due to limited diet due to medical problems. Inability to eat and GI issues. 

I use to be very obese due to a few medical issues. Got them treated. Even prior to that I was slowly working on losing weight. 

When I got near my goal which was the top portion of normal for my BMI I dropped that weight very fast in about 4 months. Not intentionally. I was working out a lot. Strength training with marathon length walks and severely limiting my calories (1200- short person). For my height it wasn't that low but my doctor did get concerned. 

At my lowest/goal I was considered normal for my BMI but I had a very low body fat percentage I'm assuming because I was very boney. Cheeks, collar bones, hips, ribs above and below all stuck out. Strangers started calling me mean names. This was the top portion of normal BMI for my height but I did look severe. My periods were scarce. Blood work was good. 

I have health problems that make it hard to eat, digest, taste, and smell. I don't like a lot of foods and have a very restricted diet. I was eating and very healthy. 

I wasn't necessarily interventioned but my family would cry, beg me to eat, and show me pictures of people with anorexia. My partner at the time would say things like ""I use to anorexic"" and also show me pics. Random people and family would try to feed me. I was eating but it was difficult, unpleasant, and sometimes painful. 

I gained a good 10lbs back. That I needed. I had previously gotten injured trying to lift a 40lb bag. I took on a job that required me to routinely lift half my weight and I need to put on some mass. 

I gained a good healthy 20-30lbs of mostly muscle. I then frequently received negative comments about how I'm ""gaining weight"" ""filling out"" ""need to lay off the snacks"" amongst other rude comments. However- when I was at my ""normal"" I was so weak I wouldn't have been able to perform my job. I was reasonably fit and extremely muscular. My doctor was perfectly okay with where I was at so long as labs are good and I feel good. 

Turns out- my medical condition was flaring up and I needed a medication adjustment- it's been a year we are still working on it. I'm now over weight again. But also lost most of my strength due to my condition. 

One of my not so well meaning family members is into the whole ""keto"" thing. I cannot do keto. My doctor said NO. My medication bottle says no I will get sick. I've explained that with my condition I need a specific diet for my medicine to work properly. 

High protein, high calorie, high simple carbs, low fat, low fiber. 

Despite me explaining this and sharing resources, and me kindly saying I'm glad that works for you please don't comment on my diet. 

It did not cease and it then became- bro you also have an ED you should talk to your doc about it, if you want to improve your appearance go workout, stop picking at my diet, you're underweight for your height and leave me the F- alone. They don't make these comments to other family members. They were not present when I was bone thin. 

I know the way I called them out wasn't appropriate but I'm not tolerating it. Comments like ""you need to lay off the sugar"" ""that's bad for you"" ""glad you're finally quitting the sugar"" ""try this product (that's definitely not safe for me)""

 I occasionally get low blood sugar and have had severe falls. No- I'm going to stay alive thanks! With my GI issues it became so hard to eat if it wasn't ultra processed or pure sugar everything hurt and I'd spend hours laying down in pain. It's getting better. 

I am working on getting down to a healthy weight- in a healthy manner this time. I've been very ill for about 4 months. I cannot afford to lose my strength or muscle mass. 

But it's extremely irritating. The negative comments no matter what weight I'm at. When people pick at what I eat and how I got treated when I was at a healthy weight but also a ""normal"" weight. 

I can't eat or cook around people and I'm very defensive about my food. I don't enjoy eating out or any function involving food especially with my restrictions.

I have ARFID. I have trouble eating and I often forget to eat at all. I usually only eat dinner cuz it’s routine and everyone else eats dinner so I do too. I’ve only been diagnosed for a few months, but I’ve had the disorder for years, at least since 6th grade, and I’m in 11th. I used to throw up food after I ate it, but not because I wanted to. I would choke and it would come back up.

I don’t remember to eat 90% of the time, when I’m reminded a majority of the time I *don’t* want to. Sometimes the thought of trying to eat makes me gag. The idea of choking down food and forcing it down my throat terrifies me. I’m seeing an Occupational Therapist, and she asked me why I wanted to change.  


The answer is, I don’t. My friends and family are getting really concerned with how thin I’m getting. I’m rapidly losing weight. I went in for a doctor’s appointment on October 12th, and I weighed 125 pounds. We went back in on November 15th and I weighed 119 pounds. That’s 6 pounds in just as many weeks. I don’t even want to know how much I weigh now. I’ll look through my camera roll and see images of myself from a month or so ago and do a double take.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t want to change though, I don’t care. I like myself the way I am and it’s not hurting me. My friends keep telling me I’m going to end up in the hospital, my mom is getting increasingly worried and I just don’t care anymore. I’d honestly happily just stop eating all together except for a few meals here and there (I love food, I still wanna eat, just… sparingly.)

I restrict on and off and purge pretty regularly, but the thoughts and stuff are always there. I'm not sure what I have but i know deep down its not normal. I can't talk about it with anyone because i feel so embarrassed by it. Being in relationships in general has been a really big trigger for me for years, especially if we get intimate regularly.

Do i tell my boyfriend about it? i feel this pressure that if i dont ill be lying to him in some way. hes a kind person and we really like eachother. we've told eachother personal things like family traumas before. but im scared of him thinking i have too much 'baggage' and break things off, or he won't know how to react and unknowingly hurt me more in trying to help. or he feels like having to tip toe around that type of stuff with me. and it'll put too much pressure on the relationship

hes offhandedly mentioned things like he used to be 'fat' a long time ago, mentioned certain parts of his body hes insecure about, etc. just very tiny comments in long convos. for context. the good thing is, he does have a healthy relationship with food from what ive seen and loves all different types. its rubbed off on me and i've gotten more comfortable eating in front of him and in public. so sometimes it feels like im faking having an ED and therefore 'not worth talking about'. But also most of the time, I restrict and purge especially on days before I know we are going to get intimate. Should he know about it?

When I first sat down at the table and put my plate she said ""that's a-lot of food, are you going to eat all that, I thought you don't eat"" (I had a few bits of turkey, 4 roast potato's, carrots, yorkshire pudding and some gravy.)

Whilst I was eating she kept looking at my plate, then when I finished she said ""you've eaten all that"". I kept pushing her comments away and just carried on eating, when I finished I still felt hungry so I went up to get a few more bits (like everyone else did) and she then said ""are you getting more"" just to me. Everyone else had finishing eating apart from me and the last thing she said was ""are you still eating"".

All them comments made me feel guilty and that I ate too much even though everybody else portions were bigger than mine. I guess the elderly don't understand/think that those types of comments can really affect someone that struggles with food.

So I've been skinny my whole life and I used to hate being called thin or ""skin and bones"" but as I got older i realized that most of my identity to others comes from being thin. But i still hate being called skinny. Not because I don't want to be skinny, but because I don't feel like I'm being praised for something I've earned. I'm petite because that's my body type, not because I exercise or use self-discipline. And don't get me wrong, I wish my thighs were narrower and my stomach is definitely flat, and people DO perceive me as underweight, even though I'm not quite there yet. But when people call me skinny I can only think ""They do not realize this isn't even close. I am skinny to them (because I was born this way). I'm not skinny to me because I haven't lost unnecessary weight"" Idek if I'll look that different when i reach my GW and I don't know if I'll even accept the comments then.

hey so i’m 19 F and i struggle with anorexia and an exercise addiction pretty badly. i also have a pretty strict routine that i’ve been following for such a long time that i find so much comfort in (eating times, meals, workout routine etc..) and whenever something in my day suddenly changes and my routine is changed i get really bad anxiety and start to panic. One of the things i struggle the most with is when i do decide to eat (not mentioning how long i go without food) i eat my safe foods which are a small small handful of options. it’s usually my favorite burger place or sushi because i wanna eat something that’s “worth it” and something i know i’m gonna enjoy. Now whenever my family see me eating those two meals they always judge me for how much i have them, and they always give me comments about them and it made me feel so ashamed of myself like i’m not even deserving of those 2 meals that i’ve been allowing myself SOMETIMES. i’ve been thinking of just not eating them at all and just withering away lol. and i cannot for the life of me have something else other than those safe foods :( it just brings me way too much anxiety and i know i won’t enjoy them as much as my favorite foods. i don’t know what to do because i feel so ashamed whenever i have my favorite safe foods now and so undeserving even if i rarely allow myself them anymore. what do i do? :( does anyone relate or am i alone",,dealing with the shame,1,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,zs43hv,1,OkAlbatross5642,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/zs43hv/dealing_with_the_shame/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/zs43hv/dealing_with_the_shame/,1671662956,278,0,0,0,-1,1,Family making judgmental comments about the user's safe foods,harmful,"Feeling ashamed and undeserving of the user's favorite foods, Causing anxiety and panic when the user's routine is changed",Family making negative comments about the writer's safe foods,harmful,"Feeling ashamed and undeserving of their favorite foods, Increased anxiety and panic when their routine is disrupted",Family members making negative comments about the writer's safe foods,harmful,"Feeling ashamed and undeserving when eating their favorite safe foods, Considering not eating those safe foods at all, Struggling with anxiety when eating foods outside of their safe foods"

603,eating_disorders,"Hello.  
I can't make an appointment at my docs to speak to them about my binge eating dissorder, it's been getting worse and worse but for half a year I can't book an appointment with a GP. Could really go with some advice if anyone has any.   


I was raised on junkfood and have always been a binge eater; stress is a trigger, but I will binge eat to some degree without any trigger. I can have food cravings that will be on the front of my mind the entire day, and distractions do not help.  
I can't seem to stop myself binge eating and I will very easily eat double my reccomended calory intake every single day and I am unable to stop myself. It's easy for me to access it becuase I have a shop next to my house and my family member will buy me junk food even though I ask them not to....  


It's gotten really bad the last few years. I have a medical condition that makes me gain weight a bit faster than most people and that is really making this harder. I have an active job; on my feet 8+ hours a day, but I can eat 800 calories and still gain weight.   


My binges are usually me just continuouly inhaling all types of unhealthy foods for hours and in large quanitities.   
I have REALLY been needing to get some help becuase recently I have been making myself throw up on an almost daily basis, or everytime I eat junk food or a lot of calories. I used to fast for hours/days but I am no-longer able to keep myself doing that, plus I will feint if I go without food for too long.   


I have been trying to fight my binging by:  
\- Allowing myself to binge : I don't ever stop....for months I don't get bored of these foods.   
\- Drinking more water.  
\- Eating ice.   
\- HUGE meals : I just binge anyway.   
\- Varied diet or strict diet   
\- More protein or fiber or content.   
\- Only filling my bowl : I just refill the bowl.   
\- Distractions/keeping busy  
\- Sugar-free   
\- Protein shakes and soups  


I REALLY want to get help and honestly not being able to reach my doctor has made this way worse. I feel so much more depressed and helpless everyday now. My doc will only take appointments at 8am and EVERYONE in town calls at 8am, I am working at that time and now allowed my phone or allowed to take an hour to wait on hold.

604,eating_disorders,"Hi. I'm 18 F, almost 19.

So I'm kind of nervous about the next month. I'm moving back home from college fir winter break and I've had my eating patterns set and I've been in a sort of routine that I will change for a day, I've done that about 3 times in the last 4 months that I've lived at college, and I am scared about how they will be affected when I go back home. 

I have been aware of my eating disorder since I was 14 and I've been dealing with it for the past 4 almost 5 years. I know I have ednos. I have pica when I was a child for about 7 years. 

I'm mainly afraid of what I'm going to do when I go back home because my mother and older sister kind if just do what they want which I don't care about, but that also means that I will either come home to a pantry full of foods that are very unhealthy or super high in sodium and sugar, or I'll go home a a completely empty pantry and fridge. 

Since I am going gone for winter break, that means we will have a Christmas dinner at my own home then go to my grandparents house for dinner with them and I can never really get over my nerves when there because my grandfather has always made comments on my body and my sisters body since I was about 12 and her 16. I know my sister doesn't pay much mind to it, but I am so scares of him commenting on my body.

611,eating_disorders,"Hi all, 

I apologize if this isn't the right place for this. I don't know where else to go. I'm also on mobile so apologies for any mistakes.

I have struggled with disordered eating since I was in high school. I'm an adult now, working through my ED with a therapist and trying to build a better relationship with food and my body. Overall, I think I've been doing really well. 

I have a really wonderful friend (known them for 3 years) who also has a history of ED. They relapsed within the last several months and their bulimia (binging, purging cycle) has really, really escalated within the last few weeks. 

I feel at a loss for how to support them while also being mindful of myself. They don't have any supports outside of me (no friends, really crummy family) and have been really traumatized by the mental health system. I have an amazing relationship with them and they feel like I'm the only person they can talk to about what's going on without being shamed or invalidated. 

I want to keep creating a safe place for them to talk. I want to validate their experiences and feelings because I know, from personal experience, it's not something they can just ""get over"" or ""think more positively"" about. 

But it's also been months. The only avenue I can see to disrupting this cycle is treatment or therapy but they absolutely refuse. I understand why (the trauma from previous mental health treatment) but they also keep coming to me, asking for help in disrupting the cycle or looking for advice to find distractions or other coping mechanisms. The longer this goes on, the more triggered and beat down I feel. I truly don't think there's anything more I can do for them. 

I worry about what will happen if I put distance between us. They don't have anyone else. But I also feel like I can't keep sitting with them and watching them sink further and further into the disorder. They're my friend and it hurts to watch but it's also really triggering and I'm having ED thoughts that I haven't had in years. 

Sorry for the rant. I don't even know if what I said makes sense. I guess I'm just looking for advice or validation or something. Is just being a caring person and listening ear enough? Should I be doing more? If I pull back from the relationship and the ED escalates even more, is that my fault?",,My friend's bulimia has escalated and I don't know what to do.,1,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,zerx1r,1,ConcernedFriendAlt,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/zerx1r/my_friends_bulimia_has_escalated_and_i_dont_know/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/zerx1r/my_friends_bulimia_has_escalated_and_i_dont_know/,1670387142,419,0,0,0,-1,1,Friend with a history of ED who is currently experiencing a relapse and escalating bulimia,neutral,"The writer is feeling triggered and beat down from providing support, The friend doesn't have any other supports outside of the writer, The friend is traumatized by previous mental health treatment and refuses therapy, The writer is worried about the consequences of putting distance between them and their friend","Being the only support system for a friend with a relapse of bulimia, friend refusing therapy due to past trauma",neutral,"The writer is feeling triggered and experiencing ED thoughts, The writer is struggling to balance being a supportive friend and taking care of their own mental health, The writer is unsure of how to best support their friend and is considering pulling back from the relationship",Friend with a history of ED seeking support from the writer who is also in ED recovery,neutral,"The writer is experiencing triggers and negative effects on their own ED recovery while providing support to their friend, The friend is resistant to seeking treatment or therapy despite escalating symptoms"

617,eating_disorders,"I’ve been struggling with anorexia for 6 years now and I am 20 years old. I’ve been through multiple relapses but this one has been the worst and physically I’m not in a good place. 

I’ve once again started the “recovery” process, but this time I am taking a much different approach (more of harm reduction and a much slower pace). I have increased my food, added more variety to my diet and am working on myself and mindset everyday (which has been a huge challenge in itself). I posted a photo on my Instagram for my birthday which has now circulated around my extended family (who have not seen me in this state) and it is a shit show. 

They are all calling/texting my parents blaming and shaming us. They believe I need to be in a hospital and questioning how my parents let it get this bad. It makes me sick to my stomach because this illness has absolutely destroyed my parents and it kills them to see me like this, and now they are dealing with all this. They are doing everything they can to be there for me and help/support me in the best way for me. They don’t understand that throwing me into treatment/in the hospital will not magically cure me. They don’t understand that “just eating” will not make everything go away.

I think the most frustrating thing is in the past years when I looked “healthy” no one cared. No one cared if I was so depressed and uncomfortable with my body and hated myself. All because I “looked healthy”.
That’s the thing people don’t understand about anorexia, it’s a MENTAL ILLNESS. 
Trust me, me and my family have tried everything. No one has the right to judge our decisions. I feel like I can’t even show myself at family get togethers now, I don’t even feel welcome at this point because of the judgment.

What kills me the most is the blame being put on my parents, especially since I am 20 YEARS OLD. People expect them to fix it and ask “why are you not doing anything”. Well, because they CANT. No one can force you to recover. The only way recovery works is if you choose it yourself. 

It kills me to see my parents not only dealing with a sick daughter and doing there absolute best to be there and support me (which they have been amazing at) but are now dealing with all the judgment and drama of other people thinking they know what’s best/right when they haven’t even dealt with it before.

619,eating_disorders,"I hate my body so much. Like to the point that I'm literally angry. When I look in the mirror and see my double chin I push up into my jaw until it hurts. I do the same with my stomach. Everytime I eat I think about how stupid I am for putting more in my body and when I try to eat healthy I have to gag it down because apparently I'm a five year old who can't eat their vegetables. I'm about to just stop eating altogether bc then at least I'll be skinny once before I die. 

Not actually tho. And I wanna say it's because I know how ridiculous and unhealthy that sounds, but It's also bc I know that binge eating disorder will take hold again so I might as well just not fight it. I'm tired tho. Really tired. Idk what advice you guys could give me besides what I already know. I know how to be healthy. Fruits, veggies, whole grain, water, nothing that tastes really good, exercise, personal hygiene, all that shit. 

I guess if any of you have ever dealt with these feelings towards yourself, how you dealt with that? I don't hate my personality, mind, or soul. But I hate my body with a rage that just sits in my chest constantly. If I could watch somebody throw my body in a vat of acid without being in my body or feeling it I'd gladly sit and watch. Good riddance. I hate it. But I don't want to keep feeling this way. 

Sorry if this came off all angsty, I don't want to sound dramatic but I guess I am being dramatic?

622,eating_disorders,"I have always been insecure about my weight. The first time I can remember being self conscious about my body was when I was probably 8 or 9 years old. My friend and I were about to go swimming and her stepdad poked my stomach and told me I had “fat rolls”.

All throughout high school I was quite thin. I played sports, but still obsessed over my eating and struggled with bulimia. Once I got to college, I gained about 50 pounds over a 4 year span. I was completely out of control. My weight absolutely consumed my life and I felt so low. It was all I could think about, but I just kept gaining weight. Finally, I had enough. In July I started a diet and really stuck to it. I was losing weight really fast and became obsessed with it. To the point where I was barely eating and losing half a pound to a pound a day. I wasn’t having my period, losing my hair, irritable, etc. I ended up losing about 40 pounds in 3 months. I was getting a lot of “you look skinny” “you look like you’ve lost weight” “you look really good!” Which just fueled the fire, I became obsessed with people noticing I was losing weight. I was supposed to lose 20 more pounds to reach my weight loss goal, but I lost the self discipline. The last 2 months I have maybe lost 7 pounds. The thought of losing more weight has consumed my life. It has never been this bad. It’s all I can think about. If I don’t eat for a day, I look in the mirror and think about how skinny I look. If I eat a meal and feel like it was too much, I look in the mirror and I think I look overweight again. I know it’s my mind playing tricks, but I hate how my mind effects what I see in the mirror. It is effecting my relationship with my boyfriend my family. I hate this relationship I have with food and how it’s all I can think about. I NEED it to get better because I feel like i’m spiraling out of control. Do I lose the 20 more pounds to reach my goal? I’m afraid if I continue the diet I won’t be able to stop, even after I reach my goal. At the same time, the thought of me losing more weight makes me so excited. I really feel like I need help,

623,eating_disorders,"TW: calories,weight and restricting (no #s at all)

I’ve been fully recovered for a few. I suppose physically recovered would be a better term as the mental part is still very much a part of my life. I’m not required to keep gaining weight anymore but I have been, I’ve been binging every other day for quite awhile now. I don’t mean like “oh my god I ate like enough calories today to let my bodies organs work” it’s more like double my maintenance. Sometimes it’s not that bad and it’s just like a bit over my maintenance but regardless it freaks me out. I’ve gained almost in the double digits of unnecessary pounds after weight restoration and am almost out of my weight range. For context I am quite short so it is quite a bit of weight on me. I’m actually hungry when I’m having these binges and I know my metabolisms not just crazy fast because I’m gaining weight. I’m already relapsing and have been trying to restrict for a couple weeks now which hasn’t worked at all (thankfully and not so thankfully) I’ve lost the discipline to restrict. Have any others experienced this? I don’t know if I should listen to my hunger ques or try for a healthy weight loss or just counting for maintenance. I’m really tempted to just hardcore relapse but I don’t want to go down that path again, it split my family apart and was absolutely horrible. It would just be so comfortable and I would feel so good though. What do I do, is this normal? Am I turning into a binge eater? I’m sorry for the long rant, I’m not able to tell anyone in my personal life as they will become concerned and take away a lot of the privileges I have gotten back.

624,eating_disorders,"Welp I guess were here now. I just realized a lot of things. For context, my girlfriend suffers from bulimia and it got worse recently. We have talked a lot about it, as much as she allowed to. We talked about what we can do together to minimize her binging and part of that was not to buy snacks when we meet up, which we did a lot. We bought so many snacks and sugary food and we both ate a lot. 
Heads up: I don't understand everything and I'm trying to understand bulimia, but I'm not there yet. I'm not dealing with this in a healthy way, which I'm gonna have therapy for.
The thought that wanders my mind constantly is: just stop purging. Stupid, right? Why am I thinking that. Why does it seem so easy to me? Bc I don't purge. Huh. Wait...I was binging together with her. Huh. I guess I was happy about it bc I didn't feel alone. Damn, I was eating so fucking much when I was younger, up until in my twenties. It only stopped for now bc my medicine kills my appetite. Damn, I check all the boxes for binge eating when I am stuck and I defend my actions, I'm really mad when someone talks about my eating. And stopping binging with her makes me sad? Wtf. Welp, I think I got to the bottom of a lot of things today. 
The thing is, for someone who gave up on loosing weight and just who just stopped caring, it's hard to hear how my girlfriend and her best friend (also bulimic) talks about gaining weight. They're terrified. And there I am, an overweight person with the body fat they are terrified of. I know it's selfish, they told me it's just about themselves and not others. I think it triggered that sad little girl who was bullied for her weight and constantly shamed for gainig weight. Suddenly I'm terrified too. Here's the thing tho which terrifies me: I stopped eating. Due to stress I suffer from extreme nausea which prevents me from eating. But, I stopped getting hungry, and not eating doesn't make me feel more ill. I keep trying out how long I can go without eating. Why is this happening. I want to nourish my body but it doesn't work.

626,eating_disorders,"I hate eating disorders. I hate subs and pages and people that encourage it. I’ve dealt with an eating disorder since i was 12 and it has never left. I can never get rid of it. It’s like a body eating and mind eating parasite that infects. I hate how eating disorders are seen as dumb and stupid and only for teenage girls and it’s not that serious. 

I dropped a lot of weight over covid, down to my lowest I’ve ever been (110). Wanted to recover got up to 120, gained 5 pounds. I’m miserable at this weight. I feel fat and disgusting and a slob. I feel such embarrassment and shame everytime I eat. I’ve destroyed my digestive system. It’s completely ruined. 

People have commented on my weight since i was young. one of my friends that I thought i would trust with the information that I’ve struggled with my weight, since they struggle with theirs, will make off handed comments towards my eating. Or even me mentioning food. 

I’ve never been big big, maybe a little chubby but that’s it. I don’t judge others for the weight they gain, or how they eat, what they eat. I think having more meat on your bones is attractive, just not on me. I don’t like when others shame  people for their weight, I think it’s rude and disgusting and not for others t decide.

All I do is body check, all I do is think about my ed lately. I have a mix of other mental things wrong but this one’s been all I can think about .

I don’t have many people i ccan talk to. I just needed to rant. I can’t afford to gain weight for the sake of my mental state. I can’t afford to be weak and brail and barely stand for 10 minutes. 

I can’t feel pretty any other way. I’m not conveniently attractive, me having weight on makes me uglier. I hate the feeling of fat on my body. 

People like to romanticize this disorder a lot and I understand it’s a privilege to withhold food from yourself (1st world problems) but it’s awful. It’s one of the many hells I’ve created for myself.

627,eating_disorders,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this so apologies if its not. Some backstory, I've struggled with food forever, but after the 'freshman-15' being more like 'freshman-30', my body changed drastically and I developed very restrictive eating habits after that year. I lost it but gained it right back when I started binging again. Ever since then I'd tried countless diets, going back and forth between binging and restricting. Overtime, I kept gaining, until recently. I was looking at old pictures where I was much smaller and remembering that when I saw the picture then, I thought I looked huge...it was kind of an epiphany realizing that my body was never the issue and the common denominator is me.

So I really focused on healing my relationship with food and being body neutral. And having done that for about 2 years, I mostly eat when I'm hungry now, not really caring about food. Now that I'm not binging, I have started to lose weight and this morning my pants fit significantly looser. But with that, I feel like my restrictive thoughts are coming back and suddenly I fear gaining again, which I haven't for a while. I'm so nervous that this is going to spiral and I'd be right back where I started, miserable and hating my body - no matter what it looks like.

630,eating_disorders,"Some context, I’m a Bodybuilder that tracks calories and usually eats extremely clean while eating out but I don’t lack foods like ice cream, cake, etc, I actually have them a lot but homemade 99% of the time so I know what goes into it, and I can log my macros in accordance with my goals.

So here’s the weird thing I’ve been bulking for about three months now, to the extent food is pretty much sickening, I track calories, all that jazz and never give much thought to wanting a desert or anything; and if I do I just make it at home so I can track accurately. 

Two nights ago my friend psychoanalyzed me while I went out to eat with her and another buddy, we got American sushi and I actually had a large plate(6~ rolls) and hit my calories there for the day, and frankly anymore food sounded terrible. She insisted that we get ice cream shortly after, so we drive over to a shop but I didn’t want any, and she was not having it whatsoever. Insisting that I even get a kids size, I was full beyond imagination and didn’t want to turn my lean bulk too dirty, given I was just out of town for a few days prior and I had an early thanksgiving tomorrow(she was not aware of the early thanksgiving). 

Fast forward next day, I’m celebrating thanksgiving with my family early since most of us will be out of town, and I have never once over thought food so much in my life, the night before she was saying how much I miss out in life by not enjoying myself, despite me having all the foods anyone would typically crave like ice cream, cake, etc, already having macro friendly version(not volume just lower cal/no shitty ingredients and pro) and I had what I suppose is a binge, probably close to 10,000 calories with tons of pie, and the day after nearly the same. So I’ve probably put on 2lbs+ of fat as a result, and need to mini cut for 40~ days, and I’m hoping I can just do it for 20 with fasted cardio, but I just feel like this is the start to a terrible disorder. I don’t want to blame her but everything she said wouldn’t stop fucking echoing in my mind two days ago, I know she cares about me and is just looking out for me, but I just want to distance myself entirely, I just want to stick in line with my goals. Why can’t those around you sometimes understand that? Friends and family knows how much bodybuilding and everything it entails matters to me, but why did she(and I suppose others in the past) have to label what I do as such a bad practice I have no problem with?

Am I just hiding and coping an eating disorder yet I felt completely normal till two days ago with that barrage of conversation?

635,eating_disorders,"Hello,
I'm 15 years old and I'm trying to recover from anorexia in an outpatient setting at the moment. Since October 21st, I've been slowly increasing my calorie intake from &lt;100kcal/d to 1200kcal/d. But since I kept losing weight on that, I was told to immediately jump to 3000+ kcal by my psychiatrist this Monday. And that's what I tried to do in the days that followed. However, I've gained an abnormal amount of weight so far: 

     Monday: 2500kcal — +0.6kg
     Tuesday: 1200kcal — -0.5kg
     Wednesday: 3100kcal — +0.8kg
     Thursday: 2600kcal (burned 500) — +0.4kg

So in total I gained 1.3kg within 4 days!!! And it'a definitely not just food weight; My thighs and arms have become so much bigger and my face looks fat now. To be honest I don't know what to do anymore. I know that I have to gain weight but I never would have thought that this would happen so quickly!! Why is this happening? And what shall I do now? I'm expected to gain 700g per WEEK. Will lowering my intake help to slow the weight gain down? I mentally cannot handle seeing the number on the scale going up at such a tremendous rate.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 months now (we know eachother for 1,5 year) and I am very happy with him. We both have meme accounts and that’s how we met lol.

He loves me a lot and he continues to show me that. However, I am a very insecure girl who’s had anorexia and a binge eating disorder. We had multiple fights about his instagram following cause he used to follow a lot of girls with insane bodies, a lot of celebirties that were either insanely skinny or had a BBL etc. It made me so so insecure, He ended up unfollowing them (he didn’t want to the first time cause he thought I was controlling) but I genuinely didn’t wanna eat for days if I just realised I didn’t look like any of those girls.

His ex is also very beautiful and very skinny, that also makes me super insecure, I compare myself to her all the time (thought this was worth mentioning) but I have to say it’s getting less and less by day.

Now we watched squid game together and he has been posting memes about the attractive actress in it which just gave me raging thoughts, how does he even know her name? It means he looked her up I suppose, now I’m just on the tip of about to cry in my room cause I just think i’ll never be good enough for him and that I also need to lose weight. Me and my eating disorder are so mad at him at the moment, it makes me wanna break up with him. Maybe I’m just not ready for a boyfriend 

I know I’m being crazy right now and I don’t know what to do with myself :( one side of me just wants to cry about it all day, not eat, and ignore him for the rest f the day and the other side maybe wants to tell him?

652,eating_disorders,"i posted this and then realized the title was absolutely Not Helpful to what the content contained at all, so i'm reposting it (even with the updated title i'm sure it's not helpful at all, sorry :( )

i'm not really sure how to start this off, so i'll just dump a few things. i'm 16f, 5'4 and a half, and recently weighed myself and saw i was 99 lbs. my mom said that i needed to eat more, and for awhile, made meals for me so i could try and regain the weight. i've always been a bit of a picky eater, but the meals she was cooking for me were ones i liked/was okay with. however, i was still unable to finish them. i do take vyvanse, which apparently lowers your appetite, so that probably has something to do with it. however, when my mom made fewer and fewer meals, i started to fail to see the reason as to why i should gain weight.

i began liking the numbers on the scale, and now i look forward to seeing if the numbers have dropped. i've never really had any hobbies or talents or anything to brag about, which has always made me feel bad, but now i feel like i finally have something to say about myself.

my friends tell me to tell my mom about how i may have an eating disorder (unsure as to whether or not this is true, i feel bad saying that i do even though all signs point to one because i'm aware self diagnosing is bad) and i know that this is a really bad situation and i should tell her so i can try and get help, but it's like i'm addicted to the feeling of knowing i finally have something to say about myself. every morning i'm almost *excited* to go weigh myself, anticipating whether the numbers have dropped even further. as of right now, my weight has stayed the same (\~99 lbs) which i'm not sure how is possible because i haven't eaten in 2 days, and as of tomorrow, it'll be 3 days. the hunger pangs are rare, but when they do come, they're intense. but, when i stand up to go drink water so i can trick myself into feeling full, the hunger disappears completely. this has been happening even before i realized i weighed 99 lbs, probably even for years.

it's confusing - sometimes when i look in the mirror i get scared. i don't look severely underweight at first glance, but my ribs stand out when i inhale and you can slightly see the ridges in my sternum on my chest. my back is a lot worse, though. my scapulas and ribs are a lot more prominent. my hipbones also jut out a lot, but then again they always have so i can't tell a difference in how they looked before and how they look now.

for some reason, while i know i should tell my mom, i just... can't. i do have diagnosed anxiety and adhd, but i'm not sure if that's what's holding me back, or if it's just shame or embarrassment. it's hard to describe this accurately, but it almost feels like i'm a drug addict confessing to my parents about how i think i need help.

the problem? my dad is *really* stingy with money. it's not as if we're poor, we could afford treatment if i needed it, but he's obsessed with saving money. he constantly keeps watch over our credit card payments and is always asking who bought what (i have two older brothers). he also always thinks i'm exaggerating. not sure how to word it, but an example would be how keys were falling off of my laptop. i asked if i could go to the apple store to get it fixed, and he refused, asking if my mom and i had ""even bothered to try to do it ourselves first."" we had, but he always assumes the worst of everyone. and he's constantly saying i don't need my glasses and that i was just making things up for attention. even then, he hasn't spoken a word to me since september 2nd, so there's that.

my mom is also influenced by him, whether she realizes it or not. she's definitely a lot more lenient, and i love her, but she's really controlling. you can tell she likes being a mother, that she likes having her children rely on her. and i get the brunt her care, now that both of my brothers are in college while i'm still in high school. she wants the best for me, but she's easily swayed by my dad's opinion. i feel like she's a shell of who she used to be, who she was before she got married to my dad.

i bring up the topic of my parents because i'm not sure they'll let me get treatment. as i said, my dad's obsessed with saving money and fixing things himself, so i'm sure that if i tell my mom, she'll tell him, he'll think i'm exaggerating, and if i keep up the ""act"" my mom will just make more meals for me which i can't even eat because i'm constantly nauseous.

i'm not really sure what i want this post to be. i guess it's more of a vent than anything, but advice would be appreciated considering i'm dying and there's literally no solution to this

660,eating_disorders,"I’ve [25F] struggled with eating disorders all my life. When I was a teen I didn’t eat until I was a certain weight. When I gained weight I would throw up. I was never “too thin” though always on the last number for a healthy weight for my height. Depression from breakups or the death of my grandfather who raised me and in my eyes was my father were the only two instances where I “naturally” became underweight. The depression was awful of course, and both circumstances I struggled with alcohol abuse and self-harm….but boy was I skinny. The doctors notes telling me I was underweight, the comments from people in my life, a mixture of I look great and I look too thin we’re almost orgasmic. The depression was crippling but the being so skinny was addicting? I’ve always managed to keep my life together due to childhood trauma and fear of not succeeding and being poor. I have a masters degree and make 114k a year at 25 years old because I never stopped working so hard, through the losses, the alcohol, the anorexia, and self-harm. I never stopped working. I’m a high functioning piece of shit. 

Fast forward and I live the “dream life” I’m engaged to be married in two weeks to the love of my life. He’s so wonderful. We bought a 5,100 square foot beautiful home in the suburbs and want to start a family. I am healthy 95% of the time besides constantly worrying and obsessing over my weight. 130 pounds 5’4. I’m so disgusted every single day. I don’t drink much anymore but when I do after a long day there is something so incredibly comforting about the MESS! I’ll sit in my car and drink tequila and convince myself to stop eating. Listen to my favorite sad music, sometimes even go to the bathroom, throw up and cut myself in discreet places my fiancé won’t notice. Fantasize about my bones sticking out again and being so thin I look sick. It’s so incredibly comforting and I feel like I’m home and this is right and where I belong. I l love myself and have hope.

Then it’s the next day. I know I have to work, not drink, eat, and be healthy and it sucks. I hate myself and I’m fat and ugly.

661,eating_disorders,"i’ve struggled with a concoction of eating disorders from age 12-present. i’ve been diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia and ednos because i literally take any and every route possible, depending on the day. 
i’ve always been a bit bigger because of my body shape and bone structure- i also have a hormonal condition that causes weight to stick pretty hard. unfortunately i’m one of those cases where unless you physically see my relationship with food you wouldn’t know i have an eating disorder. even my mom still doesn’t believe i do, even though i restrict heavily, starve myself, purge, abuse laxatives/hydroxycut, and over exercise. i’ve been to treatment, fainted in the gym more times than i can count. it’s had a hold on me since was so young. 
the thing is once i got to age 20 i was able to get a hold on my eating disorder because it was destroying my life, and through therapy and a nutritionist was able to start eating in a way that works for me. the thing is though, i gained about 30 pounds and now weigh 160… so last year my mom suggested i get a gastric bypass (she’s very fatphobic, and was 110 lbs most of her life and won’t accept that i’ve destroyed my body with eating disorders). my ED brain took it seriously so i made a consultation to get a gastric bypass where they laughed at me and immediately told me that I don’t qualify in the slightest and that if I want to lose weight I can exercise and eat right. it really broke my heart because my mom somehow had me totally convinced i actually needed the procedure. my body dysmorphia makes it to where i can’t gauge my appearance so i thought i may be valid. that was triggering- i relapsed, went back to therapy, back to square 1. was able to manage my weight for about a year, until recently when my sister told me my mother was constantly talking about how i’m going to die young because i’m morbidly obese, so i relapsed again 3 weeks ago. as of right now it’s only been purging and some restricting; but i just ordered a 6 month supply of hydroxycut as well as those garbage diet teas, and i plan on stocking back up on laxatives and over exercising again… i’d rather be seen as a valid human being even if it means i get really sick again…. i need help. i don’t know where to turn. i can’t turn to my parents because they never saw my eating disorder as valid because i never got lighter than 120 lbs. my mom supposedly tells my family i faked it all, despite having gone to treatment twice and having official diagnoses. 
i don’t know if i’m just ranting or what i think i’m going to gain. i think i just need to discuss this with people who understand. i just want to recover but i’m scared i never will

663,eating_disorders,"I suffer from quite a restrictive ed, and i was hungry so i thought baking would make me feel better &amp; i could be around food too- win win. 

I adore autumn &amp; cooking So part of me wanted to actually eat the autumn things i was baking- but ofc my head is screaming at me not too. 

My head was telling me i was strong enough to resist  the food, all what it usually would say; demonising the food. And i was ok with that- happy, because it means i was 'strong'.

Id offered one to everyone and then they were sat there for an hour.
 i had been debating wether i wanted to have one myself &amp; if it was worth all the pain i knew would follow, but in the moment it seemed manageable and alright and like i should just eat it and enjoy it like i would have years ago. 

So I had one. AND. made the dinner id planned for myself. I couldnt finish it but I kept myself distracted until i was completely done eating because i knew the thoughts would become loud enough soon and honestly just Could Not Be bothereeed!!! to deal w them. 

I ate that cupcake and a bit of a brownie id been thinking about all day and it wasnt even worth it. 
i could only enjoy it for about 10 seconds in the moment and what followed certainly was not worth it. 

I just proceeded to compulsivley excersize until 1am and sobbed about it until i got too tired to be awake. And did *everything* i could think of to counter act. 

The thoughts of worthlessness &amp; that id made my entire ed up, that i was a fake and this is why all my friends hated or would leave me. I felt like id binged and was disgraceful. (i know its not binging though)

That i didn't deserve to be alive or to waste anyones time because id lied to them and caused so much drama for no reason &amp; that i was a disgusting manipulative person and all these horrible things just would. not. stop. 

I feel like its not even worth maybe in the future trying to recover if i decide too. i feel like i'm stuck this way. 

Id been having a pretty tough week w my ed and MANY big life changes in general.
And in the past (pre ed), food would b a big comfort. - Not to the point where it was a problem, id always been lucky to be v skinny so it never felt an issue.
But yrs later its turned into the enemy completely. i feel like ill never enjoy food again. 

And even worse im still convinced i faked my ed and that someone who was really ill would never have ate what i did. 

But then part of me still rationalises it &amp; thinks that maybe im not lying because they wouldn't behave so strongly and have so much mental pain after eating it. it would be normal. 

Its such a trap. I dont even know what i think or feel anymore i just regret it enormously. 

Does anyone else ever feel like there faking or made it all up if they do something like that. 
Have I made my entire ed up??? or am i like just too deep in to even realise. i don't even know anymore. This is so so lonely.

No one in my family eat meat so I have to eat it from outside, everyone here knows that indian street food is not at all healthy *please don't take it as an offense indians* . I end up eating a lot of street food, there was a time when days used to pass by without me eating home-cooked healthy food. There were days when I used to eat street food* as breakfast, lunch and dinner. Whenever I eat anything unhealthy or meat after I am done eating I am stuck by this huge wave of guilt, then I promise myself I won't do it again and I end up relapsing the next day. Gradually my health started taking toll .I developed h pylori bacteria and was diagnosed with dyspepsia as well as haemorrhoids. I have tried to improve my eating habits and have come to a point where I eat street food once every 2-3 days. I am on medical but still can't stop myself from eating shit. My health is degrading, I don't do any excercise and because of all this everything else in my life is getting affected . I have tried a lot to eat healthy whenever I try to put a vegetable or a fruit other than apple and watermelon I end up almost vomiting but I can drink fruit and vegetable smoothies but then they are not fulfilling and I get hungry after an hour or so. I don't hate my body, I am a little bit overweight its just that I hate what I have done to my body at such a young age. Please help!

hi, i’ve been struggling with ed behaviours (not been diagnosed with an ed as have never spoken about it to a doctor) for quite a while now - it’s been on off since i was 13 but it’s gotten to the worse it’s ever been recently. my friend has not too long ago came out and said that she also believes she may have an ed - hers being based around purging while mine being more restrictive.
when she first came out to me saying she was struggling, i wasn’t that bad and felt that it was okay that she shared things with me that are potentially triggering like weight, calories, etc. but recently i have been getting really bad in terms of restricting and have now picked up purging behaviours which she has previously told me about. and because i have previously said that it was okay to speak about triggering things, she no longer checks with me to make sure that im okay with hearing it so just blurts out things that now trigger me. i don’t know how to tell her to stop as i don’t want her to feel like she has made me worse and she has previously said that she had a sense of relief having someone to talk to about it as she feels i am the only person she can be open with who will understand her. i don’t want her to go through this hard time she’s having alone but at the same time being there for her is making me worse.

How can I support them without triggering them? What are some things I can do to check on them without seeming invasive? What kinds of things can I say to make them feel better? What things should I avoid saying around them?

he recently decided that he wanted to lose weight, which is ok.
but i started noticing he wasn’t eating that much and i asked him about his new diet.

turns out he eats 1100 kcal a day.
he is a 5’11 30yo man.

i tried talking to him so many times, explaining the medical reasons and why this is so unhealthy. he agrees with my statement but doesn’t want to change a thing.

i tried sending him some stuff from the internet explaining how this is wrong and what he should do if he wants to lose weight in a healthy way

nothing works. i’m a 16yo girl and i feel so sad watching this happening. i told the rest of the family about this, they don’t seem to be concerned. 

what should i do? i feel like i’m watching him dying in front of me?

Today they told me their weight and made a joke about how fat they felt. But the thing is that their weight is lesser than the recommended for people of their height
So I couldn't ignore it anymore, I told them that I was very worried about them and that if they wanted to talk about how they felt I would always listen. They acknowledge that they have an unhealthy relationship with food but then they changed suddenly the subject and never talked about that anymore.

687,eating_disorders,"(17F) So I’ve recently started feeling really sick whenever I think about eating food. I also recently transitioned to stop eating dairy and fast/fried food due to my tonsil stones, and not eating meat anymore due to health benefits. I really like to eat healthy, and if I have a choice between eating a food that I deem as health or not eating at all, I won’t eat at all. I sometimes struggle with eating because of this reason, and my mom sometimes doesn’t buy me groceries when she’s angry with me. When she does, she leaves ingredients out of recipes I want so I can’t eat the meal I want at all. I try to eat a balanced diet, and when I overeat or eat something I shouldn’t have I feel really sick or about myself. I think about food a lot. I just vacationed this week, and I was so excited to try the food, but every good I have tried is either gross or makes me nauseous. I get really full quickly, but I still order entrees which makes me feel guilty when I leave a lot of food on the plate. I’ve now transitioned to just getting appetizers. I mainly like to just eat snacks all day if I could, but healthy ones like nature basket fig bars or made food mixed berry bars.

689,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone. I’m currently just looking for some advice to support a guy i'm currently dating who has an eating disorder.

I've recently been dating a guy and feel that we've found a great connection and honestly just looking for some advice on how to deal with the different traits that come with spending time with somebody who has an ED. (makes jokes about his bulimia to me, self deprecating, insecure, needy, feels disgusting, needs reassurance, mental health/negative intrusive thoughts, damaged by past relationship etc) - i really don't mind the neediness or anything, but i'm unsure and confused whether i'm helping or hindering this guy by pursuing a relationship when he may be in a difficult headspace to handle a relationship.

Since we started dating we're inseparable and super close. he has openly explained he wants to be 100% honest with me that he has mental health issues/negative intrusive thoughts and an eating disorder(bulimia) .

Recently we were planning for me to stay over at his apartment, but he expressed he was super nervous for me to stay over with him for a few days because he feels insecure and gross knowing i'm there while he's binging and purging.

He was in a really bad headspace since his last relationship ended as the ex was mentally damaging for him, calling him worthless and all kinds of mind games - his ex cheated on him numerous times and made him feel like he wasn't deserving of love or that was just how relationships were. being treated awfully was normal for him.

 I am genuinely into this guy and honestly feel like we are soulmates. The affection we both give each other and the interests we share etc. I don't want to come across like a life saviour because everybody has to be somewhat independent and comfortable enough to not rely on their partner to get them through life. that being said, I am still going to be supportive to somebody i'm close with.

He told me he has medication for his mental health, &amp; purging all of the food he binges comforts him because it makes him feel ""less fat"" and ""its a way of purging the negativity out of him"" which made me super sad. although since we started talking/dating, he has let me know that i have personally made him so hopeful of the future and helped massively, and i've made such a positive change in him. i told him people are all going through their own personal issues and it's okay and 100% valid to feel these things. it sucks but time and surrounding yourself with positivity will help you heal more and more each day.

i expressed that i like him no matter what and i’m 100% there for him if he needs any support and in no way am i judgmental because i know everyone has their own struggles and issues in life. I let him know all of his qualities are attractive and perfect for me. i told him i am in no way a therapist or consultant for these types of things but i am sensitive to the subject and appreciate it’s a difficult thing alongside some mental issues

i do 100% believe we would be great together and told him sensitively that none of his personal issues define him.

I'm just concerned because i’ve really not experienced supporting or handling being around somebody with an eating disorder. he makes jokes about being bulimic and i awkwardly change the subject and try not to let it be the topic of conversation.

he’s scared of change (new city, new job, dating etc) and always is running away back to his family home because he committed everything to his last relationship which ended in signing a 12 month apartment contract for this guy he thought he would be with forever - that’s why he runs away back home, because he hates living there alone especially with his negative thoughts and place he associates with his toxic ex.

he drinks a lot of sugar free fizzy drinks after food/binging so that he can purge easier and tries to normalise the behaviour by saying he’s had himself checked out with a camera in his system and he’s all good, so sees no reason why he shouldn't continue purging. i’ve been left an hour or two at a time each night on the sofa while he purges and i feel awkward sitting around while i can hear him doing all of this in the bathroom.

i would eventually like to talk to him about getting professional help but don’t want to pressure him because i know the topic of conversation is a touchy one. sorry about the huge paragraphs, hopefully somebody can give me some advice.",,Dating somebody with an ED / Support Advice?,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,pdkn7b,1,jjrck96,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/pdkn7b/dating_somebody_with_an_ed_support_advice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/pdkn7b/dating_somebody_with_an_ed_support_advice/,1630194630,798,0,0,0,-1,1,Support from the partner,neutral,"The writer is providing emotional support to their partner who has an eating disorder and mental health issues, The writer is unsure if they are helping or hindering their partner by pursuing a relationship, The partner makes jokes about their bulimia and feels insecure and gross when their partner is present while they are binging and purging, The partner has negative intrusive thoughts and is damaged from their past relationship, The partner drinks sugar-free fizzy drinks to purge easier and tries to normalize the behavior",Dating someone with an eating disorder who is in a difficult headspace,neutral,"The person with the eating disorder is self-deprecating, insecure, and needy, and makes jokes about their bulimia, The person is scared of change and runs away to their family home to escape their negative thoughts and toxic ex, They drink a lot of sugar-free fizzy drinks to purge more easily",Supporting a partner with an eating disorder and mental health issues,neutral,"The writer is unsure if they are helping or hindering their partner by pursuing a relationship, The partner makes jokes about their bulimia and has self-deprecating and insecure behavior, The partner feels gross and insecure when binging and purging in front of the writer, The partner has been damaged by past relationships and has negative intrusive thoughts, The partner drinks a lot of sugar-free fizzy drinks to purge easier, The writer wants to eventually talk to the partner about getting professional help"

The thing is, I’ve had food problems for 6 years now. The difference between now and then is that I was 120 pounds when I was really struggling. They thought I was just looking for attention, that I didn’t have a problem. That I wanted to go to therapy because it was what all my friends were doing. They thought that this was something I would just get over. I was not noticeably skinny so they thought I was fine. 

I’ve teetered around 110-125 in the past few years. 132 being my highest. I’m 5’2. The problems started when I was 15. I’m 21 now. 

Earlier this year I was switched to a new birth control pill. It made me go from 108 to 116 in a month. I was disgusted with myself. I tried to hard to lose the weight to no avail. I was also chewing and spitting at this time. I would lock myself in my room and chew and spit for hours. Spending $200 every few days on more food to spit. When I came home from college I weighed 115. I couldn’t believe I let myself get that high again. I tried exercise and reducing my calorie intake to lower my weight. I was still 116. I stopped weighing myself. I don’t weigh myself much anymore. In mid-June I was finally down to 112. 

I got curious the other day. I stepped on the scale, expecting to see 113. I’m 103. When did this happen? There no way for me to know. I didn’t even try. How did I lose 9 pounds in less than 2 months. My parents are onto me. However, now, I think I’m fine. Sure, I don’t eat as much as I used to, but I’m still eating. I don’t chew and spit as much. Now that I am noticeably skinny they care. My mom told me today that I have an eating disorder. Not like she even knows. Why is it that now she cares but when I was heavier and struggling it was for attention? My mom cried today because she thinks I’m going to die. They don’t want me to go back to college.

i’m not of legal age yet and i still live with my family - none of them know i’ve been restricting my eating or even tracking it, and that’s become a bit of an issue. i’m always incredibly stressed whenever i have to eat a meal that wasn’t cooked by myself, because i don’t know the exact calories, and that usually leads to binges. 

i was doing really good this week (ate around 1400 calories per day while staying active), but this afternoon i ate almost 500 calories worth of these chocolate wafer things, and afterwards i was just staring at my toilet and trying to force myself to throw up. i’ve never thrown up purposely before or been bulimic, but i thought i’d give it a try just this once, and it didn’t fucking work. i just can’t get myself to throw up. i’ve tried triggering my gag reflex with my finger and toothbrush and drinking salt water. nothing worked. 

i was so fucking upset that i just ate even more shit. my total calorie count today is 2000. i’m so fucking angry and stressed and i just want a goddamn ice cream cone but i know it’ll make me feel even worse.

I (20F) has always been obsessed with food my whole life as well as diets, Exercise and my weight. I just don’t think this amount of obsession with food is normal. I’ve had dramatic weight gains and loss because of it and it’s effecting my life. I see other girls going about saying that they forget to eat all the time or they just go by their day eating a small snack and not caring about eating food as much. 
And then there’s me, I always think about what I’m going to eat or what food I want to eat everyday (part of the reason why I’m actually obsessed with cooking.)
I snack whenever I’m not hungry all the time and even when I’m full I always feel like I need to finish my meal.  
Food gives me satisfaction, it makes me feel a certain way of comfort emotionally. It gives me pleasure when I don’t get any from my daily life and it’s such a big part of my life that I feel like because it is, it’s a problem. 

I don’t want to think about food this much, I struggle with my weight for so long and been on multiple diets to control it. Currently I’m trying to fast which controls how much I eat and it helps a lot, but I’m not really loosing weight from it because I’m still eating high caloric foods.

My teeth hadn’t been used or exercised in about a month so using them to chew things might’ve been the most painful feeling ever. I felt as though my teeth were getting ripped out of my gums, root and all. A very intense sore feeling. 

I found it hard to finish the plates my mom would make for me but my mom just told me that my stomach had probably shrunken and I just need to keep eating snd it’ll grow and I’ll be back to normal or whatever. 

I don’t know when it began after getting food poisoning but I kind of stopped eating all together, but not on purpose. I just won’t have an appetite for that day or I’ll literally be too lazy to make something or pick something up. Shit, I was too lazy to even order food on the phone I always had in my hand. It was just easier to not eat. Other days I would totally be hungry and hop in the kitchen and start to get down. But as soon as I sit down with that plate of food I just made, all my appetite would disappear and I would give it away or throw it away. Other days I’ll be in the middle of eating something and a wave of a feeling I can’t quite describe would stop me in my tracks and I’ll just be like “ehhh idk why but I don’t wanna eat anymore” it’s not like I’m disgusted by it or tired of what I’m eating I just don’t want to be eating anymore. 

For me this is really messing with my mental and my physical being. I hate knowing how hungry I am and wanting to eat but never eating, even when the food will be right in front of me. I just can’t ever hold an appetite for longer than 5 minutes. So if I don’t eat when I’m completely hungry and have the appetite for it, I won’t eat for a couple of days. 

I got a boyfriend 3 years ago (still dating) and I thought one of the perks of having a boyfriend was the healthy relationship weight you pack on (which was perfect bc I was trying to gain weight already) but if anything I’m losing weight. I avoid telling my boyfriend when I don’t eat, especially when it turns into days, bc he always just yells at me about how much I need to eat and how he doesn’t wanna have to worry about it bc he’s got a lot of other things to worry about. 

Again, I don’t even know if I’m in the right place for this but I’d love to know if what I’m dealing with is serious, or if I’m just being dramatic and reading too deep into it.",,Barely eating,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,p8jhmh,1,[deleted],,/r/eating_disorders/comments/p8jhmh/barely_eating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p8jhmh/barely_eating/,1629513847,571,0,0,0,-1,1,"Food poisoning and subsequent difficulty eating, lack of appetite, laziness, and physical discomfort while eating",harmful,"Experiences physical discomfort while eating due to past food poisoning, Lack of appetite and difficulty finishing meals, Avoidance of food and not eating for days at a time, Negative impact on mental and physical well-being, including weight loss",Food poisoning and lack of appetite,harmful,"Experiences physical pain and discomfort when eating due to prolonged lack of food intake, Lack of appetite and motivation to eat leads to not eating for days at a time, Negative response from boyfriend when expressing struggle with eating, Mental and physical health being affected",Experiencing loss of appetite and difficulty eating after a severe case of food poisoning,harmful,"Struggles with finishing meals or even starting them, Feelings of laziness and not wanting to eat, Difficulty holding an appetite for longer than 5 minutes, Avoiding telling loved ones about not eating due to negative reactions"
701,eating_disorders,"Hey. 

So I am 21/F, at age 13 I had bulimia and from there it went on for about a 1 and 1/2. At the time I was suffering with severe depression without knowing and I had never seeked any medical help up until I was 20. 

I thought in the past I was strong enough to overcome anything and back then people used to look at depression as something you could just get over and so I had the same mentality with my ED, I did well to stop myself from continuing to live that life but it caught up with me in ways I hadn't expected. 

Getting and drunk or being hungover and being sick, felt good but I knew it was bad to like it and it didn't kick in for a long while that I was enjoying it because it was the feeling of what it was like when I was bulimic. 

I decided 5 years ago that in diet change I wanted to go vegan, it was for the right reasons and I wasn't expecting it but I lost weight like it was nothing. I had bones showing out of skin and I hadn't ever seen them before and I was ecstatic about it. In 3 months I had lost 4 stone. Time went on however and now more and more vegan things are coming out which has meant more and more that things that where vegan have eventually become unhealthy again.

I went on birth control, I was eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted and It caught up with me and I was piling on the pounds. Safe to say I am still in that rut where I am at a weight I no longer desire again. I'll be honest and say I am still binging. It gets worse and worse to the point Im not sure if I'm even vegan anymore. 

My mum makes all my meals and I'll sit there and wait till she goes on her late shift to then order myself some food, sometimes I get things with cheese on it. I cant tell you how many bags I have hiding in my room where it is all takeaways I'm trying to hide from my mum as I know she checks the bins to make sure I eat. 

My mum not that long ago found out that I had a past ED, she doesn't know I'm currently in a different one. I don't think she fully understands it and I don't think she understands the toll it has on someone especially with depression playing into it. My brain doesn't work in ways that she can understand.

Thats why the other day, to me it was a big deal but to her it was nothing. My mum put me on a diet. I was there on sunday laying in bed wondering why I was still so hungry, naturally I waited for her to go on shift and ordered myself so much food and binged. 

I then had a shift at work and my mum told me she had made my food for the day, ""this is your 500 day"" she said. We had previously discussed about doing the 5:2 diet which essentially is on 2 days of the week you eat only 500 calories in the day, the rest of the week you can eat whatever you want. However, even though I said I'd be down to try it again (failed in the past) I didn't know it was going to be right away. 

So when I was told that the day was my 500 day, i sarcastically (but also meant it) replied that it was nice of her to let me know I was starting my diet that day. Little did I know she then went on to tell me it wasn't my first day as she had put me on it on the sunday... hence why I was hungry and ordered food. 

It was weird because anyone else I've spoken to about think my mum was just trying to be kind. But i know in my head that they also just don't get it. My head was in loops when I found out. I already didn't like myself from binging on the sunday and then to find out that should have been my 500 day made me more disgusted with myself because although it shouldn't be what I think, the first thought that came to my head was that I should have been starving myself that day. 

Not sure this is the best diet for me to be going on right now. Don't know if anyone else has had something like this happened to them but let me know how everything got on. I'm not doing well in general and I really want to stop binging but the moment I do I feel like I'm starving myself and I get aggy.",,I've been put on a diet without knowing.,5,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,p726h0,1,KB_Levi,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/p726h0/ive_been_put_on_a_diet_without_knowing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/p726h0/ive_been_put_on_a_diet_without_knowing/,1629326809,823,0,0,0,-1,1,Being put on a restrictive diet by mother,harmful,"Feeling triggered and disgusted with oneself after being put on the diet, Feeling like they should be starving themselves instead of eating, Struggling with binging despite wanting to stop",Being put on a diet by their mum without warning,harmful,"Feeling triggered and disgusted with themselves after finding out, Struggling with binging and feeling like they are either starving themselves or overeating",Being put on a diet by her mother,harmful,"Feeling disgusted with herself for not knowing that she was on a diet, Feeling like she should be starving herself when she finds out about the diet, Struggling with binging and feeling agitated when not binging"

I'll eat a cheeseburger, have french fries, drink a milkshake, and a soda and feel absolutely no guilt. I don't feel ashamed eating what I like. Hell, I'll even eat pasta three times a week.

i couldn’t stop thinking about it. i’ve started my 5th month of recovery now and i’ve never missed my eating disorder more in my life. i literally cried into the warm flannel shirt i wore during my eating disorder. then came out and asked her who looked sicker she said my aunt as if it was the easiest thing she’s ever answered. i screamed in emotions pain. i asked again. she answered my aunt easily. i explained why it’s wrong and how people with eds want to feel sick before they recover. she said “you’re sick” then i asked again and she said “ur aunt what can i say everyone looks sick in their own way” idk what that means. i called a suicide hotline and when i told the girl she gasped. 

later, i explained how what she said hurt me. i also explained how the girl on the hotline gasped. all of the sudden she switched the story and said “you never asked who’s sicker you asked ‘when i asked you that night who looked sicker what did you answer” why would i even ask that. i feel like i’m going crazy. i screamed into my pillow for half an hour straight from emotional pain to the point my throat is sore. my jaw is hurting, my neck hurts and i have a pounding headache. i’ve never felt this much emotional pain in my life.

711,eating_disorders,"Hey guys. I’ve been struggling with ED for my entire life(no joking, I remember hating myself at 6!) . It got especially bad this winter when I found out about IF and got crazy starving myself to the point I couldn’t stand up without holding on to something. After 5 months of this I started to lose my hair viciously and was overall extremely tired of restricting and not letting myself to focus on other things so I decided to recover.

It wasn’t so easy to stop controlling and I would never stop counting calories, but at least the “clock” in my head had stopped (negative sides of IF). A month ago I just had enough of calculating calories every single day so I turned off the calculator as well.

I just eat whatever feels good every day, there are no restrictions except for eating what I want(so I don’t eat cucumbers anymore to fill my stomach). Believe me, this is the life everyone should have (I still can’t get rid of the thoughts about food though).

Today I was curious how many calories I eat intuitively so I tried to count it (I wasn’t counting it throughout the day, but summarized my meals at the end of the day). It’s such a wonder for me that I actually consume less calories that I used to when I was obsessed with controlling my diet. Now I don’t count any calorie that comes in my mouth, I just enjoy it.

I just want to cheer you up a bit and show that every single fear about food is in your head. You deserve a better life! People are not often worth trusting, but your body surely is! Just let it show you what it’s like to just live.

So I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, bulimia and ED my whole life. Some parts of me hate to be like this. Some parts of me kind of are too attached to it to let it go. Anyways. Recently I got helped with a holistic dietitian, we had a few appointments, she seemed extremely nice and good vibes, and I felt that she really got me. She told me that I could count on her and that she would be there with me on my weight loss journey. 

So after a few appointments there was one day I felt really sick and had a few episodes 🤢 on the day of our appointment. So I wrote her a message asking if instead of a regular face to face appointment, if she could use that booked time to read an email that I wrote opening up to her about my ED and telling my most deep secrets that not even my partner knows about, such as bulimia habits, how I hate myself, how depressed I am... 

I told her because I really needed help. I told her because I really did not wanted to give up on my self, I wrote to her that it was my last call for help. 

I felt comfortable (or naive) enough to after 4 appointments believe that we had a true connection. That she was kind to me because she really wanted to help me no matter what. 

Two days after this email she replied that she received my email and she was going to reply it soon. 

This was two weeks ago and Friday I decided to give another try, so I sent her a voice message asking her if she saw my email, that I understand that it was quite important to me, and if she do not would like to continue as my dietitian to let me know. I sent this last one crying. Apologising for being too much but thing were really hard for me. Still no reply. 

Even though I told her how bad I was, I desperate for help I was. 
I was calling for help. 
I thought I could ask for help. But no. 

The worst part is that I can’t stop to overthink it, check my phone to see if she replied, check my email, check her social media, I’m becoming a stalker or something, the fact that she rejected help really messed with my mind, I think I’m getting crazy sometimes. 

The truth is. Nobody gets it. People are as disgusted by it as us. Nobody is there to save us. I will never trust no one anymore. 😓",,SO SAD!

I've never struggled with ed, I'm 25 girl from Italy (so sorry for my bad English) I find this subreddit searching news about Eugenia C.
I started reading your post and I don't know what to say, but I would like to hug all of you, and say you're not alone! I will never understand what does it mean struggling with anorexia or bulimia. I had as it commons when we are a little bit younger problems with my body and my prospectives but I fix it easily. I suffer from depression and anxiety but now I can say I'm really happy of my life, thanks to my psychologist. 

Btw reading your post made me really sad. I would like to help all of you girls and boys who wants to change their life. I have lots of friends who are suffering from those illness and I can't understand how you can live like this. 
Btw I don't have any suggestion for you because I'm not a nutritionist or a psychologist, but don't think about what people said to you in the past. You're special, you're the only one and nobody can be like you, don't compare yourself to others, you are enough for you! I know that everyone of you is special! I always love people for their soul not their body, you're good enough already. Yeah maybe those words could seems stupid for you but I think that every human being should be grateful of who they are.

715,eating_disorders,"I wake up in the morning and I drink a plain black coffee. I’ve never had trouble with eating before but it seems like every time I would eat food I would get anxiety and need to vomit (it happens usually when I’m not home such as work or road trips). So I simply stopped eating diner throughout it the day and I would wait until I would get home (at 5:30) to eat anything. 

Do I have a fear of food? Or am I just mixing not eating with anxiety? 

Today, I didn’t eat anything because I knew I would go to a party and I didn’t want anxiety. Now, when I got home I’m drunk and I don’t have the energy to even eat. 

I think my brain gives my stomach signals to feel sick when I eat anything out of my home since as soon as I take a bite of food I instantly feel sick and need to go to the washroom. I’m tired of fearing my own stomach and I envy my friends who can literally eat whenever and whatever they want. 

One thing that I need to mention: I do love seeing those number on the scale go down when I barely eat on days I feel like my mind took over my stomach. 
So far I was at 154 pounds (on days when I ate food) and now I’m at 145 pounds (I weighed myself this morning).

I’m 5’4 and weigh 99 lbs, so my BMI is 17. 
According to my doctor, I’m underweight. But BMI doesn’t count for weight in the abdomen or in the face,now does it?...
Those are the two main areas I fixate on and shame myself for. 
I’m insecure about my body (leading me to eschew social situations) and am very restrictive with my diet. 
But when I revealed my weight to my parents they’re in shock and disbelief.
Meaning, as I’ve mentioned, it’s hard to believe I’m underweight when you look at me. 
I’m in a state of confusion abt how to act cause on one hand I look in the mirror and see nothing but fat, on the other my loved ones are starting to see my restrictive tendencies and are heavily concerned. They’ve told me in panicky voices that they should’ve “saw the signs earlier” and that I look like a Holocaust survivor but I think they’re over exaggerating.
Anyway, I eat small portions and exercise as much as possible. And I’ll continue to do so until I achieve a body I’m happy with. Even if I don’t want to...
I’ve come so accustomed to this ‘striving for unreachable perfection’ lifestyle that I won’t be able to get out of it any time soon. And it doesn’t help that my mom said I just naturally have a “big face on a skinny body”. 
Yeah, that makes me want to eat even less. She comments on the size of my thighs as well, saying that I’ve room to tone up. But to be fair, I chose to confide in her asking for an honest opinion on my features...So idk what to believe at this point.

721,eating_disorders,"so i struggled w an eating disorder from 14-17 that was really toxic for my mental health and sent me on a bit of a spiral. however, once i started smoking weed my relationship w food changed and i was able to stop worrying about calories and “healthy” eating (starving myself basically). I was around 120 pounds at this time and gradually gained weight again until i was overweight. my highest weight was 200 pounds.

so anyway, fast forward to now i’m 23 and haven’t starved myself for years. i smoked weed regularly and loves cooking and baking sooo much. also alcohol lol. but now i am dealing w health issues (GERD and LPR) that feel like they r reverting me back to my eating disorder days. i cry whenever i cook partially bc everything makes me feel like shit and also i don’t feel like i deserve to eat bc eating is kind of what put me in this situation in the first place? and ik logic to fight that idea but i just don’t believe it.

I am F28 &amp; 70kg/154lbs and 163cm/5.34’. 

I started to have an ED when I started my master degree after gaining weight from going out and eating a lot. I am now a bit overweight and really not happy with how I look like. 

To lose weight I tried everything, OMAD, water fasting, keto and it only makes it worse!

I feel now a bit depressed and want to recover. I am trying to eat normally (no more restrictive eating for my metabolism to get normal again) but I am bloating so much and my stomach hurts. With my stomach bloating, I feel even worse. I don’t want to go out or to meet friends again because I don’t feel confident. I have a hard time to concentrate at work as well. Now I cry so easily as well. I decided to take a personal trainer twice per week to lose weight in a healthy way and help with my stress.

I'm trying to incorporate more into my diet (old safe foods) and, above all else, believe that I am not some hideous waste of space. Yet I'm constantly anxious and have no appetite at all, and seem to feel guilty eating anything half the time. 

I was under CAHMS for EDNOS (kind of orthorexia?) about two years ago... unfortunately they didn't really help and I'd heard worse of adult services so decided to swerve them, giving my therapist the impression I'd carry on 'doing well'. This wasn't the case. Other factors: Covid, university, etc. have made maintaining a reasonable virtually impossible and from early 2021 I entered into a downward spiral of weight loss and misery. It's a bit grotty.

I feel stupid - I have enough wrong with me without an ED - and unable to move. I just don't know what to do with myself. I have a psychotherapist... but he doesn't really seem to understand how bad this all is and I just can't tell him because he seems to be the only friend I've got. My Mum, my biggest support, is trying to help me too... though I can't overrely on her. She was my biggest support and biggest help last time but everything just feels so impossible now. I look hideous, need to gain weight - yet feel disgusting and need some form of motivation to do so because I lack it in every capacity. I used to love cooking, baking and feeling well on a semi-vegan (occasional egg) diet - but now I find that I'm not all in it at all. I'm seemingly just getting worse: my face has swollen (no idea why) - eyes and relatively evenly below the corners of my mouth; I'm constantly needing to pee; mottled legs and always cold (rollnecks in summer, you name it). It's very bad and I hate to worry everyone so much - as much as I try to hide all this.

According to different websites, I'm either slightly underweight or at the edge of being so. But I want to lose more weight. I know it's bad but still. My face and my legs have always been pretty chubby which makes me feel awful. I weigh myself at least like 10 times a day and when there's less then what I expected it makes me happy but when there's more I beat myself up because of it (literally). I've been hating my body since I was 10 or so. I compare myself to others a lot. It's always been like that but I think it's getting worse lately. Eating makes me feel bad, I still eat because my parents force me to but I feel like I would just stop eating if they weren't there. I've also been struggling with worsening self harm since I was 13. I don't expect you to give me a diagnosis or something but I would appreciate it if you could help me a bit idk I'm really confused",,Idk if this is an eating disorder or if I'm slipping into one,12,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,oqmj81,1,_Nata_Eilatan,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/oqmj81/idk_if_this_is_an_eating_disorder_or_if_im/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oqmj81/idk_if_this_is_an_eating_disorder_or_if_im/,1627117817,205,0,0,1,-1,1,"Negative body image and desire to lose weight, compulsive weighing, negative emotions associated with eating",harmful,"The individual has been struggling with worsening self-harm since age 13, Feeling confused and seeking help","Negative body image, weight obsession, self-harm, dislike of eating",harmful,"Obsessively weighing oneself multiple times per day, Beating oneself up for gaining weight, Disliking one’s body since age 10, Comparing oneself to others, Feeling bad after eating, Struggling with self-harm since age 13","Negative body image, compulsive weighing, self-harm, negative feelings towards eating",harmful,"Frequent weighing and compulsive behavior reinforces negative body image and self-harm tendencies, Eating is associated with negative emotions and self-harm tendencies"

this whole thing started about 2-3 years ago when i became very self concious about my body. i started skipping meals, avoiding food and i even purged a few times. my self harm struggle was at a peak at the time so i went to a councilor and i told them about it which lead to me talking about the way i felt about food and my body. counseling didn't really help they barely even talked to me or acknowledge my relationship with food. when my counselling sessions finished i slowly started going back to self harming and also skipping meals. as of right now, im counting calories every day, weighing myself a lot more, avoiding food and skipping meals (i usually eat 800 cals to 1200 cals per day). i havent lost any significant weight and i dont think i look much thinner than i did before but this whole thing still affects my daily life so so much and im not even sure what to think about it. i cant currently visit a professional. however, acknowledging that this could potentially be a problem is so scary and i just dont wanna believe it overall but it's also hard for me to not know what to think of it. i also know that asking people on the internet and self diagnosing (which im not trying to do) is just not the way to go but its my only option as of right now",,is this an ed??,3,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,opyyyg,1,angeline_23,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/opyyyg/is_this_an_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/opyyyg/is_this_an_ed/,1627033081,252,0,0,1,-1,1,"Self-consciousness about body, skipping meals, purging, self-harm, counseling",harmful,"Counseling did not address the writer’s relationship with food and their eating disorder worsened after the sessions, Currently counting calories, weighing themselves, avoiding food, and skipping meals, Eating 800-1200 calories per day","Struggling with self-harm and body image issues, skipping meals, avoiding food, purging, counseling that did not address the relationship with food",harmful,"Continuing to struggle with counting calories, weighing oneself frequently, avoiding food, and skipping meals, Feeling scared and unsure about acknowledging this as a problem, Unable to visit a professional for help","Self-consciousness about body, skipping meals, purging, counseling",harmful,"Counseling did not help with relationship with food, Continued self-harm and disordered eating behaviors, including counting calories, weighing oneself frequently, avoiding food, and skipping meals"

I haven’t eaten anything and if I had to, it was thrown up after everyone left. I told my best friend at the beginning but I didn’t want to trigger her and cause anything for her to come back. Now, being hungry is okay for me. It hurts a little but the feeling is exciting for me. If I do eat, the feeling of food in my stomach hurts if I don’t throw up fast enough. Last night was the first night I ate actual food without tossing it up and I was miserable all night, even now. Since I’ve stopped eating, my hands and feet start tingling so much more than ever.

747,eating_disorders,"I’ve never been someone to really care about my health. If I was hungry I would eat. But it wasn’t until recently that someone pointed out to me that was not the truth. My mind must have made me think that was the truth. 

I eat when I’m bored…not when I’m hungry. I eat to fill the void that boredom creates. I don’t even think about it, it just seems like second nature to look for a sweet treat to eat… then I’ll have another, and another, and before I know it I’ve already had 3 or 4 sweet treats. 

When I really think about it, I don’t know what is okay and not okay when it comes to eating. I don’t know what “healthy etiquette” is. I just see food as something that can fill my stomach and end my boredom. I don’t see something unhealthy, I don’t see something healthy, I don’t see the right or wrong type of meal. I just see food.

I’ll still have dinner with my wife, but what she doesn’t know is the McDonald’s I had on my way home from work, or the 3 s’mores I had when she was at her parents house. I’ll hide the evidence and convince myself it didn’t happen. 

Now when I think about it I don’t even know how to eat healthy. I don’t know what the right or wrong think is to eat. I just want something quick and easy so my can feel satisfied, and that usually means something processed, or fast food.

748,eating_disorders,"Brain dump (so apologies if there is a lack of continuity): I am thin but normal. I used to be 8kg lighter. I recovered physically but the hilarious part is that I  barely changed my diet and exercise routine. I've always eaten a wholesome pescatrian diet that consist of breakfast, lunch and dinner with a small 'desert' after lunch and dinner. My portions are generous for every meal. I love sports, I'm athletic and exercise 4 times/week. From the outside, I look like someone who's got their life together; my own company, a stable relationship, a loving family and a good group of friends. However, I miss my old body so much that it makes me severely depressed and nothing in life makes me happy. I used to be the thinnest out of everyone I knew. Now, I have friends who lost weight and are thinner than me. I constantly look at my old pictures, compare myself to every single person around me and on Instagram. I don't understand how people can skip meals, fast, eat small portions, serve themselves only once, forget to eat, exercise every day etc. If I did that, the empty pit in my stomach would distract me and all I would do is think about my next meal. I would suffer. I can lose 2-3 hours a day taking pictures and videos and analysing every square inch of my body. My mind is poisoned. However, with an eating disorder plaguing my every thought, I still perform really well. But imagine my mind free of it. My potential is huge. But in all honesty, my body makes me so angry and depressed that nothing matters and all I want is to lose a bit of weight. Never go down to the level I was because I would destroy my company, my relationship and everything around me, but maybe 3-4kg. However, no matter how much I try, I cannot seem to change the way I eat or exercise. I can't stop eating that small desert after lunch or my 5 squares of dark choc after dinner. I can't just cut a little bit out of my meal, just a little. I can't do any of that. I can't up my exercise to 5 times instead of 4. For some reason, it feels like I'm on autopilot and can't change my lifestyle to lose that extra bit of weight. And that makes me even more obsessed and more depressed and ANGRY. That is my struggle.

for one, i’ve always been a picky eater and the entire time i was growing up she hated that. she would force me to eat foods i hated and i have vivid memories of her forcing me to eat mashed potatoes even tho the consistency and texture made me gag every time and she knew that. i would be sitting at the table crying about to throw up just so that she could make sure i ate my vegetables instead of her giving me literally anything else that wasn’t torture for me to eat. 

she would always say that it was my fault there wasn’t any food i liked around the house and that if i asked for stuff she would get it but whenever i asked for anything i was ignored. one time i asked for sliced apples and my father said it wasn’t a valid request so i didn’t get any. i have braces and can’t bite into apples but i don’t always have it in me to cut an apple up so i literally just wanted apple slices but i didn’t get those.

eventually my mom got tired of forcing me to eat food that i didn’t like so she just stopped giving me food at all. she continued making food for my brothers and just told me i was old enough to handle it myself. so then i was left having a horrible relationship with food because of my mother, and no one to make sure i was eating. 

eventually i found foods i liked and it turned into even more of a problem because then instead of just not eating much it turned into a cycle of me eating way too much that i felt sick and then me starving myself because of how terrible i felt. and throughout all of this my mother would make comments about my body.

i felt so insecure because of her that i would wear clothes that covered literally everything. when i finally got my eating under control and was comfortable with my body, i started dressing like normal teenagers do and that was clearly unacceptable because according to my mom wearing a tank top in 90 degree weather isn’t allowed.

i had also gone to my doctor at one point and she was concerned that i was underweight and told me to go see her again after three months so of course after we left the appointment my mom got mad at me for not eating. when we went back three months later the doctor was happy that i hadn’t lost anymore weight (because i put in the effort to try and get better) and my mom told her that i don’t actually have a problem i’m just a picky eater and find it fun to be difficult about meals.

so anyway i refuse to reread that so hopefully it makes sense but yeah i’m fairly certain if it weren’t for my mom i would be able to actually eat normally and typing all that made me feel a lot better. i always feel bad talking to my friends about this stuff because the people that don’t get it just make me feel so much worse but i don’t want to hurt the people that do get it by reminding them of how hard it can be.",,i blame my mother for most of my problems,15,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,offlme,1,arson-is-hot,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/offlme/i_blame_my_mother_for_most_of_my_problems/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/offlme/i_blame_my_mother_for_most_of_my_problems/,1625650736,583,0,0,0,-1,1,"Forced to eat foods she hated, ignored when requesting foods she liked, mother made negative comments about her body",harmful,"Developed a difficult relationship with food, leading to cycles of overeating and starving, Feeling insecure about her body and covering up with clothing, Mother denied the existence of her eating disorder and claimed she was just a picky eater","Negative comments and forceful feeding from mother, lack of support and attention from family",harmful,"Developed a picky eating habit and a negative relationship with food, Cycle of binge eating and starving, Insecurity and negative body image, Feeling unsupported and invalidated by family, Mother dismissed and denied daughter’s eating disorder","Negative and abusive behavior from the mother, including forcing the writer to eat foods they hated, withholding food, making comments about their body, and dismissing their eating disorder as being a picky eater",harmful,"Developed an unhealthy relationship with food, including bingeing and restriction, Feeling insecure and covering up their body due to comments from their mother, Feeling unsupported by friends who don't understand their struggles"
758,eating_disorders,"Hi !! It’s been now 3 years i’m struggling with food and with my weight. At first I wanted to diet and do some exercices but it quickly became an obsession, and so a nightmare. I was very sad every day, eating nothing, trying to purge sometimes, having dark thoughts,.. So I searched on internet and found that it might be an eating disorder seeing the symptoms and my situation. I saw that it could be relied to family problems, having a daddy issue and a depressed mother, I think they influenced. 
I have not told my mom until.. last year ? Even if she had doubt about me feeling down for months. 
When I decided to change because I hated being like this, I tried to tell her, mentioning the “eating disorder” exists, she denied. 
Today after 3 years, I thought I was better, but I’m not and I can’t talk to my mom, for her I’m just not secure about myself and I read too much on internet. Anorexia ? Impossible for her. She doesn’t want me to see a therapist for nothing.

761,eating_disorders,"I’ll start with some context. I joined Color Guard my sophomore year (I will be a senior this fall) of high school and had a full, regular season until the end of Winter Guard when the pandemic began. We had a “season” in the fall of 2020 with no competitions and an exhibition performance, however I was diagnosed with Anorexia near the end of the season and had to quit as it was no longer safe for me to continue. After quitting and not having to do a season of Winter Guard, I felt a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. For one I was too weak to do very well at all, which made me embarrassed and quite stressed. I also realized how big of a commitment Color Guard was, not only time wise but emotionally, mentally and physically it consumed me. However, I also felt a sense of guilt not having finished out the season and returning for Winter Guard. I missed the activities my guard traditionally does together, the performing, competition days, and just the activity in general. So when this year rolled around and my recovery only got better and better, I told myself that this season would be my opportunity to push myself and have the best season yet with my newfound confidence and awareness of my health. I have improved a lot and am not as worried about performing poorly like I was my sophomore year. However, my school is a big school with a band that consistently competes at the state and national level. Because of this, we are highly competitive, and have intense and lengthy rehearsals. Lately I have felt myself slipping and I have restricted more than I thought I was. I exercise on a regular basis and I can feel myself losing my stamina, and I did weigh myself this morning and I have lost a substantial amount of weight in a short time. I know this isn’t sustainable for Color Guard, and if I continue down this road it will end my season like last year. Part of me is really afraid to do Guard because I worry it will send me backwards and I will have to quit again. I do have a rigorous schedule too, and additional stress at school is a trigger for me. I really do love Guard and letting go is really hard for me to think about, but a part of me doesn’t believe I can stop restricting and that Guard will make it even worse.",,Should I Stay in My Sport?,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,oe930l,1,complexbanana_303,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/oe930l/should_i_stay_in_my_sport/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/oe930l/should_i_stay_in_my_sport/,1625497069,424,0,0,0,-1,1,"Participating in Color Guard, Highly competitive environment with intense and lengthy rehearsals, Additional stress at school",harmful,"Experiencing slipping in recovery and increased restriction, Losing stamina and weight rapidly, Fearful of participating in Guard and triggering a relapse","Participating in Color Guard, intense and lengthy rehearsals, rigorous schedule, additional stress at school",harmful,"Feeling guilty about quitting Color Guard due to anorexia diagnosis, Feeling conflicted about participating in Color Guard due to fear of relapse and concerns about physical and emotional demands, Restricting food intake and losing weight, Experiencing decreased stamina and fear of not being able to perform well","Participation in Color Guard, highly competitive environment, rigorous schedule, additional stress at school",harmful,"Prior diagnosis of anorexia, Feeling guilty about quitting the previous season due to anorexia, Experiencing slipping and increased restriction in current season, resulting in weight loss and loss of stamina, Fear that continuing with Color Guard will exacerbate the eating disorder and potentially lead to quitting again"

763,eating_disorders,"I see a therapist because I struggle with anxiety and disordered eating habits. Things have been getting worse over the past month and I don't know how to tell my therapist. I've never been formally diagnosed with an ED but things have escalated to the point that I think I may have a full blown eating disorder. My therapist knows I struggle with really low self-esteem, obsessively counting calories, and restricting what I eat, which has caused me to lose an unhealthy amount of weight. She has expressed to me that if things don't get better that she may break confidentiality and tell my parents (I'm 18 and will be moving away for college in August) because I guess obsessively restricting caloric intake falls into the category of self harm. What she doesn't know is that over this past month I've also been struggling with binging and purging which has been really taking a toll on me mentally. 

She always tells me I look healthy when I express how I never feel like I'm thin enough even though I've gone from a healthy weight to underweight over the past few months. It's really triggering for me because I convince myself she doesn't think I'm thin enough to deserve help.

I would go three days without any food at all and the thought of eating food scared me that I'd just put weight back on again. When I did eat, I'd manage about 500-600 calories a day. Just, it started getting really bad. 

Luckily I have so many people who are supportive and we managed to catch it really quick. I'm still working on it and still struggling. At one point I was eating two meals and a snack but that's slid back to one meal and possibly a snack. But due to all of this and the amount of weight I've lost, I need new clothes. I'm not underweight yet and trying not to get there, but my clothing is almost falling off me. 

I'm terrified to go and get new clothes, however. The fact my current ones are falling off shows me the weight I lost and makes me feel decent about everything for the most part. I have no idea what size I might be in now, and I'm worried that if I try on a pair of jeans to realise they are too small it might trigger a relapse. 

I'm trying really hard to get my eating back to a good place. Luckily my boyfriend has managed to convince me that he loves my body, so that helps. And he's helping me try to remember to eat. He's just amazingly supportive, but I'm still so scared to go and do this even though I know I'm going to have to.

775,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone,

So recently I’ve found out that my partner is recovering from an eating disorder. Sometimes he eats but sometimes he struggles to. Recently though, he’s been really trying and I’m so so proud of him! 
I really want to help him as much as I can but fear that I’m not helping enough or that I’m not doing the right things as I have no experience. 

One thing he finds nice is when I ask if he’s eaten today; to which he usually replies “yes but only something small”. 
I feel incredibly proud of him and the progress he’s made and I’m wondering what are some supportive things I can say or do when they tell me they’ve eaten? 

I tell him “I’m so proud of you” and then tell him he’s doing amazingly but I don’t want to just keep saying the same things, yknow? 
Again, I’m overthinking. 

If anyone has any advice that would be great! Thank you :)

776,eating_disorders,"I think my boyfriend has an eating disorder, not anorexia, but the way he eats isn’t really similar to what normal eating behavior looks like

He has a very large underweight, he is constantly feeling bad because of it, sometimes he can't get out of bed, freezes, feels himself very weak

He is very worried about his appearance, considers himself ugly, doesn’t wear anything but baggy  sportswear, can’t go out in a t-shirt, only in a hoodie. Can't go to the pool/beach/gym. He hates eating in front of someone else, also he is afraid to weigh himself

He considers himself too thin, tries to gain weight, work out (if girls usually lose weight, guys most likely try to gain weight and work out, I think?), but he says that he simply can't eat, even when he is hungry, and that every bite is accompanied by pain. He eats only a limited set of foods that don’t make him disgusted and that he can always eat

He has a constant stomach ache from hunger, and he says that he likes this feeling, and he intentionally doesn’t eat to feel the pain. He also sometimes says that he wants to lose even more weight, because then he  will hate himself even more and this is something like a punishment. At the same time, he is very worried about his appearance and has been trying to gain weight for several years

Every time we raise the topic of weight or nutrition, he cries, it’s very painful for him. I want to help him somehow, but I have no idea how.

779,eating_disorders,"i'm pretty sure my mom was and is the largest contributor to my eating disorder/body dysmorphia.

growing up, she would always put herself down if she thought she looked ""fat"" or ""ugly"" which was ALL the fucking time. i was bigger than her so i internalised everything she said and applied it to myself. i was always a chubby kid and i never had the energy to do anything about it so the fat shaming and name calling and self hatred followed me throughout high school. until about a year ago, when lockdown hit, and i think i developed an eating disorder.

it started off as me just skipping dinners because i genuinely wasn't hungry, then gradually turned into ""intermittent fasting"" and ultimately, me starving myself and becoming obsessive about my body &amp; appearance and having a mental breakdown over milk in my coffee. 

in the first month or two of this, i lost a lot of weight and i kept it off. people were nicer to me and complimented me and i felt good about myself for a while. then my mom obviously took it upon herself to follow in my footsteps and took it to the stratosphere. counting calories, virtually banning ""unhealthy"" food, mass-ordering gum - you name it, she did it. and naturally projected it onto me and my dad. 

every fucking time i eat anything or she eats anything or my dad eats anything she HAS to comment on it. it's either ""how many calories was that?"" or ""i wonder how many sit ups would burn this meal"" or berating me for not ""eating clean"" because i had a single fucking square of chocolate in the middle of the day. she always says it in a nice tone so she gets away with it, but im sick of pretending it isn't manipulative and clearly backhanded. she claims that she just does it because she cares about our health and not the way her/my body looks but after every meal she has, she holds her stomach and verbally examines how ""fat"" she looks that day.

diet culture is all anyone talks about here and i can't deal with it anymore. i can feel myself getting worse and sicker each day. yesterday we went out to eat for the first time in months and i didn't hold back because i restricted all week, but every time i asked to order anything she had something to say about it. 

i feel bad for her because obviously i know what it's like to feel shitty about the way you look and the way your body looks, but i don't think she realises that i'm still just an impressionable kid and i'm not supposed to be treated like i'm more mature than a teenager's supposed to be. 

i've had to take care of her my entire life and she's been trauma dumping on me since i was a kid but now i've reached the brink of how much abuse i can take from her standing up. i just need a break. i'm on the verge of reaching my breaking point and i don't know what to do about it. i can't leave my house because of lockdown so i'm just stuck in this cycle until i inevitably go to college in a year. 

she's manipulative and twists words around to make me at fault every time i try to confront her about anything so i don't think talking to her would help.

780,eating_disorders,"To start off, I don't really know if I even have an ED, even though my behaviors are similar. It started when I was around 11, more of an social anxiety thing at the time. I would avoid ordering food at restaurants because the words would feel like they get stuck in my throat and I couldn't order, so I would just not eat anything, or at the very least order a salad. 

It was like that for a few years, until I was 13, I had a few friends who were obsessed with skincare, and would get angry If I accidentally touched their face because they didn't want to get acne because of me. They would frequently talk during lunch about how they weren't going to eat certain things to avoid getting bad skin. My skin was not terrible, but being a young and impressionable teenager, I naturally became extremely self conscious. This is where it really got bad. I would spend time reading and analyzing every ingredient to make sure it wouldn't make my skin bad. I would spend hours online researching diets to make me healthier for better skin. This just spiraled into diets for weight and longevity, which no 13 year old should have to worry about. 

I wouldn't eat sugar, of almost any kind, no dairy, no processed foods, no foods that seemed overly fried or oily. And if no food in my specific ""diet"" were available, then I just wouldn't eat anything.  My school lunches became dreadful, and my biggest ""enemy"" was sugar. At the time I was also fucking up my skin with my mass amounts of products I was using, but that's not really relevant.  I also started to develop a paranoid idea that any food that I didn't make was poisoned. I remember at my sister's 21st birthday vacation, I wanted to seem grateful and eat the cake there, but I never really got to enjoy that day, because I was in the bathroom emptying my stomach to get rid of the cake. 

When I went to highschool, if my family hadn't gone to the store in a while and none of my ""safe"" lunch foods were not at home, I just wouldn't eat lunch. My friends knew I wouldn't eat at times but they just thought I was picky, but I wanted to eat what they ate, I just never allowed myself to. I was so unhappy at the time. 

It wasn't until the past couple of years that things got a little better. A little. I started online school (not bc of the virus, I started online on my own choice in 2019) and was able to eat at my own times, and became a little less paranoid, maybe because I stopped hanging out with friends that made me feel bad, maybe because certain ""healthy"" foods are typically more expensive, or maybe because of a less anxiety inducing environment. 

But its still very difficult. I still have things I won't eat, but its more of preferences rather than feeling like the foods are unsafe. No one around me seems to understand though. My brother mocks me when he sees me eat something I typically wouldn't, but I'm used to his comments and usually brush it off. It is mainly my sister or mother, when I eat a burger or something, they loudly exclaim and question me or raise an eyebrow. I don't know why but it makes me extremely paranoid and awful, I feel like I am 13 again, crying at night because I was too hungry to fall asleep. When they say these things I usually but the food back when their backs are turned or just decide not to eat. 

Now I WANT to eat, but I just can't bring myself to do it properly. I get very hungry, but the act of actually eating something just seems tiring so I skip out.

783,eating_disorders," I feel so stupid posting this long pointless story, but I feel like I can't tell anyone else. I haven't even approached it with my husband yet, but I know that's coming. I just need to share my thoughts and see if anyone can relate to my particular situation.

I've been pretty privately struggling with disordered eating habits for a while. In the past few years, I lost a lot of weight through healthy means. I still felt I wasn't thin enough, and I restricted probably a bit too much on most days, but I was more or less in maintenance mode with some weeks that would include more weight loss. But generally, I stopped checking the scale and was mostly focused on healthy living. For a good, long time. 

Then, a few months ago, I was prescribed medication that impacted my appetite. I would have to set reminders to eat because I don't get hungry as often as I used to. This was fine for a while. Then, as an additional factor, my schedule at work picked up to the point where I have barely any breaks in my day. I work 6 days a week at crazy hours, and unfortunately my job isn't a job that I am able to eat during, unless I am in between clients. 

So, I started reminding myself to eat between clients, and this was...okay-ish. The problem is I got into the habit of saying, ""You're not that hungry right now. Why don't you hold off until the next break?"" Then, I would get busy, and I would be distracted when I DID start to feel hunger, and I would push through that feeling because I figured...eating less is better.

I honestly don't know why this happened--where ""less"" became ""right.”  But I gradually slipped into these patterns of behavior that reflect the idea that the less I'm eating, the better. The confusing part of this is: I DO NOT THINK I'M FAT. I LIKE THE WAY I LOOK. I DO NOT FEEL I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT. And I want to make that clear. Everyone is constantly telling me I've lost weight. Sometimes they say it as a compliment and ask how I'm doing it. Sometimes they express concern about whether I'm eating enough.

At this point, I think I've basically become addicted to the number dropping. When I eat fewer calories, I feel powerful. When I lose more pounds, I feel a sick sense of satisfaction. And I literally do not understand why because I like the way I look. So, now I'm in the underweight category, (if you believe in the BMI) which has literally never happened before to my knowledge, and I am \*still\* continuing in restriction mode. I know this can't be going anywhere good, and yet I'm not stopping it. I feel like such a gross person admitting this. I know my husband would be heartbroken if he heard these words.

I feel selfish for not telling him.

Today, my dad barley eats anything. He’ll eat half a tuna sandwich and say he’s full and will only drink water for the rest of the day. 

He’s underweight and already going to the hospital for pains in his kidneys but he won’t admit it’s because of his eating. He’s using his age as an excuse. 

My dad has a horrible relationship with food.

787,eating_disorders,"Hey guys, im not sure what to really do, or what to call what ive been experiencing, but im just looking to get advice and see if anyone out there shares a similar experience bc i just kind of feel alone in it.

Ive been diagnosed with adhd since i was 11 and have been on different doses of concerta ever since. its always effected my appetite, but not enough to really matter until the past few years or so. Ive always been a skinny kid and hated that, im trans and its a large part of my dysphoria. 

I started my freshman year of college last year and thats when i really noticed appetite being messed up. I find it really hard to make myself eat, social anxiety prevents me from going out to get food (especially alone). If i eat i cant eat much because i get full quickly, but then im hungry a few hours later and have to force myself to eat again. i also hate eating at random times, or if its late at night, i often go to bed hungry because i dont want to eat something before i got to sleep. im not sure its because im tired or cant because my meds wore off, or if its because i always hear that its bad for you to eat before bed.

my sense of taste has also been messed up by covid. i had an asymptomatic case that im still not sure when i had it, but lost
my sense of smell, but kept my taste. now, my smell is slowly coming back, but it had ruined my sense of taste. food just doesnt taste good anymore. 

i dont want to say i have an ed because several close people ive had throughout my life have had eds and i dont want to self diagnose, plus i dont do it because i want to be thinner or anything like that, if anything, i want to eat more but i cant.

im looking for advice from anyone who struggles to eat due to medication, or if anyone had the same thing with taste happen to them and if theres ways that i can help it?

799,eating_disorders,"*I don't want to trigger anyone, so just putting a warning at the top that I'll be talking about food &amp; my body*

Ok, so I am very skinny &amp; very tall....I've done modeling in the past. I've never starved myself in my life, but I do in fact have a small appetite. I've had a friend for the past 4 years who always talks about how she has bullimia. She never seems to get any help though. She in turn takes it out on me &amp; nobody else. She tells me I look anorexic in public &amp; says it's a compliment, asks how much I starve myself between meals, and gets mad at me if I don't finish my meals. Like really mad, and tries to convince me that I'm the one with the ED. If I say anything she blames her ED.

As an example:
I was joking with another friend about how ""I wish I was pregnant, so I could eat more"" because we were having like a friendsgiving. And then the friend I'm talking about turns out to be right behind me and says ""Oh my god, you're trying to make fun of me...you're shaming my body!"" And I was like ""no, I didn't even know you were behind me"" which I didn't. And in the end everyone blames me because she's the one with the ED.

2nd Example:
We're eating korean food, and it's really spicy. She gets mad at me and says I'm starving myself because I couldn't swallow all the soup fast enough. I was so infuriated that I took the whole bowl and chugged it and felt sick the whole night.

I purposefully hide in the bathrooms at lunch so I don't have to sit there while she tries to feed me &amp; tell me off about how I don't eat anything. I always feel insecure eating in front of people now and I feel as though I have to explain myself when I don't finish my food.

800,eating_disorders,I grew up in a cult with a very violent mother and mentally ill family. I was always scared of everything and developed an ed at 16. After yrs of binging and exercise addiction and drowning in hell at 25 I finally went to treatment. I went twice. It took that and years later to finally be able to eat things like bread. To not have to compensate for eating with exercise. To accept myself at a healthy natural weight. Fastforward to my mental breakdown this yr. Diagnosed with bpd panic disorder ocd depression and severe ptsd. I kept trying to switch my meds to get them to help with the panic and every change I made threw on the pounds. I finally weened myself off effexor and immediately gained15 pounds. The constant fluctuation and ups and downs sent me into a severe relapse. I hadn't owned a scale in years and now I weigh myself constantly. All I think about is weightloss and food. I desperately need to be on medication but am TERRIFIED of the weight gain bc of the loss of control I felt over my body over the past few years. I am currently on just 20mg of cymbalta and am going to yet again ask my psych to take me off it and try another one bc I am scared of weightgain on this medicine. My ocd has me obsessively looking at drug reviews ALL DAY. It's literally all I do now. I don't work.  I don't do anything. I have no life anymore. My mental illness has taken over my life and everytime I try to take care of one part of it another part flares up. I desperately need to be medicated in order to get better but  my ocd and eating disorder has made drugs a nightmare for me .  Has anyone ever been stuck in a dead-end cycle like this?

802,eating_disorders,"I have had at least one ED since 2018, and while I was doing really good for a while, lately I can feel myself slipping back into those habits. 

Last month, my family moved across the US, and I had to go with(unwillingly). I had to leave all of my friends, not that I had many to start with. I also had to leave the one thing that was helping me eat regularly, weed. I moved from a state where I had my medical marijuana card to a state where it was completely illegal. But that’s not the point. 

I was fortunate enough to have been able to start three relationships with people I care deeply for, but two of them are back home.

The stress from this move and not having a house yet(even though we’ve been here for a month already) have been making whatever fucking disorders I have act up. Like, EVERYTHING. I’ve been more depressed, anxious, suicidal, I’ve self-harmed more often, and my relationship with food has gone down the drain. I’m trying to stay strong for my partners, but it’s getting hard to do that. 

When I have thought about food, it makes me sick to my stomach. I’ll binge eat, and then feel guilty and purge, but then I’ll feel guilty about wasting all that food so I’ll self harm and start a timer to track how long I go without food.

804,eating_disorders,"Hi, I’ve never posted here but I feel like I need to talk about this and I’m gonna rant. 
I used to struggle with hardcore anorexia and later binge/ starve habits. I recovered pretty well when I was 16, but I also stopped taking anti depressants around that time and my body has continuously changed over the last two and a half years. I was doing so well, I was comfortable with myself and wore whatever I wanted and ate and found a passion for cooking. 
Recently I put a lot of weight on though, and I can’t look at myself in the mirror without wanting to cry. Some days I wake up and I think I look fine, but as soon as I eat just a bite of something or even take a sip of water I feel like the shape of my body has changed entirely. I feel like I’m pouring out of my clothing and like I’m taking up so much space. I’ve gotten into a habit of not eating breakfast or lunch, so that by the time I go to work or go out with friends or anything I still look good in my clothes, but usually I’ll still eat dinner. I’ve started a habit of dinner out of a specific small bowl to limit my portion, and thinking about eating out of any other bowl makes me incredibly nervous. 
6 days a week I work from around 3-9, and I’ve started a habit of not making dinner and using the time I get out as my reason. 
After a few days of this habit, which gets worse on the weekends when I know I’m gonna go out, I start to think I look good and will eat a normal portion or eat lunch before work and then it starts over again. 
It’s also a struggle because my boyfriend and I love in the same house, and spend every day together. He’s very skinny naturally and fit, and eats a lot of junk food. He likes to bring home snacks and go out for ice cream and things like that and he gets sad and worried when I don’t want to have any and it makes me steel bad about myself. And I have intimate moments with my partner that I ruin because I start feeling like I look gigantic and saggy and repulsive and I need to hide myself right away and he gets confused by my sudden mood changes. 
I also struggle with substance problems, and this is not helpful with everything. When I’m going out, I’m usually drinking a LOT and doing a lot of drugs. But I avoid eating for a day or two before I go out to look okay, and it has resulted in shit lately. An overdose, embarrassment, blacking out. I’m just sad because I want to look good, but I feel like even though I hardly eat even everyday recently I look larger every day. AND I have a limited diet! Im vegan and am a very poor independent 19 y/o and hardly afford groceries lol. 
I don’t think my ED is really back cause some nights I eat a good dinner and some days I eat chips or gross snacks like that but these feelings have been controlling my life. I just can’t force myself to eat when I look the way I do.

807,eating_disorders,"So I’m a 17-year-old male, 5’6, 105lbs(usually) heading into my senior year of high school. I just got out of my first relationship ever and it’s kind of left me heartbroken. The issue is with the heartbreak my body’s number one response is to either cry and have anxiety attacks or what happens most of the time is I have this feeling that makes me sick to my stomach. I get this anxious feeling and my stomach is just doing flips. I’ll maybe eat one meal a day and even then I don’t really finish it. This is really upsetting to me because before the relationship and when I was in the relationship I was finally getting myself to eat a whole three meals a day while also snaking at night too. I was also actually intaking enough calories that my weight was kind of going up by like a pound or two, which I haven’t ever really been able to do in my life when I was trying to. 
I don’t know if this is an ED or if it’s more of just anxiety causing it. It could also just be all in my head and I’m just over exaggerating.

808,eating_disorders,"How do I know whether or not I have an eating disorder or need to recover? My weird eating habits started in, 2016 when I was 16. I remember coming across a video about the vegan diet and all of it's health benefits. Because of this I became motivated to try it.

I went into the diet blindly and didn't know anything about protein, carbs, fat, or even calories. I remember eating scraps...junk food. Cakes, chips, and candy...never ate anything nutritious. As long as I didn't consume meat, I thought I was practicing healthy eating.

I ate like this for 2 years...probably eating no more than 1200-1500 calories per day. Was definitely very famished and starved. And some times even fasted for multiple days. I was 6'0 160 pounds...I never lost a significant amount of weight. Only like 5-10 pounds, but I was also smaller and way weaker than my peers. I looked extremely ill. 

From 2016-2018, I had a ton of weird health issues come up. Lack of concentration, apathy, eye floaters, insomnia, hypothyroidism, and I can go on and on. I added meat back into my diet thinking that would improve my health. As if not eating meat was the cause of all my health issues. I didn't get any better. In fact, as time went on, I kept getting worse. I started losing hair, tinnitus out of no where, skin became gray, dry and dull. And more...

Things just kept getting worse. Fast forward 2020, I decided to eat 4000 calories/day. I had come across the Minnesota Starvation Experiment in December of 2019 and I remember starting a day after, Kobe passed on January 27th. My first go at it only lasted 3 days. I wouldn't try again until late april. Were pretty heavy in the pandemic during this time and my brother and sisters school would come by in a bus to our apartment complex and drop off cafeteria food. I would eat that and whatever we had at the house as long as it equated to 4000 calories at the end of the day.

This round of recovery lasted from late April to the end of May....and when I tell you I was extremely exhausted every day, I mean it...I also gained a bunch of weight. I went from like 165 to 190lbs. From May to sometime in 2021, I would eat 3000-4000 calories on and off...never consistently. Like I would eat 3500 calories on day and then for 2 weeks eat 1500. From January 2020 to sometime in 2021, I know it may sound crazy, but I went from 160 to 290 pounds.

This is very confusing to me, because even after gaining all this weight, all the health issues I had when I started restricting in 2016 to 2018 are still present...I literally only gained weight. My hair still falls out, my skin still looks 30 years aged...now I'm just overweight and and still very ill and dead inside

I think it started early spring 2019. End of 7th grade. Throughout 5-6 grade I was kinda chubby. Overall not bad. 7th grade was no exception. For some reason when I grew past Mom it really hit and stung. I grew out of all my pants and was complaining about not having pants to wear so mom took me to the store. I had to get 8s. Standing in the dressing room I grabbed my belly and showed mom my muffin top. She said ""man we really need to get you exercising."" That's when it hit me, This is the solution to my problem! I didn't say anything for a few days though. When I finally did, it was in several tearful confessions, in the car where she couldn't escape. Eventually we got me started exercising in the morning and tracking calories. I might be remembering wrong though because I have clear memories of morning exercising in 6th grade. Anyways, I weighed in the realm of 145 pounds. I was too ashamed and told mom 140. That's what we put in MyFitnessPal, after confirming I was over 18. That should have been the first red flag. I started to restrict calories and when I saw results, I starting restricting even more. By July or August of 2019, I was 135 pounds. I was pretty proud but at this point the loss plateaued. Putting me less than halfway towards my goal of 120 (red flag number two). It's also important to note that I was consistently eating only 800 calories per day (red flag 3). One can imagine why I was frustrated. Even if you didn't notice the first red flag, certainly you'd see this one. 800 calories per day isn't enough for a growing 13 year old. I also did a couple hardcore juice cleanses. My sister was recommended a liquid diet until her poop was clear (for medical reasons). I decided to do that too because why not. I got to the point where my poop was 100% liquid. My stomach hurt so bad and even just looking at gatorade made me sick. Body checking became a regular habit. I knew my BMI as well as what it would be if I was an inch shorter/taller or a pound less/more. Mom was fully aware of all this stuff and even still I was routinely congratulated on my ""self discipline"" by both her and dad. In August? was when dad and I went on a cruise. I went from 135 to 138 during that week. On the cruise I met a girl who was certainly shorter than me but she only weighed 116. I remember because we had to get weighed to go on the two person water slides. She also couldn't go on the tall water slide or else she'd get stuck, she was so small. A couple different times she complained that ""every time she looks she weighs less!"" I was kind of annoyed and more than a little jealous. After getting home my weight stayed at 134-140. I was fully on a new at this point and even just eating a tortilla made me sick. I maintained a steady 140ish until January 2020 when we went to Disneyland. I decided to go off the diet for the trip but then go back on once it was over. It'd be hard to do that in California anyways. So I go and eat whatever I want. After getting home, I couldn't go back on the diet - my food cravings were too intense. So I didn't. And so my weight suddenly jumped to 150 where it chilled awhile. Flash to quarantine (Marchish 2020). I have nothing to do all day except eat, so my weight climbed to 161. That was the stopping point for me. I looked in the mirror and hated what I saw. I looked up all sorts of crap online during this depressive state - how to lose weight quick, keto, juice cleanses, etc. I knew everything. I wanted to slim down again and I knew what helped last time. I figured I might as well bring that back. So I did. I managed to get to 150. I wasn't as religious with it however and soon totally abandoned it. That was fall 2020. It's always difficult to do this kind of thing during school. The social pressures and not to mention laziness make it almost not worth it. Somehow surprisingly, I maintained 150. It's now March and I'm tired of this. I hate riding on the border between regular and overweight. Lately I've been really bad at impulse control. I eat enough for a small kingdom. And I think if I continue this way I will start uncontrollably gaining weight again. I used to tell myself, yeah, I'm 5'7"", 150 is normal! But I measured myself against the wall and it turns out that 5'5"" is being generous. And yes, 150 is overweight for 5'5"". I bought new jeans today and while trying them on, I found that a pair of 9s was too small! Disgusting. I am disgusted with myself. This week has been really hard on my mental health and body image. Fickle friends and social failures. I really don't want it to turn back to anorexia's 800 calories but that's what worked last time? I asked mom to buy some diet friendly foods and I started tracking stuff on MyFitnessPal again.

I went to the dentist and she told me to stop drinking soda because the acidity destroyed my teeth. Although I have a sweet tooth, I don’t consume sugary foods. My parents raised with healthy food and I like it. 


My biggest problem now is that even though I’m taking pills for my stomach to flatten it out, it still destroys my body image. Additionally, I’m put on this non acidic diet that triggers me even more. My parents don’t know about this.

So title says it all really - I have a close friend who means a lot to me and I dont want to lose her as a friend and I want to support her with her ED. She has said she has an ED, but refuses to get help from the doctors. I understand it will take time so want to stand by her side throughout, however now we have started seeing each other again post-lockdown Ive realised how much more I monitor my food and feel dissatisfied with my own appearance after seeing her. 

I struggled with my eating in the past (from about the age of 13 along with unhealthy alcohol habits) but never got professional treatment I just got better after meeting my bf. I was at my slimmest when I met my boyfriend over 2 years ago. I have put some weight on since, but have a healthy BMI, and am much better with my food (I actually enjoy eating now!) but since seeing her I want to loose so much weight and get a slimmer waist etc. And it is definitely only after seeing her - Usually i run 3 times a week and am happy with my health and weight.

Im not sure what the best thing to do is. Im also not sure, upon reflection if I might also be fuelling her ED if this is how I feel about myself? I try hard to be supportive at the time but all she talks about is her weight and other peoples weights - I will change the topic and she’ll bring it back round.

824,eating_disorders,"Hi, I'm a first time poster here but I've read your off and on for a long time. I've struggled with anorexia/EDNOS for about 10 years, I'm 22 now. I've recovered once and over the past year or two have just fallen back into it. I've had lots of life changes in the meantime and am going through another big one now. 

As you know EDs come with a bunch of other mental health issues one of which is isolating yourself and alienating the people around you. Even when you feel fine and ""happy"" you lash out and just act like a bitch and only realize what you're doing a little bit later, with or without feeling guilty about it.

825,eating_disorders,"We are both 14 and she's been trying not to eat since she was 11. some random guy called her fat and she says that this started all. since 2021 started her mom has been making comments on her when she eats like ""you are eating too much"", ""you are gaining weight"", etc. when she's around with other people she has to eat so she does it but when shes alone sometimes tries to avoid it. she drinks water and smoke to calm hunger and a few times tried to vomit but she couldn't. she told her mom that her comments were hurting her and that she has been struggling to eat but her mom just got mad. she also self harms and wanted to kill herself a few times but luckily she never tried it. her parents don't believe in therapy. after a lot of months of pushing they finally sent her with a therapist but after a month they stopped because ""it won't fix anything"" and ""it's a waste of money and time"". we've been together for a few months and I've been trying to be the most supportive I can for her. yesterday she told me about her eating problems. I knew that something was going on and tried to talk to her but she wasn't ready. I didn't knew it is that bad. her parents won't help her and I do everything that I can but its not enough. another thing that worries me is that she has a friend who is also struggling with this and they talk about it. the problem is that she's not supportive at all. she tells my gf ""tips not to eat"" whenever she asks. due to online classes it's impossible rn to see a school counselor so we agreed that she will try to write and email and send it to her school tutor and if she can't we will do it together the next time we see each other. we talked a lot about this yesterday. she told me she doesn't believe she's fat but I think she's scared of gaining weight.

834,eating_disorders,"I’ve struggled with my body image since I was eight, I’m now 14. I’ve also never had the best relationship with food for some reason. Because, I struggle with my body image, I would starve myself, which was pretty easy considering that I didn’t even like eating. I was around 12 when the self starvation began, it was on-and-off behaviour since sometimes I felt pretty good but sometimes I would eat as little as 200 calories per day. 

My sister is really thin. She’s underweight due to her inability to gain weight. I see her wrists, her collarbones, her spine, and I want that. I want to be thin, I want to have thin arms and legs. She is gaining weight and I’m glad to see it, she also struggles with her body image since she wishes she were at a healthy weight. 

My dad would always say I looked ‘full’. I think about it a lot. I remember trying to become fit, in a healthy manner and he said that, and I gave up. He’s been saying it since I was little and I didn’t pay much attention to it because I didn’t care, until I did. 

I’ve never talked to anyone besides two people about my eating issues. I never told my psychiatrist nor my therapist, and I want to, I really do, but I just can’t bring myself to. I know they’ll tell my parents and they’ll make me eat; they’ll pressure me into eating. That is terrifying. The idea of someone watching me eat while making me do it is just not great. I also don’t want to tell them because I don’t want to stress my parents out about me having another mental-health-related issue. I don’t want them to be tired of me and get mad at me.

I got surgery two weeks ago and haven’t eaten much since. I’m always nauseous and I want to throw up. The most calories I’ve had since would probably be 500. I weight myself when I get the chance. I used to be around 98 pounds and now I’m at 90. Ive lost around 8 pounds in the last two weeks. I know it isn’t healthy and I want help, but I can’t bring myself to do it. It’s my fault I got to this point. I should’ve stopped starving myself but I just couldn’t and now I barely know who hunger is. I’m not hungry anymore, all I am is dizzy and nauseous. If I eat properly I want to vomit, I’m just too full. 

I can hardly bring myself to finishing a meal. My mum made chicken with rice today and I ate two bites. I just couldn’t. Ive been in bed the past two weeks and I just can’t think.

I've eaten a lot less than I'm supposed to today. I really want to restrict again, and idk why.

Whatever it was, I'm already planning how to lose weight again, and how, and how much. But I'm supposed to be in recovery! Wtf is wrong with me??

842,eating_disorders,"Basically the title. I dont know if I'm in the right place. I'm very confused on why my body acts like this. When I'm super hungry and my stomach is growling I have no desire to eat, and I even laugh at the stomach noises. When I'm super full it's like my mouth is lonely and I have to eat something else too. 

On top of that if I haven't eaten my body barely reminds me a lot of the time. I'm a busy student who gets lost in her own head a lot so I forget about a lot of things, especially eating and staying hydrated. The first thing I ate today was some dessert my brother insisted on me trying, and it's like 7:30 at night. I have no problem eating, I'm not trying to lose weight, it's just that after one bite of something I cant bring myself to take another. I'm a dancer and a roller skater too so I know I should be healthy but I dont even get cues that I may not be. 

I'm pretty sure I function like I normally do even though by my calculations my calorie intake per day is usually under 1000. I do get tired sometimes but it's normal for someone as busy as me. I have no idea what's going on because I feel like this isnt normal but at the same time I cant bring myself to care as long as it doesnt affect anyone around me or my team.

846,eating_disorders,"I'm at a very early stage in my recovery (my first appointment with my dietitian was literally last week), and I know that weight gain is inevitable in recovery, but I'm kinda scared of it. Also, I've heard that in anorexia recovery, before weight redistribution happens, most of the weight gain goes to your belly. I feel like this could be really triggering for me, and if that's a necessary step in recovery, then I'll try to make my peace with it, but if there's a way to bypass or avoid it altogether, I'm wondering how this is possible (in a healthy way of course). So I was wondering if it is possible to gain mostly muscle instead of fat in recovery to reduce the amount of belly fat I gain. I'm not looking to become a body builder, nor am I trying to prevent weight gain-- I know that the number on the scale will go up either way, and it needs to in order for me to be healthy, but in one scenario I will find myself a lot more triggered by the appearance of my own body whereas in the other scenario I might be able to make peace with the weight gain because I will see my body growing stronger and more muscular. But then again, maybe this idea of ""fat=bad"" and ""muscle=good"" is just another facet of my eating disorder trying to disguise itself as ""healthy""

847,eating_disorders,"Not looking for diagnoses! 

Hey everyone :) I am Claire and I’m 22. Going straight to the point: sometimes I have a severe problem with solid food. I can’t swallow it, even though I’m hungry. This has been happening to me since I was little, and it usually happens when I have too much anxiety or when I am nervous. It has reached the point of me gagging whenever I smell or see food. Or think of it. 

Does this have a name? I’ve been to the psychiatrist/psychologist and they just say it’s because of the anxiety. But I don’t really believe that. 

Also, whenever I’m able to eat, I usually eat really slow, sometimes I choke, and have a hard time enjoying food overall. It’s not usual for me to eat normally and enjoy food. 

I really don’t want to keep being dependent on shakes, juices, soups, those things make me hungry in 1/2 hours. And being anxious makes me nervous of fainting so whenever I’m not able to eat, I PANIC all day and it makes it even harder to eat. 

My height is 160cm (5’2) and I weigh around 40-43 kg (90-94lb)

Anyway I still have to go weighing every week and last time I lost X kg. Not intentionally I was in the hospital a appendicitis so it wasn't really my fault but everyone in the clinic, where I go for my weighing treated it as such. Like seriously I got shamed for it. I also get in trouble if I just loose a couple gramms. I eat everything on my damn meal plan sometimes even a bit more and still its always my fault. Like I can controll everything. I am 17 sometimes the meal plan is not enough and I don't notice until I get weighed.

 I think the part that annoys me the most is getting shamed for every second of sport I do. 

Even after I lost the weight because of the appendicitis I was still in a healthy bmi range, not comfortably and I do have new meal plan to get the weight back on. I have no problem with that. 

By the way I have a therapist outside of the clinic and she wants me to get tested for ADHD because after the last 6 months and some talks to my parents she seems to suspect something.

I did the math and I’ve made myself throw up about once every 8 days since ~July. It’s usually in clusters rather than a consistent every-so-many-days kind of thing. 

I don’t truly binge beforehand because I feel in control of what I’m eating. I also usually leave some food in my stomach.

862,eating_disorders,"Ever since I was a child I was scared of food, I wouldn’t move on from baby food to solid &amp; when I did it was very restricted. Mostly beige food. I’m 25 now and still deal with the fear of food, trying new food is so difficult and mentally draining. I can do it but it’s hard to get past how scared I feel. It’s gotten better since I turned vegetarian, I always always hated meat &amp; only ate white meat anyways (beige lol). My therapist said ages ago that maybe the beige thing is about feeling safe cause it’s a safe colour, idk. I saw online something called ARFID - avoidance restrictive food intake disorder and can relate a lot to this. I was always just seen as a picky eater instead of having an actual disorder that’s preventing me from eating normally, I was malnourished as a child, never ate any fruit or veg, nothing healthy whatsoever. 
There’s so much that comes with this though, I don’t know how to cook which I find so embarrassing so I just don’t learn because I’m so ashamed. Nobody ever taught me or tried to and I can’t understand why. Anyway now I’m realising that I am using this as an excuse to purposely not eat, and I’m enjoying that. I’ve always had this fucked up thing in my mind that I feel proud when my food intake is really low, like I’ve accomplished something.

863,eating_disorders,"So I’m using my aunties account because my family know my reddit account and my Aunty and I are very close so she knows all these thoughts already..

I’m so sorry for the long post but I need to rant and i need help and advice and reassurance. 

I’m 16 years old and I think I have an eating problem. 
When I was 12 I started giving my lunch food away at school, not caring if I was hungry, but I always ate dinner. At night and on weekends I can eat all the junk food I like and not feel guilty, but sometimes I would try to eat and just start crying, or get an intense need to cry. 
I got into a physically and emotionally abusive relationship when I was 14, and it ended 9 months later when I was 15, and my weight had dropped from 53kg to 41kg in those nine months. I got it back up to 44kg (it’s been 10 months since we broke up) and I can’t seem to move it. I’m stuck in this cycle of wanting to gain weight and eating lots of carbs and proteins, and then i start feeling sick after every meal and I go back to barely eating until dinner, and even then I rarely finish my dinner. And even when my brain is so motivated to eat properly again, I’ll sit down for a meal and want to cry. I don’t know why I feel this way. I hate the way I look but It’s like I also don’t want to eat to get back to how I used to look. I look thin, compared to how I used to be. 
I am absolutely self conscious of how I look, and everyone around me makes it worse. My mum will grab my arm and comment on how thin it is, take photos of me when I’m not looking and get me to look at it while she points out how skinny I am, she tells me I look horrible in certain clothes because of how skinny I am, and my dad does it too, so do some of my aunties and uncles. They say they’re just worried but they’re going about it the wrong way, they just make me feel worse. I have spoken to them multiple times about how it makes me feel and they don’t stop. 
My mum hopes for “perfect children” and does it to my older brother too, except he is overweight and when he said the only reason he got a little skinner was because he was starving himself, she said “at least you’re skinnier!” and always calls him fat.. 
I do not vomit my food out and I do eat, sometimes large amounts, so I feel this isn’t serious enough to have an “eating disorder”, but my periods are even irregular now and sometimes the thought of eating makes me so upset, and I’m constantly checking my weight on the scales, and peoples comments are making me self esteem so low. 
I don’t know what is wrong or what to do.

870,eating_disorders,Today I realized I am eating the same amount I used to a couple of years back. But I am not as thin as I was then. I must be a good 30 pounds heavier. Part of me (the responsible part) wants to get help and get back on a healthier diet. But the other is REALLY nostalgic about how skinny I was back then and I know that if I keep it going a bit more I could get there again. I didn't do it on purpose.

875,eating_disorders,"So I've already talked to my therapist, an eating disorder specialist, close friends, family, and others about my ED, and the general consensus is that yes, I do have an eating disorder, and yes, it is almost certainly anorexia. But I decided to go to my GP as well, just to see if he had anything else to say, and also to see if he could give me an \*official\* diagnosis, because then I would feel wayyy more validated. But oh god did it backfire. I swear to god, it's like he read a book on how to invalidate someone in their ED. First of all, he didn't seem to understand that an eating disorder is a MENTAL illness, NOT a PHYSICAL illness (even though as we all know, it can have physical symptoms). He didn't ask me any questions about my thought process surrounding food/exercise, and he hardly even asked me any questions about my behaviors related to food/exercise either. Almost everything he talked about/ asked me about was in regards to the PHYSICAL signs of an ED, not the mental ones. Like one of the first things he said was ""well your weight seems to be stable,"" which isn't even true, like yes I weigh the same as I did the last time I had an appointment, but that's because A) my last appointment wasn't even that long ago and B) I was already struggling with my eating back then. But if you look at the bigger picture, from like a year ago or longer, I have definitely lost weight over time. Also WEIGHT IS NOT THE DETERMINING FACTOR OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE HAS AN ED! How many times do I have to say it -- it's a MENTAL illness, not a PHYSICAL one. So on top of that, he kept focusing on the fact that my bloodwork came back normal (except for my hemoglobin or something), so I don't appear to be malnourished. Again, focusing on physical symptoms rather than mental causes. And then he wrapped it up by saying ""well, I think it's good that you're trying to do something about this now while it's not that bad before it gets worse."" Cue the whole ""I'm not sick enough"" overthinking spiral.

In summary, the healthy part of my brain is pissed off and knows that he doesn't know what he's talking about. But the ED part of my brain is like ""SEE??!! You're not sick enough! If you had lost more weight then he'd take you seriously. Now you need to keep losing weight and eating poorly until it gets 'bad enough' to earn a diagnosis! But until then, you're not valid!""

876,eating_disorders,"So I have been kinda in recovery for about a year, I didn’t do anything special I just kinda stopped having the thoughts naturally somehow (learning about fatphobia has been mega helpful though). I knew I had put on weight because I could see I was visibly much bigger and a lot of my clothes weren’t fitting anymore but I was trying to ignore it and I was avoiding weighing myself at all costs because I cannot handle knowing how much bigger I was. Well I had to weigh myself for something today and I am a whole stone heavier than I was this time last year and 30lbs more than my lowest weight and this is by far the most I have weighed in my whole life and I cannot cope. 

On top of this I have had to move back in with my parents as I have been having a bad CFS/ME flair up which means I am essentially bed bound and cannot have any exercise at all as I can barely stand so I am just eating and eating and not even doing daily tasks worth of exercise. My parents are huge triggers for my ED as they are always dieting and making comments calling me fat, a pig, grabbing my fat etc. They are on a diet right now and do everything I used to do like refuse to have carbs, drink lots of water, eating super small portions etc and I can’t deal with it. My mum also keeps making comparisons of me and my weight to Nikki Graeme who sadly died recently from anorexia and saying things like ‘you could never be as skinny as her’ ‘at least she had anorexia properly’ ‘she weighed half of what you used to when she died’ etc

I don’t really know what I am expecting from posting this but this is more than I can handle and I need advice on how to cope. Do I join them on the diet?

877,eating_disorders,"My(22) GF(21) has been struggling with anorexia since high school, but over the past year has gotten extremely worse, and she even started purging. She recently had a seizure and was hospitalized, too. She sometimes tells me really severe suicidal thoughts like ""no one would even care if I died"" or when I ask her if she's planning to kill herself she says ""Im still mulling it over.""

Because her parents are homophobic I can't physically go to her house and be there for her, and her parents up until VERY recently were extremely unsupportive and actively horrible caretakers and in denial about the whole thing (they argued about if they should take her to the hospital or not while she was seizing.)

I know this disorder stems entirely from lack of control over your life so I try to be the absolute least controlling SO I can be and apply the least amount of pressure I can, even when I'm scared for her safety. Ive always been the anxious type, but lately its been getting to the point where I'm ACTUALLY scared she's going to get herself killed.

Recently she lost her only other supportive person, her therapist, who refused to treat her if she doesn't go to iop or resi. After a spiral and a lot of talk of suicide, and then her goin MIA for hours I decided I couldn't sit idly by anymore, I was worried the lack of support system was really the nail in the coffin, given that her spiral was really focused on the idea that she feels alone, and her therapist broke up with her. So after hours of angsting over the right thing to do I cautiously texted her best friend of ~6 years and told him about her disorder and situation in hopes that he could provide some positive influence in person, since I can't. (He was extremely supportive and we started to come up with plans to help her.)

We've been together for 9 years and I've never done anything like this b/c I hate taking choices away from her, when thats what this is all about. But I felt like her life was at risk. After a few days I told her about telling him, because I hate keeping things from her and she hasn't talked to me since. I understand that she probably feels betrayed and hurt and I don't blame her, and I feel awful, but I also don't know if I should regret the decision or how to apologize in the right way. 


Is it ever okay to start making risky/big decisions about your SO or close friend during mental health crisis situations, knowing that they might not consent to it?

Should I agree to never do something like that again? I hate being conflicted with her, but I'm starting to feel desperate, and like these decisions might make or break if she survives or not.

Any feedback is appreciated. I just want to do the best thing for her.

I'm a healthy weight and very muscular (for a female) without a lot of physical activity so throughout my life I haven't paid too much attention to weight or body image, but I've always had a strange relationship with food.

My appetite changes drastically (seemingly) without reason and it's nearly impossible for me to eat when I'm not hungry without either distracting myself and putting a small bowl of snacks in front of me or feeling extremely nauseous and even throwing up sometimes. When it's really bad even the smell of food or the thought of eating will make me nauseous.

I always eat when I'm hungry and I never feel like I'm eating too much but I often feel like I'm eating too little, yet can't seem to force myself to eat more.

I've had some issues with this for about 3 or 4 years but I started an antidepressant medication recently that has some appetite-suppressing side effects and I've noticed it's been harder than normal to eat enough to sustain myself.

882,eating_disorders,"This is going to be all over the place, but the long story short is that I’ve had an eating disorder for about 17 years. I’ve never starved myself (eat tons of good food, but very healthy, which is admittedly a little disordered) but my purge is exercise. A lot of exercise, and it has always been this way. I won’t go into numbers, but I’m conceivably 40 pounds underweight and do hours of exercise every day. It’s not high-impact like running or biking, but rather the whole Jillian Michaels’ “30 Day Shred” DVD three to four times a day and long walks when weather permits. Given my weight and the obsessive nature of my exercise (I also have OCD), I shouldn’t be doing anything - or maybe just an hour a day - but I feel like I can’t stop and fill any extra time with more activity even though I dread it every day.

I was in residential treatment out of state for five weeks at the end of 2019, gained 20 pounds by eating an INSANE amount of food and no movement, but came home due to insurance and lost the weight within five months. Now I have a job I love (work from home though, so more access to DVD workouts and walks) but still try and fit in all the exercise, which is stressful, and I can’t eff up this new job. My days revolve around it and I HATE it so much. No ED therapists in my area will see me because of my low weight (ironic, eh?) and I know I just have to cut it down to an hour or so a day, but I feel like I have no sense of what’s “normal” and how to fill those hours I fill with exercise. (Work is slow right now and contractually can’t do extra freelance work.)

So logically I know - cut it down, don’t cut down your food to compensate, gain the weight so your brain works better and you’re free from this hell - but doing it? Feels impossible. I told myself that today I’m cutting it in half - at least for today - but it already feels so wrong even though I know I need 20-40 pounds to not look and feel like death.

884,eating_disorders,"I (25F) scored my (current) dream job working remote for a tech company based out of NYC about 2 months ago. 

I have never not succeeded in a job. I have always be proud of my work ethic and confident in my future success. This is my first remote job, specifically remote training. But I have been wfh for the past year due to covid so I figured that eventually I would ramp at a normal speed, if not just slightly slower. Well I was wrong.

Today my boss put me on probation due to my “poor performance and lack of significant progress”. I have two weeks to get my shit together or they will let me go. This came out of absolutely no where as far as the signs my boss gave me that things were in bad shape (there were no signs). That said, I figured this day would come eventually. 

I started using laxatives and restrictive eating at the being of quarantine in April 2020. It’s been a year and I am now binging/purging and/or starving myself everyday. Ive always suffered from obsessive behaviors and anxiety, and combined that with living alone in my apartment for 7 weeks with nothing to do but cook, eat, and smoke, I became rather fixated with losing weight quickly and easily. 

I’ve lost about 15 pounds in the last year, nothing completely shocking but it is the thinnest I’ve been since high school. I look good. Trendy clothes that I would never have worn even in college fit me now. People have noticed my weight loss, though most of them congratulate me (oof). 

But my brain is literally garbage. I have a next to no short term memory. I have a difficult time forming cohesive thoughts and sentences. I’m exhausted, achy, and slow every single day. I drink two ice coffees each morning, and typically binge a large high calorie meal (chipotle, burgers + fries, multiple boxes of Mac n cheese) after work and purge it immediately after. 

I know that my ED is almost entirely to blame for my atypical failure at work. My body tells me every day by barely making it to 5pm without a nap, and immediately responding with a boost of focus and energy whenever I cave and eat a snack midday. And despite knowing how wrong it is that I’m doing this to my body and brain, and how out of control I know I’ve become, I’m just not ready to tell anyone yet. 

So, what do I do? Am I really about to let myself lose my job because I can’t tell my manager or hr? I honesty just can’t imagine telling my boss, a person I have never met in person and barely know, I have an ED over a fucking zoom call?

I just recently got into a relationship. Things are looking up for me. I'm happier than I've been in any other relationship I've had before. Now don't get me wrong, my boyfriend is an amazing guy. He makes me feel so very on top of the world, and I'm not uncomfortable around him. I just cannot eat around him.

While I haven't been clinically diagnosed, I've been binge eating for about five (5) years now. The thought of eating in front of people hasn't really had an effect on me until maybe like two (2) years ago. Before, I would jump at the opportunity to go out to lunch or have nice dinners with friends. Things have changed recently. With family stuff and the pandemic, the thought of eating around people makes me utterly sick to my stomach. The only people I can really eat out with at a restaurant is my immediate family, and even then they're the source of the problem. I don't even like eating with them or making food because all they do is stare me down and make rude comments about the way I food or the food I eat.

Fast forward to Valentine's Day 2021. Boyfriend invites me over for a nice dinner that his mom had cooked. As much as I had wanted to eat the food she made for us, I couldn't bring myself to. I really wanted to skip and just celebrate next year, but I knew he had put in a lot of effort. So I came over. Everything was good until he wanted to eat, and not going to lie I was getting hungry. I wasn't trying to wait until I got home either. So I agreed to eat. We head to the kitchen and I took for for myself, and he took food for himself. As we sat down, I couldn't help but notice that my plate had more food than his. I felt full instantly.  We both had stopped eating, and he kinda just took out food away without me saying anything. 

I explain to him how I felt that night a few days after. He says I have nothing to worry about, that I shouldn't feel bad for eating more than him because he had eaten earlier before I came and wasn't all that hungry.

A couple weeks later, restrictions are slightly lifted and now you are allowed to go to restaurants with people who are not members of your household. We had been talking about going to restaurants when restrictions allow and when it is safe to do so. So I suggest the idea of going out to eat pho! I had never eaten it before and I wanted to try it and then go for a walk. He was on board. The idea was good in my head until I actually started thinking about what I had agreed to. The thought of me eating in front of him made me sick instantly and thinking about how many calories I would've consumed in front of him made me feel even more shitty.

897,eating_disorders,"DISCLAIMER: I don’t know if I have an ED and am not claiming I do. I simply think I need some advice or to know I anyone relates. I don’t want to invalidate anyone who actually has or is recovering from an ED! 

Some background info:
I have severe ADD and tend to hyper fixate on different foods (ex. Only eating tuna salad and crackers for 2 weeks). I take concerta everyday for the ADD which is an appetite suppressant and forget to eat at times.  I was recently plant based and focus on only eating foods within those options, however I still ate fish. Currently I’m struggling in nursing school and am constantly studying or going to class. If I’m not studying I’m thinking about studying or what I’m supposed to being doing and am stressed/overwhelmed to the MAX. On top of all of this I also have untreated anxiety (diagnosed) and can’t sleep or eat when I’m stressed. 

The issue:
At the beginning of December I weighed 106-109 pounds. I weigh 92 now. I have stopped the plant based diet to try and regain the weight but I don’t remember to eat until 10:30-11 at night and only manage to eat a small amount of food. That’s typically the only time I eat. Some days I don’t take my concerta to try and see if I’ll eat but I still don’t. I KNOW I’m losing weight and I need to gain it back but at the same time it’s like I don’t want too. I don’t weigh myself regularly or stare at myself in the mirror. At this point I’m developing a thigh gap which I’ve NEVER had and can’t eat more than a small amount without feeling full. I’m constantly cold and I have basically no muscle left. I’m so confused because I know it’s not healthy and I know it’s not good for me but I don’t think I want to gain the weight back. I just keep watching it fall off. If I weighed myself today and it read 98 pounds I think that I’d stop myself from eating, but if I dropped to 89 I’d think “maybe we should eat something”. I’m confused by the satisfaction of watching it fall and then the stress of knowing it’s not healthy.",,I think I need help,2,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,mmv6zr,1,that_applepie,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/mmv6zr/i_think_i_need_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/mmv6zr/i_think_i_need_help/,1617898364,385,0,0,0,-1,1,"Severe ADD, hyper fixation on food, untreated anxiety, appetite suppressant medication",harmful,"Unintentional weight loss from 106-109 pounds to 92 pounds, Developing a thigh gap and having no muscle left, Feeling full after eating small amounts of food, Conflicted feelings about weight loss","Untreated anxiety, hyper fixation on certain foods, taking Concerta, stress from nursing school",harmful,"Unintentional weight loss from forgetting to eat or not feeling hungry, Confusion and conflicting feelings about wanting to regain weight but also feeling satisfied watching it fall off","Hyper fixation on certain foods, ADD medication as an appetite suppressant, untreated anxiety, being constantly stressed and overwhelmed",harmful,"Unintentional weight loss from not eating enough, Feeling conflicted about wanting to gain weight back but also feeling satisfied watching weight fall off, Experiencing physical symptoms such as feeling cold and having no muscle mass"

All The Parts Screaming

 

 

As I allow the little girl to speak, what was never suppose to be spoken. The darkest secrets within the box never to be open, all the other parts coming out screaming trying to keep me safe.

 

The part that believes ill never be seen as a whole person , that ill always be a target, there well be a price to pay , that I have to get me before anyone else ever gets me again  , as I put on the super woman mask ,as I act as if I’m on top of the world , as I come off as confident and peachy keen smile on my face , as ED does a dance with super woman to help fit the mask

 

As the two sides of ED always seem to fight witch is the best fit , this time around as Ana , keeps me in a haze as I silently fad away , as my mind is to busy with calories being burned , and consumed and how to have just a bit less each day , the praise from others as the collar bones stick out just a bit more , as the perfection side comes out , as I  become a workaholic and always running all around the hospital not wanting a real conversation with anyone , as my wall is up higher than ever , as I hide away , as Anna screams the silent fuck you to all the soulless men that went inside me before I finished elementary school , the way of getting every little bit of them off of me , to no longer be a target, to no longer be covered in sin , to somehow be forgiven , and to finally be loved within the jennings box

 

As Mia screams, and she’s always screaming the anger and hatred wanting every little bit out, she is the allotment silent scream. hiding away in a empty room, tasting all the sinful foods ,the sugar running threw my body as I push down all the thoughts , and images racing threw my mind , as I push it all down with food tell the point I almost cant breath , wash it all down with water , let it all swirl around inside me for 10 mins ,and head to a locked safe bathroom , blare the music to drain out the sound of the endless purging until nothing but blood comes out , the feeling of him finally out of me , at lest for this short time , so exhausted finally able to pass out , with a free mind , to awake into a peachy keen mode , to step into the shower to prepare for the perfect mask ,as I step out , put the pound of makeup on ,as I count all the bones I can see , as I start to feel free to speak , to be a “bitch” as long as I purge it all out later that somehow it evens everything out , and soon anna and mia blend into one and I truly disappear

 

As I start to wish for life to just end, soon every time I purge I bage to not awake for my heart to just finally give out, and soon the drink ends my night able to go into old modes of preforming sexually

 

As death comes near, the little girl and core self-starts to scream out the truth, to not let them win, as the anger overwhelms me , the seizure part comes in to turn everything off , as if to push the restart button , as I awake feeling lost and not sure witch side to fallow on .

Tell the anger starts to win again, the anger that the people who abused my mind body and soul, because they believed id never be able to tell, they believed id one day be trapped inside my body and mind unable to speak, to stand or walk to be forever trapped. If I died from ED would be there silent death, it would take their fear of the truth coming out that I was completing the hell they started

 

As the part screams I can’t die , I can speak , I can speak for the others who truly trapped inside their body , I can scream out the truth and one of the very few who is able to do so , that part screams the loudest don’t you dare let them win

911,eating_disorders,"so my(17) little sister(14) has been in a full-time residential facility since early januery and b/c of the whole pandemic, coupled w/ the fact that pretty much the entire facility is immunocompromised, I haven't seen her at all in that time. Probably because of my age, I haven't been allowed in any of the 'family' group therapy sessions, and she has *very* limited phone time, so we haven't really talked at all in that time. 

She is coming home this Friday, and is staying for 4 days before transferring to a part-time (5 days per week, weekends and nights off) facility that is 3 hours away from where we currently live. We don't want her making that drive twice a day, so my parents are going to rent an apartment nearby so that they can be near her. I will be staying home, in school, housesitting. So these four days are all I'm really gonna have for a while.

I've been wanting to talk at least to her therapist (or whoever at the facility would be appropriate) for a while about how to act around her when she comes home, but she'll be home in 2 days and it's not looking like that'll happen. I just. I really don't want this to be awkward or uncomfortable for her. Does anyone have advice on how to make her transition easier? Should I be offering her snacks? Is there any safe way to mention food? How do I make family meals not suck? ik I'm supposed to avoid mentioning her figure, and I haven't seen her in 3 months so it might not be true, but what if I want to say something like 'you look good?'

912,eating_disorders,"(I posted this in r/mentalhealth the other day but I wanted to post it here too to see if you guys had anything different to say.)

I'm not sure if I have an eating disorder or not. I'm scared to talk to my doctor or psychiatrist or therapist about it. I keep telling myself that it's not ""bad enough"" to be a ""real"" eating disorder. But then again, I've heard that it's common for people with eating disorders to think that, and that that's just the ""ED voice"" talking. But how do I tell the difference?

Also sometimes I think that maybe I'm just doing it for attention, and therefore it couldn't be a real ED, because sometimes when people say something to me like ""you don't eat enough/ you need to eat more"" or ""you're too skinny"" or ""you're so bony, you need to gain some weight,"" it feels really validating. If I had a REAL eating disorder, I wouldn't like it when people noticed and said things like that, would I? I've heard/read that people with EDs are often very secretive about their behavior and don't want anyone to notice. But I almost WANT people to notice. It makes me feel like they care about me, and then if fuels me to keep doing it so that they continue to care and don't abandon me. (Probably sounds really pathetic, doesn't it...) Sometimes I don't want people to notice certain things though. For example, I never let others see me enter my calories into the calorie-counting app on my phone, and I make sure I'm in a private place where no one will see/hear me when I make myself throw up (but I've only done that 3 or 4 times). Also, I like some people to notice/say certain things, but not others. For example, I like it when my boyfriend tells me I need to eat more, but I feel super uncomfortable when my mom says the exact same thing.

I feel like if I do have an ED, it's very inconsistent and doen't fit into certain parts of the ED descriptions and symptom checklists I've read. For example, I do still eat high-calorie foods like ice cream and chocolate sometimes. I'm a bit underweight, but not severely underweight -- my bmi is about 17.7 I think. I don't weigh myself every single day. I do exercise a lot, and I'm pretty anal about making sure I go for a run every day, but I allow myself a day off each week. (If I take more than 2 days off in 1 week, I feel ""fat"" and guilty for it.) I'm not losing weight super rapidly. I've been eating at a calorie deficit most days, but I don't restrict like crazy to like 500 calories per day or something. I have made myself throw up before, but not often. Maybe like 3 times in the past month? And before that I hadn't done it in over a year.

I don't know what to do, and I'm too scared to talk to anyone irl about it yet, so that's why I'm ranting to internet strangers. Honestly, what scares me even more than the possibility of being diagnosed with an ED, is the possibility of NOT being diagnosed with an ED. That probably sounds really weird but what I mean by that is that I'm scared of being told that feeling this way and doing these things is just normal, and life just sucks this bad. (I remember feeling the same way before I was diagnosed with depression.) Also I'm scared that if i DO get diagnosed with an ED, that they'll stop me from losing weight and force me to gain weight. Tbh, part of me really wants to be able to eat more and not constantly have to worry about calories and feel guilty for it, and to be reassured by a medical professional that it's okay and healthy, but the other part of me is completely freaked out at the idea of gaining weight and losing all the ""progress"" I've made. And that part of me is also afraid that once I eat more/gain weight I'll lose control and be unable to stop somehow, and then I'll get fat.

TL;DR: I think I might have an eating disorder, but I'm not sure. I keep wavering back and forth about whether it's bad enough to be a ""real"" eating disorder, or if I'm just faking it or making it up or something.

I have tried everything I can show her that it is worth it to rule out that she has this condition. I've become very educated on the topic and have provided very worthy reasonings to her in my opinion. Not only that, but she has had a PCP and dietician tell her that she has an eating disorder, but will simply start seeing a different doctor. She has just about every symptom you could possibly have that is associated with eating disorders including complete lack of a period, hormone issues, dry skin, thinning hair, very low heart rate, and more. She does not eat at all around me besides one or two bites if I suggest we should eat after a workout for example.

Most recently, I've sort of put my foot down and suggested we see a therapist together that specializes in eating disorders after attempting to talk to her at least 10 different occasions. She was completely unwilling until I told her that this would not go away, and I'm unsure if our relationship will work out in what I thought was the most loving way possible. I've been trying to get through to her for over 6 months now, and she would either cry or get angry at me for doing so. Most recently, she is completely withdrawn towards me and talks to me like I'm scum and treating her so poorly. She says I'm the only one who feels this way, and all her friends think I'm this crazy a hole who needs to mind his own business (including her family).

This is becoming detrimental to my own happiness, and I feel like we're on the verge of a breakup.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been happy with my body for a long time. Never in my 14 years of life have I ever thought there was anything wrong with it up until now. All my life I've been told ""Wow you're so tiny"", ""You're so skinny."" I've been asked things like : ""Do you even eat?"", 'Do you purge/ have an ED?"" And to the last one, I'd always say no. People have fit their entire hands over my wrists, hell, I can almost do that. For some reason I've always liked being told and asked these things. It reassured me I guess. A little over a year ago I think, I had a doctor's appointment to refill a medication. When I was weighed, I was told I was 81-83 pounds. That was a week where I hadn't really eaten much of anything. But that was different. I had an appetite back then. Recently, another doctor's appointment to refill a medication, and to be prescribed antidepressants. This time, I weighed at 94 pounds. And then that's when the thoughts started pouring in: ""I have to fix this"", ""I can't eat for a little while, then this will be solved"". I've completely lost my appetite. I will eat something like chips, a small serving of eggs, anything small. Occasionally a small bit of my school lunch. But when dinner rolls around it's not so easy. A few weeks before this, I had been brought dinner. I wasn't hungry. So I just set the plate in my bed side table drawer to rot. Then we see today. Me, a few minutes away from typing this post, throwing away the food in the dumpster outside my apartment complex and soaking the plate in hot water. The same thing happened to last nights dinner. I begrudgingly took a few bites and set it aside until this morning. I threw it away, soaked the bowl in hot water. I was with my therapist yesterday and we ate at sonic as we talked. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. That was the biggest portion of food I'd had all week. A little recently I notice that If I put my hand into to position where I could see my tendons protruding, only two were visible. That was when I really thought there was an issue. Not only that but I will sometimes examine the amount of fat on my face, and if my torso is at all anywhere away from an hour glass shape I panic.

919,eating_disorders,"This is a crosspost from r/mentalhealth. I edited it slightly.

 I don't really know where to start... Basically, I think I \*might\* have an eating disorder. I know that reddit is not the place to go for medical advice/a diagnosis, but I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just a discussion. Also, I'm afraid to tell anyone about this irl because I honestly don't want them to stop me from losing weight. Which could be a red flag that it's an eating disorder. But at the same time, I feel like it's not extreme/severe enough to be an eating disorder. Idk.

So basically I'm trying to lose weight, and I have been for a while. I have lost a few pounds, but not much. I'm not doing anything super extreme, like crash diets or not eating for days, which is what normally comes to mind when one pictures an eating disorder. Really all I've been doing is using MyFitnessPal to track my calories, and I have it set to ""lose 1 lb/week"" which is not that bad, and sometimes I don't even reach that goal. So this probably doesn't sound like an eating disorder at all, just normal/healthy weight loss. But the thing is, I'm already technically underweight, according to BMI (my BMI is 18.1 -- but I've heard of anorexics with a BMI of 16 or less, so I guess this isn't really that bad). Yet I still want to lose weight. And logically, I know that this is f\*cked up and not healthy, mentally or physically, but I can't help but want to lose weight. See, the thing is I KNOW I'm not fat; logically, I KNOW I don't NEED to lose weight. I don't look in the mirror and ""see a fat person"" -- like I don't look in the mirror and just hallucinate fat rolls that just aren't there. But it's more like, I look in the mirror, and I think to myself ""I could be skinnier, I wish I was skinnier, I would look so much better if I was skinnier"" Or on the other hand, instead of looking at the whole picture, I zoom in on certain parts of my body, parts that have any bodyfat on them at all and think ""ugh I just wish I could get rid of THAT. I wish that \[insert body part here\] was smaller, thinner, firmer, etc."" Also, every time I see another person (especially girls/women, since I am female) who appears to be thinner than me, I find myself comparing myself to them and feeling really jealous and wishing I was skinnier, and then being mad at myself for not being skinny enough.

So I guess what I'm saying is that I don't think I'm restricting my calories enough for it to be considered an eating disorder. Like when I think of an eating disorder, I think of someone who only eats like maybe 500 calories a day or less. But I always eat around 1500-2000 probably. However does my mindset around food/body image and that fact that I'm underweight mean that it could be an eating disorder?

Also, a few other details that might be important:

1. I am very active. I run several miles every day, and I also dance, walk around a lot, and do workout classes at the gym like yoga and cycling.
2. I have forced myself to throw up before (for the purpose of losing weight/to avoid weight gain), but it's not something I do all the time. I've only done it maybe 5 or 6 times ever, and 3 times in the past month.
3. I am in therapy and take meds for diagnosed depression and anxiety. (But I haven't talked about anything in this post with my therapist.)
4. People in my life often tell me that I am too skinny, should gain weight, should eat more, etc. This includes people like my mom, my brother, my friends, and even my boyfriend.

TL;DR: I think I might have an eating disorder, but I'm not sure if it's bad enough to \*actually\* be an eating disorder. I count my calories, but I don't restrict to an extreme level. I am physically active. I am underweight, but not severely: BMI is 18.1. I have body image issues, and it's not that I see myself as ""fat,"" but rather that I wish I was skinnier and want to eradicate any bit of fat on my body. I've made myself throw up a few times, but not on a regular basis. I have depression and anxiety. Do I have an eating disorder? If not, do I have body dysmorphia, or anything else like that? Or is this just normal?

I’m a 20 year old female who, as a senior in highschool, ran into some issues. I only ate a meal a day for about 2 weeks and lost 10 pounds, along with trying to make myself throw up. I went from 120-110 at the time but eventually stopped doing that. Flash forward I’m a junior in college and I’ve lost about 10-15 pounds in the last 2 weeks-a month. Eating more than a meal a day freaks me out and my calorie intake is all I think about. I’m at 130 now and was at 140 which is a healthy weight for a 5’5 girl, but I’m no where near happy and don’t want to stop. It’s addictive and I’m scared. It’s torture. I struggle with pretty bad OCD and learned that BDD is very closely related so that seems very probable to me. Basically, I don’t like to eat and when I do I often feel sick.

(TW: i will be discussing in detail, won’t get very graphic but please stay safe 🤍 i will be using numbers PLEASE don’t read if that triggers you) i’ve had body image issues since i was around 11-12, i always thought i was too fat even though i’ve never been overweight. i’m more on the petite side naturally, i’m 5 feet 2 inches tall right now (i’m 17, have been this height since 14). at 11-12 i would say i was around 5 foot and 105 pounds. i ate normally, not always the healthiest but yk i was a kid. my mom would constantly be on my back about how i didn’t eat healthy enough which i think contributed to my body image issues (she never called me fat though). but basically i’ve struggled with body image issues my entire teen years, but ate normally. when i was 14-15 i weighed in at 117 pounds at a doctors appointment and wore a size 4-6. i lost some weight after making an effort to be more healthy (i didn’t do anything unhealthy at this time but i did fantasize about it). i got down to around 110-115, wore a size 2, and even though this was perfectly healthy for my height i couldn’t be happy with it. this is where i feel like i really started developing a problem. i’m always looking at my body, and always finding something wrong with it. i don’t starve myself but i do go out of my way to eat less than i should, though i still eat. i would guess i consume anywhere from 500-1,000 calories on a typical day, but i try to keep it at less than 1,000 and lately the average number keeps decreasing. i weigh 105 pounds right now, which is still healthy for my height but close to underweight. i can’t stop the thoughts in my brain, i feel like i have to lose more weight and go down another size (i wear a size 0-2 right now) and i just keep feeling like i have to be smaller and skinnier and ‘perfect’. i just don’t know what to do. any thoughts?? advice?? thank you so much if you read all of this",,do i have an eating disorder??,1,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,mcbdpd,1,Final-Pool1431,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/mcbdpd/do_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/mcbdpd/do_i_have_an_eating_disorder/,1616606750,419,0,0,1,-1,1,"Body image issues, restricting calorie intake to less than 1,000 calories per day, desire to lose more weight despite being at a healthy weight for their height",harmful,"Experiencing obsessive thoughts about body size and weight, Restricting calorie intake to unhealthy levels, Desire to lose more weight despite being at a healthy weight for their height",Body image issues and restriction of calorie intake,harmful,"Obsessive thoughts about weight and body image, Restricting calorie intake to less than 1,000 calories per day, Desire to be smaller and skinnier","Body image issues, restricting food intake",harmful,"Obsessive thoughts about weight and size, Restricting food intake to less than 1,000 calories per day, Wanting to lose more weight and be ""perfect"""
922,eating_disorders,"After years of binge-eating during stressful situations and feeling horrible about myself and my body, I (19e) (e stands for enby, aka, non-binary) finally broke tonight and made myself throw up my dinner. 

Before throwing up I went on a binge and had 3 different dishes (one of which I stole from a friend bc I ran out of food but was desperate to eat; I already apologized and I feel guilty as hell for eating it). I was horribly bloated by the end of it and just couldn't handle the guilt and the sight of my huge belly sticking out. 

I think the reason I've done this is bc lately I've been feeling a lot of pressure in my life; pressure to do well in school (I'm struggling with studying), to stay in the closet, etc, and I've been feeling lonelier and lonelier without seeing my friends irl due to covid. 

I feel like there's so many expectations of me that I can't live up to and that I'm constantly letting people down. I'm constantly thinking that i'm a horrible person so I do things like steal food from a friend to see if they realise how horrible I am and leave me.

923,eating_disorders,"Apologies if this comes off as a rant, I'm just quite upset by all of this and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here, so I thought I'd go to Reddit for help.

So, to keep this as brief as possible, I was just having dinner with my family. We had quiche and my dad commented that my mum hadn't eaten her crusts. She said that she'd gained weight recently (which, according to her, she always is) and that was why. I said that she shouldn't trust her scales, that her weight fluctuates throughout the day, and that nutritionists recommend not focusing on the number. My brother started making fun of my weight, so I kicked him under the table (not great on my part, I'm fully aware). My parents weren't happy for obvious reasons, and the conversation escalated.

My mum said that she knew more because she had over 30 years more experience. I said that all that meant was that she has been exposed to the toxicity of diet culture for longer, while my generation have been exposed to body diversity and positivity movements as well. She snapped that she wouldn't take advice from someone who's weight yo-yos so much.

As you might be able to understand, this really hurt my feelings. I've got a history with disordered eating from my teen years and had a relapse last year, so this was really painful to hear. However, my parents don't know about any of this history.

My dad instinctively supported my mum, said that I shouldn't complain that she commented on my weight gain because I commented on how much she eats. I would never comment on my mum's body because I know the harm this can do, but I could literally tell you exactly what she eats everyday and it's under 1200 calories. I feel really guilty commenting on how much she eats, but as I've said I'm highlighting her under-eating while she highlights me eating a normal amount of food, which is really triggering considering my history.

How should I talk to my dad about this?

He's a good husband so he will instinctively take my mum's side no matter what, but it feels like he's just enabling. Also, my mum's consistent comments on whether I should have a second serving, that I've gained weight, etc. are so painful for me to hear, and partly triggered my disordered eating (as well as my brother's constantly calling me fat and ugly even when I was underweight). My mum's comments only dwindle when I'm a lower weight and eating less.

And, finally, how can I navigate these arguments? I always come off as such a know-it-all and I have such an awful temper, but I also am the most passive person ever so I always roll over when I get into an argument :((

Sorry that this didn't end up brief lol, thanks for any advice or support, either would be appreciated because I don't have anyone to talk to about this ://",,How to deal with family's hurtful comments?,23,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,malga9,1,FlimsyCompetition722,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/malga9/how_to_deal_with_familys_hurtful_comments/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/malga9/how_to_deal_with_familys_hurtful_comments/,1616413149,507,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments and criticism from family members about weight and eating habits, exposure to toxic diet culture",harmful,"The writer has a history of disordered eating, which is triggered by their family members' comments about their weight and eating habits, The writer is struggling to navigate arguments with their family members and feels guilty about commenting on their mother's eating habits",Negative comments on weight and eating habits from family members,harmful,"Triggering for the person with a history of disordered eating, Causing feelings of guilt and shame, Family members are not supportive or understanding of the person’s struggles",Family members making negative comments about weight and eating habits,harmful,"The negative comments from family members are triggering for the writer, who has a history of disordered eating, The argument with family members is causing emotional distress for the writer"
924,eating_disorders,"I really like this guy I am with at this moment. We are together and hangout out on some days. We are getting serious. I love the way he makes me feel as if I am worth loving. I hate having an eating disorder. The thought of being loved for who I am - my personality and body- scares me. It makes me want to stop having these thoughts to want to restrict. We have been friends for 2 1/2 years on and off since I have been unable to keep my emotions in check. Before we used to fight over not me wanting to hang out and not opening up to the reason why. Whenever I restrict, I feel normal, I have the motivation to hang out. Because at that moment it feels like food doesn't control me, I control it.  Whenever I go into a period of overeating to an excessive amount, I feel like everyone hates me because I am ""fat"". I don't know why restricting makes me feel happy and calm. It's weird since at the same time I am so tired and in pain. It scares me to feel the wanting of food and eating not in control. On days where I try to eat a normal amount to ""recover"", I just eat in such excess without control. Anyway, whenever I was with him, he said that he liked my body and I should not try to change myself.  I am mainly writing this since I want to try and stop wanting to change myself. What is so stupid about an eating disorder for me is that I am ok with my body rn. But I don't want to stop restricting and hating myself. It seems the easiest way to give me happiness. The constant self-deprecating thoughts and the restriction is my normal. I constantly just want to get worse. Getting worse is what I am looking forward to, but I don't want him to get in my way. I don't want to lose him as I care for him, but feeling cared for is just interesting. He doesn't like me becoming distant and self-sabotaging our relationship since it is emotionally manipulative. Punishment by ending relationships gives me a high and another reason to restrict. Feeling worthless is comforting sadly. He is someone that deserves better and if I do anything bad he will probably leave me. I feel bad for him sometimes as he blindsided by the awful things that I have done.

He is obsessed with finding out the nutrition facts in every meal, and manages to squeeze in the topic of dieting or fasting into every conversation, related or not. He can certainly eat his fill, but it seems to go from long fasts to binging on dozens of ramen cups in one sitting. Also, he's always working out and trying to ""improve"" his body (trust me, his body could not improve.) Before Covid, we used to go on long hikes, and both before AND after the hike, he would spend an absurd amount of time in the gym. The other day I video-called him and went to get something (I was gone for like 15 seconds) and came back to him doing sit-ups in his chair. He's obsessed with working out.

ever since i can remember myself i’ve been chubby. i’m almost 18 now and i’m not content with how my body looks at all. i’ve had a negative relationship with food for the past 3 years that’s been developing without my conscious understanding due to little jabs my mother has been making my whole life here and there, like: “are you going to eat all that?” 
“don’t eat all of this”
“you should start working out” 
“if you eat all this you’ll start complaining about being fat again” and so on. 

this lead me to a point of hiding food under my shirt or in my pants or generally just out of her sight so i can go to my room and eat it. i got so paranoid i started hiding it from my dad as well in fear he’d tell her. for a good amount of time i couldn’t stop eating even though i wanted to. i’d feel disgusted and so so so guilty but i just couldn’t stop and as much as i hate to admit it, i still can’t. it gets a little complex though, cause i’ll have periods of time where i completely starve myself the entire day, eat nothing and lie to everyone about having eaten already but then there are periods of time where i’ll do the former.

i started working out today, and my family ordered pizza and spring rolls, which was really tempting considering my dad told me to come eat. i told him i didn’t want, thinking i’ll eat a salad later since i just worked out, but he insisted and i went downstairs but only ate some spring rolls. i felt so guilty. i was about to go take a shower (mind you, i’m emetophobic; i have an intense fear of vomiting, especially since last time i vomited i ended up fainting) and i thought about it. i was about to induce vomiting but my brother knocked on the door wanting to use the bathroom, and i snapped out of it. i was literally shaking. i didn’t get to vomit but i’m so so so scared i’ll end up trying it again. in fact, i know i will. my intrusive thoughts won’t leave me alone right now and i don’t know if i trust myself to be alone. i probably sound crazy. i don’t know why i’m writing this, i guess i don’t know who to turn to.",,"developing an eating disorder, i think.",5,,trigger warning,,,,t5_2zzq8,m5jmoi,1,apetite-for-chaos,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/m5jmoi/developing_an_eating_disorder_i_think/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/m5jmoi/developing_an_eating_disorder_i_think/,1615811383,408,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments about weight from mother, hiding food, periods of bingeing and starving, fear of vomiting, intrusive thoughts",harmful,"Development of negative relationship with food due to mother’s comments, Hiding food and feeling paranoid about eating, Bingeing and starving periods, Fear of vomiting leading to thoughts of inducing vomiting, Intrusive thoughts causing fear and anxiety",Negative comments from mother about weight and food,harmful,"Developed a negative relationship with food and their body, Paranoia and hiding food from family members, Periods of binge eating and periods of starving themselves, Intense fear of vomiting and thoughts of inducing vomiting after eating","Negative comments about body and food from mother, hiding food, periods of overeating and starvation, fear of vomiting, intrusive thoughts",harmful,"Developed a negative relationship with food due to mother’s comments, Hides food from family and feels guilty about eating, Experiences periods of overeating and starvation, Fear of vomiting and intrusive thoughts lead to desire to induce vomiting, Brother interrupts and prevents vomiting"

I didn't eat or drink during that so I lost hella weight. After that, I restricted when ever I wanted to rapidly lose weight (for a party or something). I thought I have it under control. When I'm not restricting, I'd eat normally but feel internally guilty about it or I'd be thinking 'I shouldn't be eating this, put it down'. It went on like this for a while. Restricting for a few days and then eating for a few but feeling shame that I did. But recently, I was eating and I choked and that caused me to throw up. Afterwards, I felt immense relief. Like I was glad that I threw up because it stopped me eating. Now, I'm getting into a habit of restricting often and purging any big meal I eat.

950,eating_disorders,"When I was younger indulge I'm food, practically eat everything in sight and just eat and eat. 

Then I went to secondary school. I used to skip breakfast and lunch and then just eat everything at home. Is that a pack of crisps? Guess I'm going to have to eat the whole 150g bag! This was a constant repeated cycle until the weekend where I used to eat as much as I wanted and then I would go to school and, well it would happen again and again. I would eat all my junk in secret because I felt ashamed by it.

When  the coronavirus came, and we had to stay inside, i used to eat tons of junk food and eat lots of snacks out of boredom. I used to feel so bad about myself and then I'd eat more out of sadness.

Then I was allowed to go back to school, and I started to skip breakfast and eat lunch at school and eat whatever I wanted to at home. I really didn't want to eat lunch but only did because my mum was worried about me not eating breakfast or lunch.

Then, we have our current lockdown (from January to now). I started counting calories in January but only did it for less than a week because i started to become scared when i thought i had eaten too many calories.  Then in February, I started to intermittent fast (16:8) and it has been going pretty well! Since the end of February, I started to eat less and less, and I practically don't feel very hungry.  i only eat one actual meal a day(to break my fast). I constantly tell myself that I don't need to eat even when I know I should. I've recently started to count my calories again just to watch what I eat and I want to lose some weight and I realise I don't even eat my BMR!!

I'm a little worried about this and it would be really helpful to get some insight.



Additional info: 
-My mum tells me that I've been losing a lot of weight (since July of last year) but I just don't see it. She thinks I might have body dysmorphia became of this.
When checked my weight on the scale in December, I actually had put on 2KG so I decided to exercise more.

- I've recently begun to have irregular sleeps. Normally I'd sleep 8.5 hrs or how ever long I wanted to sleep, but now I go bed at roughly 11:30pm and wake up at 6:30-7:00 am. I feel so tired all times of the day.

- I am constantly thinking about my weight, and what to eat or if I should go on more walks to burn a lot more calories. 

- since Christmas, I've lost 3 inches off my waist and 4 off of my thighs. I've lost more inches around my arms and legs.

I am now currently 15yrs old, 5'3, and 70kg (last time I checked was February 26th)

But the more time I spend with her, the more I notice her behavior around food. She seems to avoid eating entirely (maybe one meal a day, occasionally two if she really has to, like being at dinner with someone) and when she does, she doesn't seem like she's enjoying it at all. 
 I know in the past that one of our friends has tried bringing it up. She opened up about how she doesn't really like eating more than one meal a day, and our mutual friend tried voicing their concern. 
In this scenario I want to note that it was in a way that felt pretty unhelpful. They said her way of eating was really unhealthy and she needed to eat more than one meal a day. She instantly got defensive, saying things like she knew they were going to react this way and that's why she never talked about it. I stayed out of the conversation entirely. I don't really know that much about disordered eating behaviors, but I've been to therapy for a few years now.

960,eating_disorders,"Long rant so apologies in advance. I am 25 years old and live with my mom.(times are tough). Anyway, I do want to lose weight but my mother seems to project unhealthy behaviors onto me. She says I need to count every single calorie like if I add a tablespoon of mustard or ketchup to a Hot Dog or something like that. 

She also feels the need to tell me how many calories are in a meal that either her or I are going to eat. And raves about how low in calories something she has is in. She also tells me her future meals and how little calories they’re going to have in them.

This behavior has been going on since my childhood. With questions like “okay if you realllyyyy want to eat that?” Or “are you sure you want to eat that?” And comments like “she’s a vacuum shell eat everything” and stuff like “you just ate” and “you’re going to eat all that?!” Or “i can’t believe you just ate all that!” She has told me to drink more water and to drink before a meal to not as much. 

It makes me super self conscious especially eating in public. I feel like people secretly judge me while eating because of these comments in the past. She also keeps pressuring me into telling her my weight. “How much do you weight? Do you weigh this much? Just tell me” I just feel like it’s something me and my doctor need to know. I don’t need to make my weight public.

At 13 I started starving myself with 600 calories a day and lost a ton of weight. I didn’t think of it as a disorder but as a “crash diet”. It did come back on tho (and quickly) but I used to think it was normal and that’s what crash dieting was. My mom didn’t even seem to notice even though I was pretty open about starving myself. She just seemed content with me losing weight. I even think I brought it up to her at one point but she just shrugged it off and said it’s your body I can’t force you to do anything. 

Part of me thinks I messed up my metabolism as a teenager and now I can’t lose any weight because of it. I am thinking of seeing a dietician when I am able to work again. 

As a child, my mom always pointed out bigger women and ask me “am I as fat as her?” “Look at that lady! Do I look that fat?” Now as an adult, I feel compelled to compare myself to other people.

I decided to stop eating breakfast at the beginning of the school year and later tried to avoid eating on the weekends (I eat school lunches and my friends ask questions when I’m not at lunch). The past few weeks though I’ve been eating less and less. From eating just my lunch at school (often getting seconds), to trying to eat very little to nothing at lunch everyday. I try to avoid food at home unless it’s fruit or something healthy. Anyways the point I’m trying to get to is that in gym class a little less than half way through the class I get light headed and feel weak. Feeling like I could pass out. Have I developed and eating disorder? Is this lightheadedness most likely cause by my not eating much? If someone could help me out here that would be nice.

979,eating_disorders,"Hello! I am 16, and when I was 5 years old, I was first exposed to fast food from my parents when they decided for some reason to order me a happy meal. It was very tasty that I would get mad and even yell at my parents for not taking me to McDonald's. Once I turned 6 years old, my doctors considered me overweight. Once I was 8 years old, my doctor then said that I was almost obese. That's then when my parents limited how much junk food that I could eat and drink. It was working quite well for many years until last February, I was 15, and I was watching lots of TV shows such as my 600 pound life. Once I finished watching a few episodes in one day, I then became extremely concerned about what I have been eating. I also now found out that if I can't stop eating junk, I would turn myself into someone I would very soon regret. In the next day, I refused to eat breakfast and only ate an apple for dinner. As time went on, I refused to eat all restaurant and fast food, chips, most pastas, drink sodas, processed meats, fried foods, and all other junk foods and instead have now been eating fruits, bread, eggs, nuts, whole grain cereal, drinking fat free and low fat milk, water, and grilled chicken that my dad cooks on his grill. I was at one point eating only one small meal a day at dinner very often that my parents threatened me that they would discipline me if I didn't have at least two meals a day. Although I am glad that I was able to quit my restaurant and fast food eating addiction after 10 years of trying, For almost a year now, I have been eating 2 small meals a day only eating the healthy foods now and not having a snack or a meal in between. My doctor has recently been concerned about my weight, but I told her not to be because my gut was still bulging out a bit, but she said the reason for that is because I don't do enough physical activity, even though I take many steps a day, so I don't believe her. I never feel weak or tired, but my parents say that I need to eat more or else they will send me to the hospital. Should I take their words for it?

980,eating_disorders,"Hey! I [F20] really started worrying about my weight about a year ago. I've always had these phases of either not caring at all what I eat where I would most days eat over my daily caloric recommendation or then, count every calorie I eat and make sure to eat just right. Normally these phases last a few months and then switch to the other one.

However, I have now been stuck on the calorie counting phase. I eat super unhealthy but I still somehow manage to stay under the calorie recommendation. I am totally normal weight but I get veeeery anxious if I don't know how many calories some food has and often insist on making my own foods because of it. I also try to 'save' my calories for the nights so that I can binge which means that I'm eating max 800 calories during the day and in the evening, 1000 cals in one sitting. 

I also feel that my body image changes daily, after eating I have to check my body to see if it feels any different, and I also need to weigh myself daily (sometimes multiple times a day) to be sure that I haven't put on weight. I'm on the 'lower' side of normal weight but would still love to be a few kilograms lighter.

981,eating_disorders,"For the past few months my eating habits have drastically changed. I’d say i first noticed maybe four months ago but I’m sure this has been going on for longer than that, maybe just more subtly. I’ve always been pretty healthy (as healthy as someone who smokes and vapes a lot can be... trust me I know, I’m trying to quit) I’ve never had a problem with my eating habits until now. I loved eating. Like, LOVED eating. Even if I wasn’t particularly hungry, if food was offered to me, I’d take it. I wasn’t overweight but i wasn’t skinny either... I was healthy. Then something changed. One day I woke up and I realized that I just didn’t want to eat. I’d feed hungry but when I got up to get food, the sight of it would turn me off. I know it’s weird but this new pattern comes in intervals of some sort. I’ll go two or three weeks of eating half a meal a day and then for a week I’ll be back to eating normally and the cycle repeats. I was never a big cook (I’m 18 and still live with my family, my grandma does most of the cooking) but I thought that maybe making food would trigger the hunger or something. Didn’t work. I’ve lost a lot of weight in these past few months. I work in a restaurant and due to COVID restrictions I wasn’t working from mid November to January and I guess within that time frame I’ve lost a considerable amount of weight. So much so that nearly all of my coworkers commented on it when I first went back. I also deal with comments on the daily from my family about how I’ve lost too much weight and I barely eat which gets EXHAUSTING. When I DO eat I find that its later in the day, usually at night. The thing is I don’t feel any sort of shame towards my body or anything like that. I do have insecurities and things I’d like to change but so does everyone. At the end of the day I’m quite happy with my body and strangely enough I was starting to become way more confident in my body before all this started happening, and I still am... And from what I’ve read on the internet my experiences don’t really fit in with any eating disorders. I thought it might be anorexia at first (based on a very limited understanding of ed’s) but after minimal research I don’t think that’s what it is. And i know it’s not bulimia. Is it some form of a binge eating disorder? I also suffer from depression and anxiety as well as ADHD. Covid has only worsened my depression.

982,eating_disorders,"So I’ve been overweight/obese pretty much my whole life. I’ve always been a binge eater and emotional eater. I just love food. 
A few months ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and it changed everything. We caught it quite early so I don’t need to take medication or insulin so it is completely controlled by my diet.

As soon as I got my diagnosis, I immediately started the Keto diet as I heard that it was good for diabetics. I also cut my calories down to 1800 a day. After a while, though, I felt like if I got too close to my limit I was eating too much. Now, I beat myself up if I get to/over 1000. I’ll stay in bed as long as I can in the morning because I know as soon as I get out I’ll want to eat and I want to give myself as little time to eat as I can. 

My blood sugar levels now are that of a non diabetic and I’m proud of that but now my focus has shifted to my weight. My partner tells me how noticeably smaller I am but I can’t see it.
I know that I have lost some weight but it doesn’t feel like enough. My partner is getting frustrated with me because I beat myself up so much over it. I’m worried that no matter how much I lose, it will never be enough and I’ll still be afraid to eat. 

It’s not that I hate food now, I still want it all the time. I’m just terrified to eat any what I call “no-no foods”. I feel happier when I eat 700 calories a day then when I eat 1800. I know a banana won’t kill me, but I’m still afraid of it. I know I won’t gain back all the weight I lost if I eat a sandwich once, but the thought of having one makes me genuinely scared.

I feel like because of my weight and how it’s only been a few months, I can’t classify this as an eating disorder. While my partner has expressed genuine concern about my current eating habits, my mother has praised me for it and even seemed surprised that I haven’t lost more weight. I feel like overweight people aren’t taken seriously when they under eat because that’s what we “should be” doing.

989,eating_disorders,"(*i don’t know what subreddit to write this in so i’m saying it here since this topic is related to food restriction and may be related to an eating disorder.) this has been going on for the past several months and it’s really bothering me. my twin sister (we’re teens but i don’t want to state our exact age) writes down everything i eat on her phone. every. single. thing. and she even counts the calories. 

we’re fraternal twins, and i’ve always been the “skinnier/smaller” one ever since we were really young. no one’s really ever pointed it out or said anything about our weight, but it was visibly obvious. also, i’ve always been a little shorter and had a smaller appetite, so my mom would constantly nag me to eat more. we’ve never had any issues regarding our weight and diet until now. 

i’m guessing that recently, something incentivized her to suddenly want to lose weight. but her method is so strange? she keeps track of what i eat and how much I eat everyday, and uses that as a gauge for what and how much SHE should eat. i know that it’s something that’s pretty normal among siblings, comparing everything, but this is just messed up. 

my mom has been made aware of it before and she had a talk with my sister about it, at the end of which she said she would no longer do this. however, earlier today i caught my sister STILL writing down what i eat on her phone. 

not only is this unhealthy for her (bc she naturally has a bigger appetite and she’s suddenly restricting so much), it’s also stressful for me to know that someone is tracking what i eat and how many calories i consume every time i eat. 

it bothers me so much, but i don’t know how to stop her from doing it. i’m the only one who knows about this other than my mom, but she thinks my sister stopped. what should i do? can someone please tell me how i can stop her from doing this?",,i found out my sister is secretly keeping track of everything i eat,32,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,lm0fpe,1,tiphannie,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/lm0fpe/i_found_out_my_sister_is_secretly_keeping_track/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/lm0fpe/i_found_out_my_sister_is_secretly_keeping_track/,1613584715,351,0,0,0,-1,1,Sister tracking what the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causing stress and discomfort for the writer, Unhealthy for the sister who is restricting her food intake",Sister tracking what the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causes stress and discomfort for the writer, Potentially encourages unhealthy eating habits and restriction for the sister",Twin sister keeping track of everything the writer eats and counting calories,harmful,"Causing stress and discomfort for the writer, Unhealthy for the sister who is restricting despite having a bigger appetite"

Today is the day I'm starting the fight. I've done it before. I can do it now. 

Step 1. Allowing myself to eat as much fruit and veg as I want. 

This sounds small. But for the past 3 months I have severely limited my intake of everything, that this is actually a huge step forward. 

Today I allowed myself a larger portion of cabbage and some beetroot, compared to what I have been doing.

The pain of hunger is easily ignored and I won't eat mostly because i'm lazy. I can compare it to not choosing to eat because it's just bothersome similar to if I don't want to clean my room or do the dishes. Over the years I've had social issues with this as my friends are annoyed that I don't enjoy food like they do, when we go out I only eat for the social situation. I just never ""got it"" why people go crazy over eating food. I used to be skinny but over the years I have forced myself to constantly eat on a set time to get my weight up. Sometimes it drives me nuts that I have to eat so much all the time as I also have a love for the gym and focus on building size. I've always stayed very lean even when bulking. It would be nice to be able to a name to my situation. Whenever I look this up it always comes up as anorexia but I disagree as I don't have any body image issue with gaining weight and in fact i'm very happy with the way I look.

993,eating_disorders,"When I was younger from about the age of 10-18, I struggled with disordered eating. I was never officially diagnosed because my mother either didn’t care (most likely) or was too ashamed to have a “broken” daughter to actually do anything about it, but I had all of the classic signs and at my lowest weighed about 78lbs at 5’2. I recovered on my own shortly after graduating high school and moving out (away from my mother). Fast forward to the present, I’m 25 and just had my second daughter a month and a half ago. This was my 3rd pregnancy after losing a baby last February. This pregnancy was not kind to my body. I feel like I have whole map of Texas on my ass and I am definitely the highest weight I’ve ever been (aside from during pregnancy) at 146. I feel like an absolute whale. I was about 125 and happy before I got pregnant. But now that it’s time to start losing the baby weight, I genuinely don’t know if I can do it in a healthy manner. I’ve started tracking my food and exercise again to keep myself on track with healthy foods, but seeing low calorie counts at the end of the day brings up so many old feelings that it’s hard not to fall into old habits.

994,eating_disorders,"When participating in a FaceBook ED support group, I was privately contacted by a TV producer looking for ""severe"" eating disorder cases to be treated on a TV show. My first thought was of course that this was a scam but I looked at her profile and it seemed consistent, she had many LA area acting-related jobs on her profile and had genuine friends that she was interacting with. I googled her and also found a very well backed-up LinkedIn account. She gave me her phone number with an LA area code and everything. So the point being it seems legit.

It is my ultimate career goal to someday become an actor so wanting to jump on the chance to get my first-ever appearance on TV I said yes and set up a phone consultation with her. Now thinking about it more, I'm quite anxiety stricken about the whole thing and have a lot of concerns.

Firstly, they are looking for ""severe"" cases which in itself is problematic. I am underweight but not to an extreme point, I fear that this will actually push me down further in the name of looking valid on TV and staying on the show. They said they are looking to produce a show that is the opposite of my 600 lb life which kind of automatically implies they expect their show guests to be pretty underweight since that's what the opposite of 600 lbs would be. Literally, as soon as I said yes, I regretted eating as much as I did that day. 

I'm also very stressed because it's a lot of pressure to be under for someone already experiencing something so difficult, to begin with. I don't mind sharing my story in itself but I don't know how I would actually feel having cameras in my face during live emotional moments. Basically, the idea is you get ""top"" treatment by well-accredited eating disorder professionals in exchange for having it all filmed. I do really need the treatment because I can't fund it myself so I've been left years without and have been progressively getting worse as a result. However, being as introverted as I am, being filmed all the time would be such a culture shock.

This has honestly given me a lot of respect for people who go on these emotional reality shows, just setting up a consultation for the chance to be on one has given me so much stress already.

I'm considering canceling the consult but it would be a really great opportunity to get on TV for the first time ever and I don't know when I'll get that again. It's not every day that a LA TV producer wants to interview you for a show. I plan to go to college for a Theater degree which I hope land me some TV spots but I won't be in college for years still.

Today I didn’t work out, and decided it’s rest day. Me and my mom made vegan chocolate covered strawberries and banana slices. I had 2 strawberries and 2 banana mini slices (like quarter sized) and I don’t feel guilty at all. 

I also am shocked that when I looked in the mirror today since I have OCD with mirrors and body checking, that I actually didn’t mind the way my body looked. I notice a nice change in my thighs, I feel stronger and not as mushy. I don’t think I’m losing weight but I’m getting more muscle which is making me feel smaller.

I write because, I doubt my restrictive eating is developing into an eating disorder.
I have so far only lost 2 kg within the last month / 3 weeks.
but I can feel that I have had a hard time eating food I have not made myself. I can almost panic if I can not get the food I want. my mood is constantly changing. I train to be able to eat later.
I bought low-calorie food and yesterday I was almost starting to cry because someone in my family had eaten it.
I currently have a BMI at 20.5 and do not look sick. I'm in doubt if this is bad though?

I know I'll have to drink alcohol tomorrow and my friends have told me we’ll have toasts for lunch. I've been thinking about it all week ... and I can actually not be in it. for I know how unhealthy both are and I think it is extremely difficult. I get very uncomfortable if people talk or comment on my food when I eat.

however, it must be said that I eat. I track all my food well enough, and should preferably be in a calorie deficit of 1000 kcal. so depending on how much I exercise, I eat about 1200-1600 kcal a day. and that's actually ok a lot. so I am able to eat, I just need to be able to decide for myself what it is because I need to know what is in my food.

1000,eating_disorders,"So this is quite a long question.

I am a 20F and I’m 5ft. I haven’t weighed myself lately, but I have been about the same weight for as long as I can remember - 7st (44/45kg or 98lbs). BMI testing done by myself, my family and my doctors have always put me as right at the bottom of healthy weight, but I know BMI is not the most accurate measurement.

The way that I eat is definitely not typical, but I don’t know that I would be considered to have an eating disorder. I rarely feel hungry, I often skip meals, I would much rather snack on junk food than actually cook something to eat. I don’t normally try to skip meals, I just get busy with life and then realise it 8pm and I haven’t eaten since breakfast.

I also hate eating meals. I find it boring. I’m quite a slow eater and I’d rather be spending the time doing anything else. This ties into the above, I’m not hungry, so why would I want to spend time eating.

I’m not trying to lose weight, if anything I’d like to gain some, and I don’t think I’m fat. I don’t make myself sick or anything like that. I just have absolutely no desire to eat anything.

I’ve never gotten any help from anyone to eat better and gain weight because I’ve always been considered “healthy”. My mum brought it up to doctors many times when I was younger, and I’ve brought it up a couple times but I always get the same response. I’m not underweight so they can’t do anything for me.

If anyone can let me know what they think, that would be great. I’d also appreciate any tips on how to improve my eating habits and gain weight if anyone’s had anything similar.

1003,eating_disorders,"Hi, I'm a senior in highschool and have been dealing with an ED (eating disorder) for quite a while now. I want to get help and I've tried to look for counselors &amp; therapists for a long time but since I'm underaged I would have to tell my parents who don't know about my ED, and I'm just not ready for them to know. I know that this might sound dumb but my main issue with my ED is that I either overeat or don't eat at all. I did notice that over quarantine my eating habits did begin to resolve however ever since I've returned to school my eating habits have gone back to how they used to be. Some days I'll eat a lot to the point where I feel discomfort while other days I'll eat close to nothing. Whenever I overeat the next day I make sure to workout ""extra hard"" in order to burn the extra calories. When I don't over eat I stick to my regular workout regimen. I want for others to give me advice on how I could improve my eating habits and how to find a middle ground. 

I'm going to tell you how a normal day would look over quarantine when my ED was beginning to look better. I would wakeup stretch and do a 10 low impact workout to get my body ready for online school. I would make sure to drink at least 1 water bottle before having breakfast. I would eat breakfast at around 9-10a.m. then at around 12 I would do a 10min HIIT workout because it helped me to regain focus before going back 2 online classes. I would then eat lunch at around 2:30-3p.m. After that I wouldn't eat dinner or anything else after lunch because I still wasn't ready/comfortable. At around 5 then I would do a 30 min workout so I would do 10min of cardio and 20min of abs. for the rest of the day I would relax or finish school work.

What a normal day looks for me after returning to school: I wake up do a 10min HIIT workout and a 10min ab workout, whenever I felt like I ate too much the day before I would make sure to do an extra ab workout. I don't eat breakfast and don't bring food to school because I feel like if I did when I return home I won't be able to control myself. At around 2:40p.m when I got back from school I always eat lunch. At around 5p.m I do a cardio workout and abs workout for 30min if I'm feeling energetic I'll do extra or when If I feel like if I overate the day before I'll do extra.

1004,eating_disorders,"Throwaway for this. I dont know if I have an eating disorder. My parents are worried that I do because they dont think I eat enough, i think I'm fine, but i dont know if I'm in denial or what. I like to think I'm fairly self-aware, but i dont know.

Over the last week or so I've been eating very little, almost nothing except dinner. Whenever I eat dinner I immediately feel completely stuffed, even if it wasnt that much. This never used to happen but now I feel like I'm going to get sick whenever I eat. The last three days I've been vomiting some of my dinner up. But it's only because I feel too full, and i dont vomit _that much_ its just a little off the top so that I dont feel stuffed anymore. 

Whenever I eat I feel nauseous and its difficult to chew because of that. I find myself shaking all the time, and I'm cold quite often even when its warm.

The reason I have a lot of doubt about this, is that I dont really have a terrible weight image. I used to when I was younger, I was very very obsessed with how fat I looked. I dont think I'm that fat anymore, just a little bit of a belly and it doesnt show up under a hoodie.

I do have body image issues, but they're not weight, it's mostly gender dysphoria. It's very bad, but I dont think weight or anything is that big of a factor in it.

I'm just really confused. I dont think this is that unhealthy but I dunno. I dont even vomit up all of my dinner just a bit off the top.

I'm posting cause I just dont know about any of this and I'm looking for help as to whether this is normal or if my parents are right and theres a problem here. (They dont know I've been vomiting).

im just sad. It's sad to think how proud i was of being that itty bitty (107lbs),, ofc my eating habits were very poor and the world was actually running, so I had places to be and had school which involved exercise (i dance for school productions), but then i got really really low. Like it was very very bad, I remember that summer while i was flaunting my skinny/toned bod i wasnt eating nearly enough and it got so bad that i had horrible headaches and the shakes and they wouldnt go away unless i ate or drank water. I mostly survived off dunkin donuts iced coffee and acai bowls (the only food i would eat bc it was full of antioxidants and that sounded pretty good for a bowl full of natures candy), but then I went to the mental hospital (i was there for 6 days) and it was surprisingly easy to skip meals because everyday they had some sort of meat that I didn't eat (I don't eat red meat) so i would pick up one or two things that I knew would be appetizing--- IM ALSO SUCH A PICKY EATER!!!!!!! that should be noted bc it makes sense why i was so selective with my food.

1016,eating_disorders,"Hi,

Not sure where else to go / vent so here seemed the best place. I have PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome) which is a very common hormonal disorder among women. Among symptoms like acne, depression, hair loss, facial hair.... weight gain (despite being in a calorie deficit), and infertility are key symptoms. 

I have struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. I used to be overweight, then changed my diet, and am now a 'normal' weight (not skinny, still have some fat rolls, but not overweight). I hate my body, all I see is fat. Despite exercising 5 days a week, eating rediculously healthy (I do eat a 'normal' amount, Id say I eat about 1,550 cal a day, and 3 meals &amp; a snack), I cannot loose weight- which is all part of my condition (inability to loose weight is very common due to messed up hormones). As a result, my relationship with food is bad &amp; getting worse. I know that having a list of 'good' and 'bad' foods is typical of eating disorders, for example not allowing bread, sweets, ect, but my problem is that with PCOS, it is \*proven\* that consuming refined carbs (white bread, white pasta, sugar, ect) worsens the condition, so it seems reasonable to have a list of 'off limit' or 'once in a blue moon' foods (remembering infertility is a side effect of PCOS so this plays on my mind a LOT).  How can I possibly have a good relationship with food when anything nice is bad for me... caffeine? nope because I have adrenal problems. Sugar? Worst thing for me, as I'm insulin resistant. Dairy? Spikes insulin levels. Carbs? A low carb diet is the best option for insulin resistant PCOS... I do all this, and I am still chunky, and miserable. my friends eat what they want/ start to eat a little healthier and get abs/ loose weight and keep it off. I am sick of having this. I feel so so alone. I can't eat chocolate without feeling guilt, even when I eat an apple I feel guilt as its sugar. I can see this is a slippery slope to a very bad relationship with food and I don't know what to do...

&amp;#x200B;

Should I restrict even more to get to my ideal weight then stop? Or should I just eat what I want in moderation, accept my body &amp; hope that I will be happy like this? For anyone with a relationship with food similar to mine, when you got a better relationship were you happier?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm dealing with binge eating. I'm autistic and obese, I'm also on antipsychotics. My diet is extremely strict and picky, so I assume this is my autism.

I consume about 2000 to 3000 calories with every fast food meal I have usually once a day, the next 2 times I eat something I maybe only eat 700-800 calories. 

when I order fast food, I eat till I am in a food coma, because it feels so good mentally but I often regret eating that much because I end up vomiting, often self induced but I don't have a choice because of nausea.

My fast food of choice is the local kebab store, dominos and McDonald's with KFC.

I don't experience any shame or guilt when I eat. 

The only thing I've been eating daily is fast food for the last 8 to 9 months, it's always on my mind and when I attempt to eat something healthy I feel sad and depressed because I miss my ""friend"", my best friend being my McDonald's and KFC or other fast food item.

1022,eating_disorders,I am sixteen and have been struggling with eating disorders for the previous two years or so.  I struggle with bingeing and purging  however my purging is through laxatives and excessive exercise  as well as fasting after binges to try to compensate for all the binge calories.  I also am struggling with restricting when I am able to go a couple days with no bingeing after my fasting compensation is done.  I am struggling so much everyday  and me continuously obsessing over calories and eating is negatively affecting my ability to complete my class assignments  and ruining my relationships with my family members and friends.  Eating stresses me  due to how much time I am wasting with tracking every calorie and obssessing over ensuring I am staying below my daily maximum.  Despite this  I am still bingeing every two or three days on average  which leads me to purge  then begin restricting again.  I have nobody who I can discuss this with  and my parents have no clue  so I am unable to begin getting help or getting into counseling.  This binge eating and obssessing over calories has been causing me to have depression  and I am really struggling.  Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can begin recovering?  I realize the beginning step is to stop bingeing which will allow me to stop purging.

I'm an ftm trans guy who is almost 2 years on T (4 more months!). I'm also someone who has had an eating disorder in the past. I've been recovering from it for about 10 months and it's been kind of alright, no relapses, just occasional bad thoughts. however lately these thoughts have been really bad. I'm really self conscious of my thighs and hips since, despite them actually being a normal size, i see them as huge and very womanly. I'm also afraid of my chest size. because of my recovery, I've gained more weight than before, which is fine, it's ok, i don't really care about weight but I care about things like my chest size and legs. i looks for advice but since there are not many articles or people sharing their experiences with ed's who are trans men, i never find the help I need. instead, i find things that trigger me more like people saying ""you should eat! you'll get a bigger butt and bigger b**bs!"" which is exactly what I DON'T want. but because of my increased dysphoria, my dysmorphia has been off the rocks lately. now, I'm not just self-conscious of my legs and chest, but my face and stomach. these thoughts saying i should work out and stop eating keep me up at night and takes my focus off of my work. it's driving me insane since I've been doing so well for such a long time and I don't want to relapse and lie to myself saying that ""I'm not hurting"" or ""just a little diet."" i want to not have bigger legs so i want to work out and eat less and healthier but i know for a fact that it will only make these thoughts louder. i want to go on walks just for my overall mental health but I know that I will most likely think about how I should make this another 30 minutes longer so I can work out a little more. it's driving me insane and i don't know what to do. i just don't know what to do. if anyone has any advice i would greatly appreciate.

1032,eating_disorders,"I don’t know how the hell I managed to do this so quickly but after about a week of fasting with small window &amp; eating one meal a day while restricting calories to below my TDEE... I have freaking ruined food. And myself! 

I love cooking, there’s so much great cooks chowing off their recipes in my Reddit feed and I can’t enjoy it anymore. I see the oil, bread, pasta, whatever (typical fear foods) and have to keep scrolling. I get nauseous looking at it now. Matter of fact I get nauseous every meal now.

I have been lifting as heavy as I can for the past year or more and today was a lift day. My lifts were terrible since I started restricting again because I have no energy and recovery is harder. All this is obvious so last night I let myself eat a little more in hopes of getting more protein to help me today. When you’re lifting you want to have 1g of protein per lb you weigh essentially to promote muscle growth. I have been falling short on protein. Today I make sure to get a good amount in each meal (I had more than one!) and each time feeling full got me so sick. 

Breakfast was relatively small but I wanted fuel for my lifts. Lunch was a double scoop of protein mix to help with recovery. Dinner was meat and veggie stir fry and I couldn’t finish it.

I thought about this dinner since last night, I was so excited to try to recreate the Panda Express super greens as a side! My husband lifted today so it would be a great meal for both of us to hit our goals.... but I couldn’t finish it!! Calories were no problem! I could have had seconds and still be within my goals. BUT the feeling of being full was grossing me out.

I had issues as a teen but I am 31 years old now. I have no idea why but something clicked about 2 weeks ago and I’ve been slowly cutting back on what I eat without being hungry at all... just more tired and less motivated to work out.

I want to be healthy! I have been working at being healthy the last 3 years! My labs are amazing! I’m a little over weight but my doctors never brought it up as a concern. I know exactly what I need to do to stay on a good path but I am addicted to seeing the scale going down. It hasn’t gone down in so long.

The worst part is besides this I am the happiest I’ve been I think... ever! My marriage is amazing right now, which means more to me than most of the other stuff. Work is shut down because of covid but I think I’m okay with it. Family is... fine because my side of the family is on the other side of the country. I always used my ED as a way to control my fucked up home life but now my home life is good and suddenly I’m broken again.

I don’t really know how to end this I just needed to vent. Boy to I miss livejournal for just this type of anonymous venting. 

I hope I didn’t trigger anyone because it was hard to explain what I’m feeling and going through without numbers. I’m sorry if I gave too many details.

1039,eating_disorders,"So I’m not even sure if it’s really an eating disorder or binge eating but I’ve started to notice a pattern. Always been a bigger girl (not huge but I’ve never felt or been skinny by any means). I keep trying to get healthier because I can see myself gaining weight and I just want to be a healthier person in general. Like many people I try to lose weight, it doesn’t last and I start eating again. What is starting to worry me is there seems to be some kind of trigger. When I try to lose weight I no longer try to restrict myself, I eat what I want in moderation. I don’t weigh myself daily anymore but I’ve noticed I’ll do really well, I’ll be enjoying myself and feel so much better then as soon as I see I’ve made any real progress I completely regress. 
For example, for 6 weeks I was doing really well. Gym 3 or 4 times a week (and I loved it) and was eating what I want but on a much healthier scale (smaller portions, not buying silly things I didn’t really want like big bars of chocolate). Then I saw that I had made it down to a weight that I would describe as “the bottom of my yo-yo”, like I can never make it below that weight because I start eating badly again. As soon as I saw that weight I was so proud and happy that I had done that and didn’t even feel like I was on some strict diet. Then for the next two weeks I completely regressed, stopped exercising, got really sad and stayed at home, started eating and eating (4 or 5 meals plus snacks, whole bars of chocolate and tubs of Pringles in one sitting). And I can’t understand it. When I’m not eating well or anything I don’t even eat that badly. It’s like seeing myself make progress triggers me to go the complete opposite way to reverse the progress. 
I’m sorry I’ve been rambling, I’ve just never spoken to anyone about it.

I’m healthy weight, but I still have a hard time wearing tight dresses, shirts, sweaters, and leggings. I can wear tight jeans (although sweatpants/baggy pants are my daily go to). Everyday I still wear baggy clothing and I thought it was a style I liked, but I'm suddenly doubting that.

I just realized today that maybe I don’t feel comfortable wearing tight clothes because of lingering thoughts and beliefs from my ED past. I tried putting on a non-baggy sweater and I immediately took it off because I thought I looked ridiculous. This is really frustrating for me because I thought my body image was improving and now I’m not so sure. Even though I’m mostly happy with my body and weight, I CANNOT bring myself to wear anything remotely tight or form fitting. I'd like to wear more of the clothes that I have and show off my body more. I’ve learned that I can’t do fad diets because of my history with restricting, is this something else that I have to learn to live with? Has anyone else had this problems years after recovering? Am I not actually recovered because of this? If anyone has had similar experiences in recovery I'd love to hear because I'm trying to make sense of how to deal with this.

1048,eating_disorders,"TW// Mentions suicide and binging and purging

*I just want to preface this by saying that I am currently seeking out help for my eating disorder. I have been struggling with bulimia for 10 years and only just started speaking to a therapist this year. She is not educated in eating disorders, but we are in the process of seeking out a specialist who can help me get on the road to recovery. Please don’t tell me to discontinue my eating disorder behaviours, as sadly that is not possible right now.*

In May 2020, I had a severe bulimia relapse. I went from binging and purging once a week max, to binging and purging 1-3 times a day. I know this is horrible, but unfortunately it has been the only way I could cope since surviving a suicide attempt this summer. I do see a therapist once a week but am still struggling with daily suicidal thoughts, and my eating disorder is the only thing that eases the pain temporarily. 

I noticed my hair starting to fall out in July, but didn’t think much of it. I have always had extremely thick hair ever since I was a child so I wasn’t too worried. As the months went on, the hair loss became extreme. In the past 6 months, I have lost about 3/4 of my hair thickness. I take Centrum women’s multivitamins and biotin daily, but nothing seems to stop the shedding. I have also been using the same shampoo and conditioner for years now which has never caused hair loss. My hair is constantly shedding while dry especially if I touch it, and every time I wash my hair it comes out in huge clumps. Any time I comb my hair, huge chunks of hair get stuck to the wide tooth comb. The garbage can is just full of hair at all times.

Please, if anyone has any suggestions on supplements or vitamins I can take to help stop my hair loss, I would be so grateful. It’s getting to the point where I’m worried I’m going to have to buy a wig soon. My hair has always been the one and only thing I liked about my appearance, so having it all quite literally go down the drain in a matter of months is making me hate myself even more than I did before. I really appreciate any comments and suggestions you may have. Thank you in advance.",,My hair is falling out rapidly.

1049,eating_disorders,"It will be 20 years for me dealing this frustrating, awful, exhausting disease (bullemia). 
I can't look in the mirror and not cry, not be disgusted and angry at the way I look. I am type 1 diabetic and that does not help. My endocrinologist won't prescribe an insulin pump until i know longer have an eating disorder.
I know what I'm doing is dangerous, I know I could choke, potentially ruining my teeth, making my metabolism worse and yet the feeling after purging is almost like the rush I got when I used a super addictive upper  just so to loose weight for 5 months of my life before going to treatment. 
They said they would try and help with my EA but their main focus was the drug addiction. I went to treatment and moved to a new city. If I had gone back to my hometown i probably would have gone back to using as I knew where to get it, that one person would get it no questions asked. I had never touched hard drugs in my 34 years of life and was able to get my hands on it through someone who I thought cared for me. 
Rehab kept me away but I'm not over my addiction, I think about it every day of my life, not only from the weight loss but because I'm chasing the feelings that came along with it. It escalated quickly, and was doing what I have wanted for so long. I knew it was dangerous but started to become more comfortable in my body. 
I am 5ft 6 and haven't stepped on a scale for 20 years. My only goal is to be comfortable in body. I'm not when I look at myself. 
I watched a beautiful Instagram post by lizzo a few days ago, and was so proud of her and happy how comfortable she is in her beautiful body, as soon as look at myself I'm sad and disgusted. I would be so upset if anyone I knew suffered from this and want to help them but I feel so alone. 
I went to the 10 weeks pre inpatient program at a hospital here and was told my eating disorder needed to be more under control, that I needed to break some of the symptoms on my own before being accepted...how is this possible? If I could break my habits on my own I wouldn't need treatment. 
I had my first ever suicidal thought a few months ago. It terrified me and still does. I shared that with my doctor who wrote a letter to the mental health inpatient program here.
They called and said we can't take you because you refuse to take anti-depressants (because of my eating disorder) she said I needed to fix my eating disorder and then they could help.
 It's a viscous circle and I don't know what to do. I don't have benefits for a private rehab. I can't fix my eating disorder on my own and won't receive treatment for it and my mental health until I do. 
My partner and I have been together for 6 years. I can't have children until I beat this disorder. It breaks my heart.  I'm not 100% sure if I want kids but it's not even  an option at this point. 
My apologies for the rant. But if anyone here in Canada has any suggestions I would be so happy to hear. 
My sister and I had a huge talk tonight both of us in tears. She was googling ea support groups and found one locally on zoom that offers 6 appointments for support with ea. She said she would pay the $ 30.00 ( i can afford it) but she said she wanted to help me. This was the first time anyone in my immediate family has ever brought my ea up with me. My parents are uncomfortable and don't know what to say and I feel like they feel guilty even though it's not their fault at all. They are amazing people. But hearing my sister say was one of the most great feelings I've had about helping my ea from someone other the  myself.

1059,eating_disorders,"I haven’t gone back to disordered eating in a while. Everything was (kind of) ok and I could eat whatever without feeling guilty or bad and I could genuinely smile at myself in the mirror, liking who I was.

But my weight kept creeping up and up and up and with the lock-down I hit my highest weight ever and officially had overweight. So now I HAD to lose weight. The problem: I only know how to lose weight the unhealthy way. I did lose a significant amount of weight without severe calorie restriction and with reasonable exercise, I didn’t go overboard. 

But what did change was my mentality.
I suddenly started hating the way I looked again, although subjectively I must look better now than when I was overweight, I just started focusing more on it again. I started putting myself down again and I feel guilty for eating.

I still have enough mental power to not give in to my urges to really go self-destructive mode again, but it’s hard. One side of me WANTS to hate myself again, because once I so, I know the weight will come flying off. But another part of me keeps resisting, telling me to keep loving myself. But by loving myself, it’s super super hard to make any weight loss progress.

1060,eating_disorders,"I'm not formally diagnosed with an eating disorder. I have spoken to my psychiatrist and to a therapist about it, but I have so much other shit to deal with that I guess it got lost. I'm not here to look for a diagnosis, but maybe some sort of reality check that I'm potentially harming my daughter. She's almost 2 and will be referred to as DD. 

I gained 88 lbs when I was pregnant and lost 63 lbs since. I'm so unhappy with how much I weigh, I go days barely eating. Yesterday, I made it through the entire day with only 2 scallops in my system (thanks mom-in-law!). I smoked some weed after putting DD down for the night and managed to eat a little more. I haven't been sleeping well and obviously haven't had any energy. But this is basically what all my days look like. I'll eat a tiny thing during the day and then stuff my face thanks to munchies. 

When DD is in daycare, she eats super well. I'll have some dinner with her at night (sometimes its my only meal, sometimes if I've eaten during the day, I'll skip dinner).

DD has been home for a couple weeks thanks to my cities covid restrictions. I noticed She's been eating a lot less. Less snacks, less at meals. I never eat breakfast, she used to eat so well but now she barely eats half of it. She used to snack like crazy, and ask for snacks, but now I have to offer or she doesn't eat. 

Is this my doing? Is she not eating because she hardly sees me eating? I'm not comfortable being stoned around my daughter, so I only ever smoke when she's asleep for the night. How can I change my shitty habits? At least around my daughter. 

My family is completely mentally unstable, so I'm trying to break the generational cycle (alcoholism, drug abuse, long history of anxiety and depression, borderline personality disorder and probably a few others that have gone undiagnosed thanks to my own shitty parents avoiding all their problems instead of trying to get help). I guess its important to add that I am diagnosed with bpd, ptsd, anxiety and depression, the rest is my parents. She will never see me drinking or abusing drugs.

1063,eating_disorders,"My best friend is struggling openly with an eating disorder but I do not know how to help her. I’ve never had an ED, I’ve always been naturally skinny and eaten whatever I’ve wanted so I’ve been trying to research ED’s to better know how to help. 
I guess when she was younger she was heavier and she’s been thin since high school she’s 28 now. She is not skinny to a dangerous point at all. If you saw her in public you wouldn’t think she has an ED at all.
I had kind of started realizing she had an ED because she would constantly talk about how “fat” she was and I was so confused because she’s clearly not fat at all. She has an obsession with working out and is constantly counting her calories and weighing her food.
She went on this diet where she was only eating 300 calories a day and I told her that it sounded really unhealthy. She was a personal trainer for a little while and she told me that it was fine. I started realizing just how much she is constantly analyzing her body and complaining about how she looks, mix that together with the scary diets and I realized she had some kind of ED (in my opinion, I’m not a professional).

I kinda talked to her about it and she was like “oh yeah I for sure have an eating disorder”. Fast forward about 6 months to right now, and she told me she’s still only eating 300 calories a day and she feels so guilty if she eats more than that. She said she began purging again, which apparently she hasn’t done in years. She also said she gets light headed when standing up. She works out from home every day. Cardio, leg and butt workouts, etc.

Now again I know very little about this stuff so I apologize if I use the wrong terminology or get things incorrect, that’s why I’m here. The thing about her is that she doesn’t want to be super thin like a lot of the people suffering I’ve read about. She just has these obsessions with hitting these goal weights, idk it’s really hard to explain. 

Like she still wants to have a nice butt and muscle somewhat but also wants to continue to lose weight. I just don’t know how to help her. She feels comfortable telling me about it because I never judge her or tell her she needs immediate help, etc. she kinda told her boyfriend about it but he just says stuff like “omg you need to eat more! Order a burger!” Like he doesn’t get what’s really happening in her mind.

She thinks her eating disorder stems from a long history of childhood issues. Parents, being overweight at some point, sexual assault, etc. She’s also been trying to be an actress for years and has been in some movies and productions (she’s a great actress) but I feel like that adds to the pressure to be “attractive”. I think because her job is so hard she enjoys having control over her body if that makes sense.

1065,eating_disorders,"Hi all, this is my first post here.

I had been overweight for most of my childhood, and when I turned 15, I decided to stick to a plant based diet in order to lose weight. I ended up losing 50 pounds in less than a year, and I began to slip into a cycle of disordered eating. I would refuse to eat anything “unclean” and soon, I became very underweight. It caused a lot of issues with my family and eventually I was hospitalized for three days when I had an EKG reading that ended up being dangerously low.

In the following years, I would try working out in order to improve my self image, but I would still try to undereat in order to control my weight. I have never become “overweight” again since my initial weight loss in my teens, but it’s a constant fear of mine. I never stopped thinking about food and calories and numbers and the like. It basically is a part of my life now that will likely remain with me forever. It also continuously strained my relationship with my now ex boyfriend, who was constantly worried about me getting sick again.

We are now broken up (for unrelated reasons) and now I am with my current boyfriend whom I have been with for 3.5 years. We have a great relationship and we live together. These past three years, I have been doing okay with just living and not worrying as much about food. I’ve been suffering from other issues, mainly high anxiety and alcohol abuse, but I thought that I might be free from my past of distorted eating.

I am now 23 years old, and I just started a new medication about a month and a half ago for my anxiety which has been severely impacting my life. Sure enough, it just so happens that this medication has zapped my appetite completely and as a result I’ve lost some weight. I am 5’5” and now I weigh 110 lbs, which has been severely triggering me. I like being this thin. And now I would like to be thinner. And with this medication, it seems like it would be easy to just keep losing weight since I don’t even want to eat. It’s very scary how happy I am about this.

At Christmas, my parents made a comment about my weight loss and they seemed a bit worried. My boyfriend also asked if this weight loss was intentional or not. I don’t want to worry him in any way, but I am worried myself, you know? My past relationship was constantly filled with anxiety about my eating disorder and that’s not a place I want to go back to.

hi so i've been struggling with an eating for months. i don't want to self diagnose and say i have an eating disorder but i think i might have one. i told someone about it on reddit and discord (both places that were meant to have EDs talked about) and they both told me that i might have an ED specifically anorexia nervosa i'm pretty sure. 

from the time that i've told the chats about my eating problems it's gotten a bit better but worse at the same time. 

i've started eating more but once it hits night time i regret it so much and have suicidal thoughts. i say to myself that i'll starve myself the next day but always end up eating a meal or two and i hate it. i also started becoming a bit obsessed with calories. 

if anyone has any advice on how to stop this please please please tell me. i don't want to live the rest of my life like this. i'm still young i'm just 14 and i don't want to go on like this. 

before anyone even says it, i cant talk to anyone. i only live with my mother and wouldn't bring me

My relationship with food is so fucked up. :( 
there are only specific people i can eat in front of. and even that is complicated... which i won’t even get into. 

so honestly as a hard and fast rule: do not eat in front of others 

but....i work 12hr shifts. I get a 30min break, but i’m often too anxious to actually get and consume a proper meal for a multitude of reasons. again... complicated (bc i straight up do not even cook meals for myself to bring to work the next day!!!)

that being said, every day i am given 2 options:

1. Starve. let my demons eat me. 

2. Eat in front of others. 

tbh, 1 is my default, but I realize i must face my demons and eat in front of others. 

so i do. but i’m worried because i can only eat food that is “safe” which in my case is yogurt, crackers, and fruit cups.

I ate the entire sleeve of crackers when the serving size is only 5 crackers.

Some background and a bit of recovery so far: 

Hi it's my first post on here I don't really know how to use reddit but I check out the ed subreddits a lot for encouragement and other people's experience with recovery. I'm 14 and it started this year in March. The things I do is restrict, over exercise, count, and have a strict routine (my doctor told me I was anorexic). I've been seeing a psychologist since September this year and she's been really helping me figure out the cause of my ed and processing all the emotions. I was at my lowest weight in August to September and I felt really sick all day and got a lot of bad symptoms (ex: hair loss, cold all the time, brittle nails, low energy, etc). It made it hard to go to school :( (I'm at a new school this year and I've made no friends so far which has been making me feel worse. I was never like this before but with my ed I'm more nervous around people and I start to shake or freeze if I try to talk to someone or even the thought of trying to talk to someone :(( any tips for that would be nice)

Since then I started increasing very slowly since I was really scared of weight gain. I was also increasing my exercise to earn my food. Since then, I have gained a little bit and I'm at a weight that's still too low but feels high to me and I don't want to gain more. Later in October, I started increasing my intake by a little every Sunday. I liked doing this at first but then I realized why I liked it. I did it because it still gave me control and I was still restricting by not going over the limit I gave myself. Anyways, with my psychologist I've been working on accepting the weight gain and that I need it to recover. 

Today was the first day that I didn't restrict, I ate at random times, and I listened to my physical and mental hunger.

1088,eating_disorders,"Hi,
For the past 6 months I’ve been suffering with an eating disorder on and off. I mean compared to when it first started I think I’m doing better but I’m not sure.
When it first started I would barely eat and if I did, it would be no carbs or sugars and if I did eat them, I would feel bad and regret eating it. On top of that I would work out at least 5 times a day and weigh myself constantly. For a while it got better but now it’s back to being bad again. Now I count calories on a app and I get anxious when I can’t count them or my net calories get over 300. Currently, I have to do workouts that equal to over 1000 calories or I get really anxious and feel bad and on top of that I get anxious if my total net calories for the day goes over 300. My body Dysphoria is bad too to the point where I like myself in the mirror but dislike myself in photos and I feel like I’m fat. I’m aware that this isn’t healthy but no matter how hard I try to stop it, I can’t. My parents are semi aware of this and I know I need to get help but I don’t know how to ask for help and what helps entail.

1089,eating_disorders,"I'm at uni and recently started seeing someone who told me that they had an eating disorder. I know they're active on ED subreddits so trying to keep anonymous, they've gone home for Xmas and I won't see them until January, they live in a different country. 

Basically for this month they were trying to do a month in which they didn't do any purging or binging because they wanted to get better, and for most of it it went okay, a few blips, but most days fine. Before they left we had some snacks and I found out they'd purged, I told them that they don't have to hide it from me when they're with me and that there's no shame about having done it that I wanna help them and I understand I can't 'cure' them and its too complicated to understand without suffering, but that I wanted them to feel comfortable enough talking to me about it so that they can be honest. They apologised at first but I told them not to apologise or feel ashamed or that I was judging them, and we ended up just sitting there cuddling and they said thank you, the night went on as normal after and it was a nice evening. 

Now, they're back home and they said that things are getting worse and they don't know whether they want to get better anymore,  and that last 2 days since they got back were awful. Parents aren't an option to talk to, and they said that they feel like when they talk to me they're weighing me down and that it is overwhelming for them to talk about because they feel like it doesn't make them feel better and that its just an uncomfortable conversation. I'm not trying to offer advice or anything I just listen most times when we do talk, and let them do most of the talking. I don't want to force them to talk but I want them to feel comfortable talking to me, I get the relationships not been going on for long but I really am invested in it and just want to see this person happy and healthy. I know that that won't happen because of me, but I really want to help them stay in that mindset of getting better and feel like I am someone they can trust with this issue. 

Im sorry if this has been a bit of a long and frustrating post to read, I've never really dealt with it before; my question is how can I create a safe judgement free space in which we can talk about this and make the person feel comfortable around me?",,Helping a partner,1,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,k0ejxw,1,throwaway204200,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/k0ejxw/helping_a_partner/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/k0ejxw/helping_a_partner/,1606254397,451,0,0,0,-1,1,"Partner trying to create a safe, non-judgmental space for their significant other to talk about their eating disorder",neutral,"Partner encourages open communication and expresses willingness to help, Significant other feels overwhelmed and unsure about talking to partner about their eating disorder, Significant other is experiencing a relapse and doubts their ability to recover",Partner trying to create a safe and judgment-free space for their significant other to talk about their eating disorder,neutral,"The partner is trying to be supportive and understanding, The significant other is struggling with their eating disorder and feeling overwhelmed, The significant other is hesitant to talk about their eating disorder with the partner",Partner trying to create a safe and judgment-free space for their significant other to talk about their eating disorder,neutral,"Partner is supportive and understanding about their significant other’s eating disorder, Significant other is struggling with their disorder and is unsure if they want to continue with recovery, Significant other feels overwhelmed talking about their disorder and feels like they are weighing their partner down"

1091,eating_disorders,"For context, it all started just before quarantine. I (F16) started restricting what I eat and I learned about calorie counting. Stupid me started eating 900 cal per day which is obviously way too little for me, even though it's not as low as some people go. I was extremely obsessed with food. When I went to sleep I thought about what I would eat in the morning, I would even try to count the calories for the next day in my head. In school I was always tired, hungry and cold and I couldn't stop thinking about food. I would spend way too much time at the grocery store comparing labels to get the most low calorie option. I would weight every gram of food I ate. And of course during the quarantine I had alot of free time and I would exercise for 2h per day, sometimes even more. All that went on for about 3 months, I lost some weight and ended up losing my period. I started binging uncontrollably and got my period back. I would find myself in the kitchen, binging on sweets. I started buying large amounts of sweets, for example a bag of cookies, a chocolate bar and a bag of candy and I would eat all of it at once. I would always think to myself ""this is my last binge, I'm getting back on track tomorrow"". But every day I would just wake up and have an extreme need to binge. I binged every day, stopped working out and gained more weight than I had lost. During summer I kind of got back on track, started working out again and tried to eat healthier . 

But now I just don't know what to do. It feels like I can't just eat normally. I don't restrict and I don't binge as much as I did before, but it happens sometimes. I overeat almost every day and even the smallest restriction triggers me. I'm addicted to sweets and I need to have some everyday. I am of course worried for my looks because like any teenager I am abit insecure with my body but I am even more worried about my health. I can't imagine all the damage I did to my health with the restrict/binge cycle and with the large amount of sweets I eat every day. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from restricting what I eat. I wish I could eat like normal people do, in normal portions. 

I've only talked about this with one friend but not in too much detail. I don't know if I had or have an eating disorder because sometimes it seems like it wasn't serious enough to be considered as one.

1092,eating_disorders,"As much as i hate to admit it, i think instagram models/celebs have played a big part in my eating disorder. My eating disorder strated with the thrive that i wanted to look like them since i was 16. Now i'm 20, i just got out of the clinic and beat anorexia her ass. I've gained 15 kilo's and i'm looking healthy again. 

However the last couple of weeks my eating disorder is giving me a hard time. I''ve been thinking a lot that i'm fat and thinking about how skinny (underweight!) i used to be. 

In my recovery i started noticing some things i couldnt notice by myself in my ED.  I could not eat around guys (i'm female btw). I remember my exact thoughts, spending a whole date with a man and being so hungry but i would simply just not eat cause i thought my belly would get bigger if i would, crazy! I've made big moves in my recovery. I think about 4 weeks ago me and a guy  that i was interested in ate a bag of chips together, this was so huge for me!

I'm seriously interested in another guy right now and i guess we could get quite serious. My feelings are real. I have not told him about my eating disorder. He follows a lot of IG models on instagram, or simply just girls that he maybe has been with in person with INSANE bodies that follow him back. Instagram models make me sad cause i will never be like them and if that is what he likes, why should i bother? it really triggers me into wanting to lose weight again so that i can be like them.

I am aware that these thoughts are ridicilous and i should work on them 100%. But i was wondering, is it okay to ask ur significant other to unfollow models? For me its just so triggering, my ED was based of insecurities and comparing and it doesnt really help me.

I'm not dating him but im just thinking about my future like would it okay for me to ask a man (and tell him about my ED) to unfollow? or am i being ridicilous? I feel like i am lowkey. But i was wondering if anyone with an ed has experience with and how it impacts you and how do you maybe talk to your partner about it?

I don't know how this happened. It started as a simple diet to get rid of the 5 lb gained from studying for the MCAT exam over the summer.

I started by cutting out carb-rich foods. Then I cut out dairy. Then salty or fatty or oily foods. Then I started cutting my calories down to 500 calories/day. Then I started purging if I ate more than once a day.

The weight came off. I lost the 5 lb, then 10 lb, then 15 lb. But it doesn't matter. I can't stop.

The worst part is that now when I try to eat something, I don't enjoy it anymore. I don't enjoy the foods which I used to love anymore. I used to love daal, pasta, dosa, ramen, grilled cheese sandwhiches, etc. I even wrote a 3 page paper for English class in high school about daal, my most favorite food.

But today, I couldn't even finish an avocado.

So, sometimes I eat just fine. I'll eat what I want when I want, 2 meals a day (generally skip breakfast because I'm lazy and wake up five minutes before work, but I take an early lunch) and I eat balanced meals but don't only eat healthty, I'll eat desserts, fast food, and junky food too (all in resonable amounts). But other times I have a coffee in the AM and don't eat anything the rest of the day until dinner, and if I do eat, it's generally not eat a full plate (I live at home, so dinner is a family sit-down event). These decisions are generally unintentional, like I just do it because depression or I'm so busy I forget and am like ""oh well""- obviously not healthy but

Other times I'm like, ""okay, you can only eat 500 calories, maybe a little more depending on coffee but make sure you drink water because it helps with making you feel full and you'll lose water weight because bloat"" because I get insecure and depressed and then depending on how many days I've been doing that I'll eat everything. And then I'll looked up the definition of binging and it's described as uncontrolled and not being aware of how much or what you're eating, I don't think that fits me. But when I finish eating a lot, snacking, bored eating. I'll spend the next day eating very little- coffee or energy drinks, and then on day three I'll often go back to my usual 2 meals a day, no restrictions, maybe some junk food in moderation. There's no specific pattern except for with my mood, but even then it could be a couple different outcomes...

So I suffered from anorexia about a year ago, I got into recovery or should I say I started binge eating which my “Health at every size” dietitian started justifying. Basically telling me to throw away my scale and eat whatever I want as long as I pay attention to my body.

I did that and gained a whopping 100+ lbs. I developed insulin resistance, knee pain, and my blood pressure skyrocketed.
I had a bmi of 36. And my doctor who was aware of my ED suggested safe and slow weight loss. 

I started losing weight about a month ago and bought a new scale. I stopped buying junk food and began eating more fruits and veggies.

But whenever I finish my meals or snacks, I feel hungry about two hours after (especially at night) and I deny myself food. It makes me feel like I’m relapsing. I’m scared. It’s hard to talk to my therapist about this. She believes I need to lose weight safely, but I don’t even know how.

I’ve seen three dietitians in the past. One was the health at every size who encouraged me to binge. SMH. The other one wanted me to put on 20 pounds in one month which terrified me, another believed I was just “fat and making excuses”.

Tbh my issue with food is making me suicidal. I don’t know what to do anymore. Idk if I’m dieting or relapsing.

1103,eating_disorders,"Hey guys,

I just wanna make clear that I’m not diagnosed for anything, but I definitely have had a very unhealthy relationship with food.

In short, I am not too fond of weight gain, because of that I’ve been eating only 1400-1600 calories, sometimes less, with very little carbs.

I guess I had a bit of a health scare when I realized that my weight had dropped to 126-127lbs (I’m 180cm male), and when I noticed that my hair has become thin and my scalp visible when I ruffle through my hair.

Not gonna lie, the hair-loss thing has made me very anxious. I really can’t tell if it’s my genetics or if it’s because I have some sort of nutritional deficiency...

But yeah, I’ve been making sure I eat more and healthier since I’d noticed.

Anyways, I know a big part of this post is about hair loss really, but I thought I could find some people with similar stories... I’m quite the anxious the type, and because of that a lot of things get to my head easily.

1. Pls seek professional help if needed whether you are struggling of what form, it doesn't matter whether u meet the diagnosis requirements or not cause every individual is different

2. BMI is truly not an accurate indication of whether you are healthy or not. Especially in sports where muscle weigh more than fats and how everyone is just different with some having heavier bones than others? 

3. If you're lacking financially to seek help, u should at least tell a friend or talk to someone, even if it's the last thing u wanna do

4. Puberty is a stage of a lot of changes and you may gain weight but you are not fat just because you go through puberty &amp; u should not compare yourself before and after puberty 

lastly, I kinda get how trapped u feel between recovering &amp; falling deeper in &amp; I just wanna say pls don't give up and if you're ever suicidal, pls tell an adult or whoever and trust me, it'll get better and 1 or 5 years down the road you'll be grateful &amp; so freaking proud of yourself for holding on

i melted down in front of my mom which i never do. she took me to therapy and my therapist diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety. but i was somewhat confused. how could i be depressed now? i have been feeling this way since i was younger. was i depressed all along?  


my depression was pretty bad id say. i had no energy to do anything, i wasnt eating properly, i didnt feel any joy. and about 3 weeks in my depression, i decided to weigh myself because i havent been eating so much so maybe i would lose weight because i was trying to lose weight about months before but didnt work. and once i stepped onto the scale, i lost about 3 kg. and that gave me a spark of joy. the first feeling i felt in weeks. and i jsut wanted to feel that again so i started to starve myself. my mom noticed it and there were times she cried while asking me to eat. i was so mad because i just wanted to lose weight. at that time i dont think i was still thinking about school. i was just thinking about my weight.   


eventually i dropped out of school and took a different path. one day, i just snapped and went downstairs when my family were eating breakfast. i said to myself, im going to eat a toast maybe. i took a bread out of the bag, put it in the toaster, and put butter on it. i ate it and just felt so good because i didnt have bread in the past 2 months or so. i havent had anything basically. i wanted more of that bread. took 2 more slices, toasted them, butter them, ate them. took a bowl, fill it with fried noodle, ate it. took another bowl of it. toasted 2 more slices of bread. drank 2 cups of milk tea. i was the fullest of all time. went upstairs and went crazy because i felt like i have ruined my 2 months journey. so i went to the bathroom and tried to purge. it was hard at first. but i did it. purged until i lost what i just ate. weighed myself again and it was beautiful. i felt clean. and that was about 5 months ago.  


i was doing better about 4 weeks ago, until i had a sleepover. we ate everything, i ate everything. no one knew i was dealing with this. so she couldnt stop me from binging. the next days after that, were worse. there wasnt a day passed without me purging. except for today because theres something going, i could get anything out. tried to shove a toothbrush even but nothing came out. that drove me to write this.",,how i sorta got an eating disorder,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,jsqxt3,1,trydorsia,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/jsqxt3/how_i_sorta_got_an_eating_disorder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/jsqxt3/how_i_sorta_got_an_eating_disorder/,1605168584,573,0,0,0,-1,1,"Severe depression and anxiety, weight loss leading to joy, starving oneself, binge eating, purging",harmful,"Depression causing lack of energy and joy, poor eating habits, Weight loss leading to joy and sparking disordered eating behaviors, Family noticing and being upset, sleepover leading to bingeing and purging","Severe depression and anxiety, desire to lose weight",harmful,"Started starving oneself to lose weight after seeing weight loss on the scale, Dropped out of school and took a different path, Had a binge-purge episode after a sleepover, Struggled with purging and was unable to purge on one occasion","Severe depression and anxiety, desire to lose weight, binge eating and purging",harmful,"Lost weight after weighing herself, which sparked a desire to continue losing weight, Started to starve herself and became obsessed with losing weight, Dropped out of school and took a different path, Had a moment of binge eating and purging, which triggered a relapse, Unable to stop purging, even when attempting to do so"

I wouldn’t say I’ve had an eating disorder, rather just ‘disordered eating’. I’m not sure if it’s just denial. Since 13-14 (?), I would have periods of restricting my portions and I would regularly weight myself. It wasn’t obsessive though, more like a ‘diet’ whilst I did cross country every week. I started keeping a calorie count on my phone (I must’ve been 53-55kg?)

Then I developed depression and stopped running. I kept restricting my portions, but I would have moments of binging on snacks. I would feel so guilty when I did, and tried to purge it but failed miserably (I have a phobia of vomiting/nausea)

I am now 18, I’ve done modelling here and there, I’m 5ft 8 (173cm) and 128lbs (58kg). I’ve been comparing my body in pictures with other models and I’m starting to feel desperate to lose weight to look like them. I’m more aware of my thighs when they brush against each other as I walk, the struggle to zip my skirt up, the way my stomach and back bulges when I wear jeans and a crop top. I hate how my chest sticks out and how wide my torso looks. I’m constantly staring at other girls’ stomachs, their figure and how their body doesn’t bulge in their clothes.

I started my calorie count on my phone again, and I’ve started abusing my Ritalin medication to kill my appetite.

A while ago I looked for affordable recovery resources, but  my country offers none. Right now I'm not in a bad place, emotionally,  but I've been worse. 

Since the pandemic started and I've been having online uni classes,  I've had this huge problem. I'm neglecting school responsibilities  because of my ED. 

When I had to go to school, I could devote my time to attend classes  and study in the library, being somewhere else surrounded by other  people. Worrying about school meant less time I spent worrying about my  ED. Now I spend 24/7 in my home, I don't have anything separating my  free time from my school time, and I spend all day thinking about what  I've eaten, what I shouldn't eat tomorrow, how much exercise I should be  doing later, etc. It takes so much of my energy and time, I wish I  could turn it off and actually do some schoolwork. It's hell. The worse  thing for me is that I can't bother with studying since I'm so worried  about other things. I am an academically inclined person, I believe my  worth depends on my academic achievements. I know it isn't healthy, but  that's just how I've seen myself since I can remember. 

Since last week I'm not attending the zoom lectures, I'm not  studying, I'm not even working on group projects that I usually would be  doing (they involve other people and I have a responsibility to them).  What makes matters worse is that I have ADD and I've never really learnt  how to deal with it, so having online classes is already difficult  because I have trouble organizing my time.

1114,eating_disorders,Bc of my eating disorder I moved out later than most. I’m living on my own in a brand new city for the first time. During covid. I don’t see people aside from my roommate. We’re not close and she talks ab how she hates her old roommate for being “crazy” so I can’t open up to her. She’d just had a break up and didn’t eat bc if that when we first moved in and she joked ab “at least neither of us eat” and my sick brain latched on to that. I can’t eat more then her and i get a sick satisfaction from having less food in the fridge. It’s totally fucked up. She eats normal now and doesn’t even know we’re in a competition.

So at my lightest weight I was exercising 2-2.5 hrs total a day, 6/7 days a week. Idk how I did it looking back at it now, esp cause I was eating 1200 cals or less. 

But I’ve gained my weight back after spraining my ankle and eating more.

I feel so fat, and I really want to get back to my lightest weight. 

Here’s the important part: I am obsessed with exercise. Funnily enough I hate it, but I like doing it at the same time. I get upset and feel guilty if I don’t do any exercise on “rest days” so I try to walk every day or do a leg/arm workout.

I do a 30 min HIIT, 10 min Jumping jacks, leg workouts, every other day and lift weights every other day. Is it too much? How can I stop being so obsessed with exercise?

TW: hi I’m a 11 year old female who has struggled with body image since I’d say last year. I’ve always been ok with how I looked, I saw no problems. Until people started to call me fat. This made me very unhappy and the more I looked at myself I could see how fat I really was. So I decided to start weighing myself. I weighed about 128 pounds which to me didn’t seem like much until I started researching: I found out that most 10 year old females weigh about 70-90lbs this shocked me and made me sad. The more I looked around I could tell how much bigger I was than everyone else. But I didn’t let it bother me and I tried to focus on myself until I turned 11. I’ve been weighing myself everyday I can’t stop, I weigh 144lbs and I lost 10 pounds in less than 2 weeks. I now weigh 130 pounds but it’s still too much. I want to be skinnier but nothing works. I count my calories and eat under 1200 calls a day. There’s been weeks where I binge and purge by working out for hours. I’ve been noticing my habits and been realizing I want to fix this- but also I don’t want help and need to get skinnier.  I notice how skinny my older sister is compared to me and how little she eats which makes me upset. I also get upset if I gain 1 pound and get put in a furious mood. I do see a therapist but that’s for my anxiety and I haven’t talked about my eating habits to anyone but my sister.

1127,eating_disorders,"I recently read a book that talked about the buddhist approach to life. This revelation may have cured my eating disorder.

""No matter what the mind experiences, it usually reacts with craving, and craving always involves dissatisfaction.

For example, when the minds experiences pain, it craves to be rid of the irritation. But when the mind experiences pleasure, it craves that the pleasure will remain and intensify.

Thus, the mind is always dissatisfied and restless:

We either fear that the pleasure might disappear, or we hope that it will intensify.

However, a person who does not crave cannot suffer.

So how do you accept things as they are, without craving?

By asking yourself the question ""What am I experiencing now?"" rather than ""What would I rather be experiencing?""

As a result, you may one day experience reality with the utmost clarity, free of fantasies and delusions.""

This summarises briefly the complex principle that ""suffering arises from craving"". I'm still so excited and thrilled to have finally fully understood what this means. I might just be ready to move on with my life from this engrossing eating disorder.

1128,eating_disorders,"For as long as I can remember I have struggled with my weight and have been insecure about it. I have been diagnosed with major depression which I know can result in over-eating or under-eating. I go through phases (which last months) where I either overeat and eat whatever I want (unhealthy, fast food, snack type of stuff) with the mindset that I am fat, nothing is going to change, and it doesn’t matter. I am always hungry during this phase. The other phase I am obsessed with calorie intake, seeing how much weight I have lost, always checking scales, restricting meals, and eating “healthier” (which just means when I decide to eat it isn’t junk food.. i drink a lot of protein shakes or smoothies as meals) I am always less hungry during this phase and more repulsed by food.

This is how I’ve lived for quite a while now but I’ve never addressed it. Whenever I talk to drs I always just say that my appetite and my weight fluctuates because it is true. I don’t decide when the phases start - they just do.. and I can never find a reason why.

Im in my 20s and have struggled with an underactive thyroid since i was 16. I've never been obese. Anyway my grandparents called me fat for 20 minutes taking the piss out of me. This was a month ago.

I thought I'd get over it but now I cant eat 'normal' size meals or meals 3 times a day. I can no longer look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgust and if I eat anything or finish my meal before anyone else I get this voice in my head telling me how fat I am and this is the reason no one loves me. Its really aggressive.

I've never had this before no matter how fat I've felt in the past. This voice won't go away even if I try and block it out and im suddly really defensive when someone asks me why I've skipped a meal but I cant tell anyone.

I don't allow myself to eat most of the time because I don't feel hungry, like I figured that if I don't feel hungry then what's the point to eating but then I started worrying the people around me.

I'm not ""hungry"" until I've already eaten something but once I've eaten one thing I can't fucking stop until I hate myself for how much I ate.

The few times that I have felt ""hungry"" have been in public but I refuse to eat in front of people so I just don't eat anything until I'm not ""hungry"" anymore, but then I go home and I binge because I remember being ""hungry""  earlier, despite not being even peckish in the moment that I start to binge.

If I don't look at the time then I don't want food at all, I link eating to times because it's how everyone's raised (e.g. lunch at 12-1pm), but I don't wanna do that. I wanna eat when I'm hungry, but I never am.

My ex girlfriend and I dated for 4 months and she dumped me about a month ago because she has struggled with body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) in the past and our relationship was causing her to relapse. She didn't tell me anything about her body dysmorphia or eating disorder(s) until she broke up with me and when she told me she didnt tell me the severity or type she struggles with, she also told me I'm the first person she's ever told bar her family I presume. She told me she never lost feelings for me but she can't be in a relationship right now and as she can only see me romantically she doesn't want to see or talk to me at all. We didnt have an unhealthy relationship at all and would talk about things thoroughly if either of us were upset over something but I can see how she must have found it stressful as she felt she couldnt talk about her body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) with me. I see her commenting on pictures of her on Instagram saying she looks fat and also changing one of her online names to even include ""big"" and ""fat"" in it. I'm really worried about her but reluctant to reach out to her as she made it clear to me she doesn't want that.

1133,eating_disorders,"
This is the first time I have actually shared my story with anyone other than some close friends and my partner, so I'm sorry if it sounds rambly-

It started back in 9th grade when I joined the dance team with my sister. I didn't have my own car yet and my mom was in charge of taking me to school. Part way through the year as I was working out for 3 hours a day (long practices and only Sundays off) my mom started saying things like ""you are eating right?... Make sure to eat until you are full..."" And she would start before school taking me to McDonald's for their breakfast, and packing extra pizza in my lunch. (She worked part time at a pizza place and got to take home leftovers which were always our lunch). 

For dinners, sometimes my dad would cook, but it was mostly cycling between the next fast food place. And the drinks we always had stocked in the house were sodas.... Nothing else. At this time I was healthy and mostly muscle.

Then at the end of the dance year during one of our last performances, I did the splits and felt a pop. I didn't strech good enough before the dance and tore a ligiment in my inner thigh. I couldn't dance or swim (the other sport I loved) competitively any more.... But the diet remained the same.

By 11th grade I was overweight. This is when my mom decided that maybe it was no longer good for me to have pizza for lunch and said I need to go on atkins because I was so big. So my diet then consisted of a protein bar in the morning, a shake at lunch (I would walk to my car and park a block away so none of my classmates could see me drink it) and then dinner was still.... Well mostly fast food. 

As you can guess it didn't work. I graduated at extremely overweight As time kept going I moved out and tried to loose weight, sometimes I did but it never stuck. What always stuck was I hated my body. 

When I was 20 my mom decided we should do ideal protein together. I agreed because I was sick of feeling so big and unhealthy. And for a while it really worked! But it turns out that diet wrecked my body. Even though I lost weight I was the unhealiest I have ever been.

Now I am 25. I have thrown out the scale and tried to focus on eating healthy, doing some workouts and trying to stay active, but its hard. I'm grown now and need to be responsible for my own health and not blame my health now on my mother... But still looking in the mirror sometimes I hate it. At night I'll lie in bed after my partner is asleep and scratch and squeeze my belly really hard. 

Most days im fine, but today for some reason (it snowed alot and we haven't gone on our jogs and I have been under the weather so I don't workout) it hit hard. I took a shower this morning and was sobbing when I looked down. 

I don't know why that childhood keeps creeping up.... I thought I dealt with it. So why am I still struggling?

TL:DR- young childhood eating disorder has been creeping back up, but I really don't want to be mad at my mom anymore because I'm grown now

1141,eating_disorders,"Hey everyone... so I’m a little late to the recovery game. I’m in my early 30’s and seeking treatment for the first time. While I’ve had disordered eating most of my life, I don’t think I had tipped the scales into a diagnosable problem until the last couple of years. I have struggled with calorie restriction with intermittent periods of binging and purging by vomiting, laxatives, and exercise. In that time I lost a significant amount of weight and was praised for my “dedication” and “discipline.” It was intoxicating all while the disorder only kept getting worse... more “rules,” more self deprecation, feeling dizzy/lethargic and irritable...

I can’t do it anymore... so I’m trying.

Today is the first day in memory that I ate an exhorbinant amount of food (I’ll spare the details as I don’t want to trigger anyone but suffice it to say, I fed a family of four into my own stomach in a little under 2 hours) WITHOUT TAKING A LAXATIVE OR THROWING UP. And while there is a part of me that’s proud—there is a bigger part of me that is completely terrified.

I’m not severely underweight (lower end of normal BMI) and so my disordered mind is screaming at me that I’m going to be SO fat from this binge. That I can’t “afford” a binge like that because I don’t have “weight I have to gain.” It’s telling me that I should restrict even more than usual tomorrow since I didn’t purge today.... it’s basically torturing me. I can feel how distended my stomach is and I’m trying so so hard to remember it won’t just stay that way forever and that I shouldn’t try to throw it all back up... but I’m panicking. 

I’m not trying to be whiney. I want to get better and I fell into the binge cycle but I’m trying to at the very least not follow into the purge cycle too. I guess I’m looking for advice? Tips? How did anyone else get out of this cycle. How do you not shovel every morsel into your mouth when you allow yourself a “cheat food?” And how do you beat the numbers game in your head to not overly restrict your calories to compensate later?

I want to get better.... but this is so hard and I feel alone and freakish... I feel badly for having engaged I these destructive behaviors when I’m not supposed to. I feel badly that I’m in treatment and can’t seem to be “in recovery.”

1142,eating_disorders,"Hello everyone.  I am sixteen and have been struggling with anorexia/bulimia and a bingeing/restricting/fasting cycle.  I am severely restricting my calorie intake and sometimes have binge eating episodes  which I will try to purge using laxative abuse and fasting.

1145,eating_disorders,"TRIGGER WARNING: mentions of weight numbers and ed. 

Hi, I'm writing this because a few minutes ago I purged for the first time. I started going to this new school in fifth grade and at the beginning of the year I was very skinny. I was 11yo and around 80 pounds. A lot of people noticed how small I was and would always compliment me on the way that my body looked saying things like ""Wow how are you so skinny"", ""How are you able to eat whatever you want and not gain weight"", ""Your arms look so small"". At the time, I was healthy, I was just naturally small. Obviously because of all the attention on the way I looked, I started to become self-conscious about the way I looked and wanted to stay skinny because all the attention and compliments made me feel good about myself. I refuse to let myself gain any weight because that meant that people would no longer notice me and give me attention. I know it sounds like at the time I was an attention freak, but I couldn't help myself. I started working out everyday and watching what I ate because I wanted to stay small since everyone liked me that way. Summer started, which meant that I had nothing but time to focus on the way that I looked, I started working out even more than I did before and really being mindful of the things that I consumed. I thought that I was becoming smaller, but in reality I was getting bigger. Towards the end of summer, I realized that I had gained a lot of weight and I was so scared to go back to school since I was starting middle school and I would now be surrounded by 6th,7th, and 8th graders.

I was now 12 and 105 pounds. I didn't look like I was 105 pounds, but I was, and that was something that made me cry for hours. I was still small, it was just the fact that the scale said 105 and that number tortured me for months. 6th grade was fine, I got principle honor roll all semesters and student of the year. People didn't talk about the way I looked in a bad way, all the negativity coming towards me was from myself. Telling myself that I was fat and worthless. 

Fast forward, I'm in 7th grade and I'm 13. Last month I weighed 112 pounds now I weigh 104. I'm doing school online because of Covid-19, but that doesn't stop me from thinking that everyone thinks I'm fat. I've stopped eating regularly and I limit myself to 600 calories a day. I've lost weight, but I feel that I still look the same and that's why I can't stop. I want to lose weight even faster than I am right now. That's why a few minutes ago I threw up the dinner that I ate. I've never done that before and I honestly scared myself during the process. I'm hurting emotionally and physically, but I'm too scared to get help because my biggest fear is gaining weight and being 112 again. I'm in my room crying, wishing that I could be that happy, skinny, 11yo girl again. The one that loved hanging out with her friends and having a good relationship with food, but she is long gone and is nothing more than an old memory. I hate myself for the person that I've become, I'm not able to focus on the important things in my life like grades and chores because I'm too focused on what I'm going to eat next and how I can eat less calories than I did the day before.",,My ED story at 13,17,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,jhj76a,1,StephanieWright00,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/jhj76a/my_ed_story_at_13/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/jhj76a/my_ed_story_at_13/,1603582429,623,0,0,0,-1,1,"Negative comments and compliments about weight, fear of gaining weight and losing attention, self-consciousness about body image",harmful,"Developed an eating disorder and body dysmorphia, Restricting calories and purging meals, Physical and emotional harm, Difficulty focusing on important things in life","Receiving compliments on her weight and body shape, becoming self-conscious about her weight and body shape, fear of gaining weight",harmful,"Developed a negative mindset towards her body and self-worth, Restricting food intake and limiting herself to 600 calories a day, Purging after meals to lose weight quickly, Feeling emotionally and physically hurt, Difficulty focusing on important aspects of her life","Negative comments and compliments on weight, fear of gaining weight, limiting calorie intake, purging",harmful,"Developed a negative body image and became self-conscious about weight, Started limiting calorie intake and purging after gaining weight, Experiencing emotional and physical pain, Difficulty focusing on important things in life due to preoccupation with food and weight"

1147,eating_disorders,"Hey guys I just wanted to share my story on how I got this way since I don't know how I'm going to recover.

When I was in quarantine I ate alot of food because I was bored and I didn't exercise at all in 1 and a half months. I soon had stretch marks and I was really self conscious so I was determined to loose weight.

I started off being almost 80kg. At first I ate healthily and I excercied everyday. But I decided to take it another step further by eating less and less food everyday to the point I felt stressed to eat food and felt comforted not eating at all. 

Then I became sick and lost more weight than I should have. Only having a small bowl of porridge, and apple, a kiwi fruit and 2 strawberries a day at some point. Since then my mental health has gotten worse and worse.

I ended up being 59kg when I first went into hospital. They thought I was doing good so they let me go and I lost more weight. Now I'm in hospital again and I just feel like if I eat food it's going to make me fat since they put me on a meal plan and I'm sitting in bed all day. I'm now going to miss school camp and I already missed stuff I planned with my friends and now when they are having fun I'm just lying here. Doing nothing.

1149,eating_disorders,Hello everyone. I have been struggling with anorexia and disordered eating and I sometimes abuse laxatives after a binge to try to compensate and get all the binge calories out of my system as soon as possible. I realize this is dangerous and unhealthy and I really want to stop because I think all the misuse has caused me to get constipated whenever I do not take them. I actually have to take Miralax every day because it was prescribed to me by my doctor for previous chronic constipation and my prescription is 8g/day as per my doctors recommendation. When I abuse the laxatives I will typically take 68g Miralax and 32mg Senna (the recommended dose is 8mg and the Senna was not prescribed to me) after a binge. I only take the Senokot after a binge and I will gradually taper down the Miralax in the days following a binge until my next binge happens and the cycle restarts again. I realize this is way too high of a laxative dosage and that is why I want to stop misusing as soon as possible. I am currently five days since my last binge and I am currently taking 16g/day Miralax and feeling like I have constipation now which is only making it harder to try to recover and have normal eating patterns. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how to stop abusing laxatives without developing constipation. I want to get back to taking my prescribed 8g/day dosage worry that I have misused the laxatives so much that I now have a dependency on them.,,How to stop abusing laxatives without getting constipation?,1,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,jg5q2m,1,More-7712,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/jg5q2m/how_to_stop_abusing_laxatives_without_getting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/jg5q2m/how_to_stop_abusing_laxatives_without_getting/,1603392302,267,0,0,0,-1,1,"Abusing laxatives after a binge, taking more than the recommended dosage",harmful,"Experiencing constipation and having to take Miralax every day, Worrying about developing a dependency on laxatives, Desiring to stop misusing laxatives to get back to a normal eating pattern",Abusing laxatives after binge eating,harmful,"Experiencing chronic constipation, requiring daily use of Miralax, Misusing high dosages of laxatives, which is causing dependency, Difficulty stopping laxative abuse without developing constipation","Abusing laxatives, constipation",harmful,"Experiencing constipation, which is making it harder to recover and have normal eating patterns, Misusing laxatives to compensate for bingeing, Taking a high dosage of laxatives, which is causing dependency"

1154,eating_disorders,"So, things moved fast with this woman and me, we moved in quickly together, she got pregnant.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure I know what I've gotten myself into here. She was very honest about her eating disorder from the beginning; I'm a therapist and found it refreshing how open she was in general. I was super supportive before dating, trying to look up vegetarian recipes, offering to cook with her, for her.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who went through a low-key eating disorder himself and still do (mainly in that I still ate tiny lunches and large diners) I sometimes struggle with good-foods/bad foods, diet culture, etc. It was very difficult stomaching to eating out every single night but I did, because it was how she could eat/pick at food.

&amp;#x200B;

I have also been supportive in joining her with her nutritionist, once or twice her eating disorder therapist. I was joining her for this online support for eating disorders. The thing is, she doesn't really talk to her eating disorder therapist about personal stuff, she doesn't trust therapists after a very close one crossed boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

She's a vegetarian and extremely picky about what to eat. She doesn't eat mixed vegetables, fruits, salads, etc. She seems inflexible in planning out meals, eating left overs from the fridge. I've offered to look through the cookbooks she has with her and find things, but she says that sounds unappealing, especially while pregnant (She wasn't very keen on that before pregnancy).

&amp;#x200B;

As for eating out, before she became pregnant that was becoming difficult too. She doesn't like Chinese foods, health places, food that's too greasy, fast foods, Mediterranean  unless it's very authentic. It's basically Italian that's left after the criteria is done. She started becoming very fatigued with eating the same things at the same places, and then that became huge barriers in the relationship. I'm talking about literally spending HOURS about where she can eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Now she's pregnant and eating out isn't a thing. We stocked the thing with pizzas, Mac n cheese, Avocado toast stuff, some sliders I make, rice, soups, ramen. She won't eat a lot of repeats. I'll start getting anxious and list foods at her, because honestly, I can't figure what to feed her. I'll look through the fridge and pantry wracking my brain on what she could eat.  Just last week we spent hours on a single night because I couldn't think of what to feed her. She's often not sure what she can eat/tolerate/craves. If she doesn't know what she wants how am I supposed to know?

&amp;#x200B;

She's also gotten so stuck on food, she'll get delirious and then I've been left to feed her while she's in and out of it. That's happened about...6ish times since we've dated. Feeding her with a fork, lifting her head to feed her water/vitamin water with a straw. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's supposed to eat every 3 hours. It's been left to me to remind her/try everything to have her eat, according to the nutritionist and OB. When I haven't, she see's it as uncaring about the child, to her, low effort. As of now, I'm logging what she's eating the past few days because her nutritionist wanted something to help her figure things out in what she's eating. The girlfriend has felt too uncomfortable in the past to log food in, which I understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting extremely fed up having to feed another god damn human being that isn't my child. I've NEVER had to decide what someone has to eat this hard. It's usually a quick collaborate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm willing to eat anything with her and be supportive. But I'm becoming SO SO exhausted spending time on this. I'm not sure if I'm even being an enabler. She becomes angry when I ""throw my hands up and give up"" on trying to help her figure out food to eat.

1160,eating_disorders,"Hello. This may be long but I am wanting to include as much information as possible. I am unsure how much information regarding calories or specific weights is allowed here. 

I am sixteen and male.  I believe I may have developed an eating disorder and may be struggling with anorexia.  I am technically underweight and I have lost a large amount of weight in the past six months or so.  I cannot give specific numbers on here because that seems to be prohibited in the rules.  I say technically underweight because I still believe I am fat even though I am in the underweight category for my age.

I am trying to lose weight by restricting my calorie intake and exercising because I am wanting to be even more thin.  I am obsessed with counting calories and macronutrients on a spreadsheet on my phone for everything I am eating.  I will become very upset and panic whenever I ate something that I consider to be unacceptable or not healthy enough.  Sometimes I will also overuse laxatives or start fasting for several days to try to compensate for whatever I ate that I considered to be not healthy enough.  I have heard about orthorexia as well and I believe this may apply to me also. 

Neither of my parents and none of my family or friends know about this.  No one has ever confronted me about having an eating disorder before.

I am not usually eating much and on restricting days I usually have one or two small meals each day and a protein shake.  I also do fasts for two or three days in a row sometimes.  I make sure to stay under my calorie intake goals for each day to continue weight loss.  I was hardly hungry at all today and I had one protein shake today and nothing else.  I had been fasting for the previous two days and I realize this is unhealthy and maybe anorexic.

I am writing this here because I believe I may have a problem and I am wanting to get advice or perspective from someone who is more familiar with eating disorders or someone who has gone through anorexia themselves.

1162,eating_disorders,"This is not to discourage anyone from seeking treatment, but i’m just curious as to whether or not anybody else has experienced this. When I went to residential for the first time in 2017 my eating patterns had been restrictive for a long time but I was not counting calories, I was far less anxious about knowing the exact nutritional content in everything I ate, and my BMI was well within the healthy range for someone my height. I definitely had issues with food but my eating disorder was not nearly as serious as most of the other clients I was with.

In treatment I picked up new behaviors and anxieties about food just from talking about it with the other clients 24/7 for weeks at a time. Plus, I felt like I needed to “retaliate” against my body for the weight I had put on in treatment. I relapsed even more severely, actually reaching an underweight BMI this time, and was sent to residential again for 4 months. This time the weight gain was even more dramatic since I started at a lower weight and again I picked up even more behaviors. 

It’s been about a year since I was released from residential and 6 months since I completed PHP and IOP, where I never technically “completed” but was transferred to another mental health program not focused on ED because my treatment team reached a stalemate with me and didn’t know how to help me further. 

I now have no insurance since I’m out of school and don’t anticipate being able to afford insurance anytime soon so I cannot go back to therapy or a treatment for the indefinite future. However, my ED is worse than it’s ever been. I am CONSTANTLY anxious about food and never not obsessing about the components of everything I eat, I strictly count calories, if I’m able to maintain a healthy weight it’s only for a few weeks at a time and it’s only a few pounds within my healthy BMI range, I measure out my portions and at restaurants I choose my meals primarily based on calorie count, but tbh eating out and not knowing the exact components of all the food gives me so much anxiety now I just generally avoid it. I also picked up an exercise regiment that probably isn’t healthy and take my weight/measurements multiple times a day. 

I was nowhere near this obsessive and destructive when I started ED treatment and a lot of the behaviors I do now are things I probably wouldn’t have arrived at on my own, but learned from spending so much time in treatment with people more sick than I was at the time.

1164,eating_disorders,"I've struggled with restriction in the past but no one really noticed. I'm generally pretty lanky but I gain weight in my center (stomach,back,boobs) and I think thats why when I started losing weight no one noticed or they complimented me. It was a subtle enough change to their eyes that make clothes lay on me better, but I was eating like 200 calories a day.  Only I noticed because I could feel my waist significantly getting smaller and my hip bones started to peek through which are things you can't see behind baggy sweaters. 

Anyway, regardless of not seeking real help I was able to kick the habit or so I thought. The thoughts always circled my head but recently it's been getting hard to ignore them again. I like the feeling of being in control of my life because usually it feels like life just happens to me and I have no say in any of it. 

I like being able to feel my body physically hungry and yet convince myself that I do not have an appetite and fully believe it. It makes me feel alive-  almost like a reminder that im not a robot and my body can actually feel things. Sometimes I feel like when I try to be positive and tell myself that no one judges me off of my appearance that I'm just lying to myself to feel better- like im avoiding a true bitter reality 
and I've never liked to be ignorant even if it is really bliss. 

I start hating people when they put me in positions to eat like my parents making me sit down for dinner or my friends wanting to go out to eat.

I have counted calories since sophomore year of high school and lost a little bit of weight (12lbs or so) and even though I purged once in awhile I consider it a healthy weight loss.

Now, however, I’ve begun to feel really guilty about eating. I started out just being strict about not going over my calorie limit (1,350ish) which made me feel good, but it’s escalating. For the last week or so I’ve eaten much less than the calorie counter app allows (600-800), and I’ve begun jogging as well. I’ve noticed that my pants are a little looser now, but I don’t have a scale in my flat so I can’t determine how much weight I would’ve actually lost? I limit my purging to like three times a week because I don’t want to mess up my throat, and I don’t binge, so it’s definitely not bulimia?

Basically I restrict caloric intake, purge infrequently, and I chew/spit ALL the time when I’m feeling snacky. But idk if it even really counts as an ED because I’m not underweight and I’ve not talked to anyone about it? I think I’m losing weight but without the scale I can’t determine how much.

1167,eating_disorders,"Been struggling with an eating disorder for a while now. It has messed up my life. I am currently working with an ED dietitian and a psychiatrist. My therapist ditched me if u wanna read that story, it’s on r/depression. 

I have rapidly gained and lost a significant amount of weight. I cry about my weight and even beat myself up for it (quite literally).

I absolutely abhor being weighed at the doctors office. I have even requested to not be weighed but they tell me they can’t do that. 

Today, I was very much tempted to look at the “post-visit paper” my doctor gave me and I was filled up with a lot of negative emotions. It was overwhelming to see how much weight I had gained. I cried over it. I self-loathed. 

My doctor even suggested that I’m might get diabetes and I have to work out more. (She knows i have an ED).

After having this breakdown, i messaged my ED dietician. We haven’t been in contact for a while because I moved out of the county. She hasn’t replied to me yet and I feel like I have no one to talk to.

I never had bulimia but I’m having urges to purge. It might be silly, but I get suicidal over my weight. I am diagnosed with depression and OCD as well which makes life much harder. I also have very low self esteem and been struggling with my weight since I was 4. 
I even missed two months of school last year because of my crippling mental health.

I'm a 18 years old Male trying to recover. I currently weight 52kg with a height of 185cm! (Really low!)

I finally decided I wanted to recover! I've done it before and relapsed, so I know I can do it! Last time i exercised 6 times a week and it was really hard. I got from 52kg - 63kg and didn't put on that much fat since i resistance trained that much. This time I've decided not to train at all. Only bike to school and the basics.

Is that going to make me skinnyfat/fat, if I just want a goal weight of 63-65 (Just inside Healthy BMI) I just don't want to exercise because it's probably also dangerous at my current weight. :x

This is my first post here but finally my parents saw how thin i looked and wanted to discuss it without being mad/angry. My sister had an ED for 5+ years where my parents screamed and were angry everyday. Basically I just played videogames and were sad all the time and secretly developed an ED too without them knowing. Atleast they never got a divorse from it. This is also why they want this time to help rather than being mad at me.

I was wondering about 2 things!

Is it okay to eat sugar during recovery? They bought Nutella but i already have 100% natural peanutbutter at home too. Is it okay to eat Nutella sometimes and switch it up, even though it consists mainly of sugar and not just hazelnuts? Also eat sweets like candy and chocolate bars? I've mainly been eating a lot of greens and chicken with high protein while losing all of my weight, so sweets and so on was a NOGO! (Typical ED behavior. Can't remember last time I had a Twix/Snicker/Mars bar) :)

Am I going to gain a lot of stomach fat if i don't exercise until I just the ""Healthy"" BMI chart?

1177,eating_disorders,"Hi there. 

Every single day I force myself to eat and manage to have about 2 meals. Def an improvement to a few months back. But still.. i hate this life so much. I am constantly thinking about food and calories and my horrific body and my weight and food and food and eating and ... i feel so incredibly helpless and have some physical pain, too. Doctors are dismissing me, even my therapist (who knows about my problems with food) seems to brush it off. I think she doesn't see the problem, told me i need to set goals if i'd wanted to change this and stick to them. That was it. And I have tried, oh lord. I bought this book ''8 Keys to Recovery from an Eating Disorder'' and am working with it- when i feel some hope. I unfollowed so many people on social media and instead followed body positive bloggers and ed recovered people who give very good tips. I try every day to fix this myself but i just CAN'T- it's a cage. I don't have the key, i just don't even know if it exists. 

Will it ever stop? I sit on the floor crying my eyes out after eating, every damn time and the getting up part is just getting too much, it's pointless. Why do i get up when i'm back on the floor a few hours later? what's the point? i don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, it's just lost. i feel like as if this battle is lost- before it has even really begun. And more and more i grow confident with the idea of giving up, for i don't see a point to live in this hell, day to day.

1178,eating_disorders,"I've struggled with food for as long as I can remember. It was never really a huge problem, I would have weeks where all I thought about was how much/little I was eating and then other weeks I would eat what I wanted without fear or worry. It all seemed to balance out, weight-wise so I never gained or lost much if any.

Additionally, I've always been pretty underweight but I'd recently gotten my weight up to like a healthy 105-107 (or rather, it felt healthy to me). I'm 19f and 5'5"" so it's still underweight but comparatively. And I noticed I was focusing more on food than usual so I told myself if I dropped below 100lbs I would need to reevaluate because that was 'too skinny' for me. But I weighed myself for the first time in a while this past weekend and I was hovering around 99.

I know the boundary I set for myself but I can't bring myself to eat enough per day to gain the weight back. I'm in a weird place where I still don't feel small enough but at the same time, knowing what my weight is on a scale has made me more confident because I *know* I'm underweight and I'm proud of it. I don't want to be. I hate that it makes me feel good to be too small, that the only way I can feel comfortable in my own skin is to be skin and bones but still worry about arm flab or the little pouch of fat that protects my literal organs.

1179,eating_disorders,"I’ve struggled with body image since I was little. When I was 11 (21 now). I told my doctor I was afraid to eat, but exercising made me feel a little better about it. At 12 I was “underweight” and not eating. Everyone I ate I felt sick. My parents told me that I needed to “stop” because people were noticing, but did nothing about it. For years I struggled. Then I didn’t, or that’s what I thought, but I felt confident with my body. Looking back my eating was still pretty disordered: I wouldn’t eat and then id eat an tire box of cereal or a box of goldfish or other snacks. 

 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication that is notorious for weight gain. Before, I had been “scale free” for about 10 years. I didn’t believe in them. A few weeks ago when I was feeling bad I bought one. I got on the scale and saw that I was 156lbs. 30lbs heavier and with BMI of 26/27. I’m 5 foot 4. but the scale also told me that my body fat % was pretty low, so I was confused. But I still felt disgusted with myself regardless. It’s hard to look in the mirror, hard to shower cause I can’t stand to see myself naked. I feel like a whale (though I don’t at all think other people who are heavier are ugly/or not worthy or anything like that). But I feel ugly and unworthy. I dread classes on zoom cause I can’t stand to see my fat neck. So I tried eating less. Did nothing. Tried eating less, stoped taking my full dose of meds, and walking 8 miles a day, obsessed with tracking everything on my Apple Watch: nothing. So I took to Instagram and found some wonderful accounts that helped people who were struggling. But I still don’t feel worthy of help: I’m not skinny, I try not to eat but then I do and I hate myself for it. The accounts were helping (finding exercise that I actually enjoyed instead of ones that I did for “punishment,” eat what you want to accept food and recover, etc. but now I had to coke hole because of my bipolar and my mom keeps talking about my weight no matter how often I ask her to stop. I told her I was struggling with eating, and that i was in recovery. She laughed and said I didn’t have an eating disorder. She keeps telling me I SHOULD be very aware of portions and how she’ll get me “back on track” weight wise. But that type of talk is so so damaging to me. It puts me back in a bad place. I feel like a failure: I don’t fit into most of my clothes anymore that I’ve had for years. I hate myself. I just want this al to stop.

So the only two people I’ve been comfortable enough to talk about my food issues with, their reaction are as follows

1) my grandma: promised she’d tell me if I was (direct quote)”chunking up again” (I used to be pretty overweight as a child, I can’t even look at those pictures now) and gave me weight loss advice as well as telling me walking was the best exercise 

2) my best friend: told me that instead of counting calories I should just make sure I only eat very healthy food (basically trade anorexia for orthorexia) 

So i really don’t know if I will be sharing this with anyone else haha

And yet I still feel like I’m faking for attention, despite barely telling anyone and desperatly trying to hide it from my family 

I don’t know what response I was really hoping for, maybe just some support? But I didn’t really get that so....
And yet my brain wants to be validated by hearing people say their worried about me, that I seem sick, that kind of thing, yet when my friend told me she is worried and she just wants bw to be healthy and happy and not malnourished like I freak out

1182,eating_disorders,"Back at the start or middle of middle school I used to diet A LOT and it was  extreme. At some point I thought that I might have an eating disorder but I brushed it off. When I was eating barely any calories too function back then, obviously high cal foods would scare me and if I was forced to eat by my parents, I would cry. Now, I eat whatever I want (kinda) just in a certain time frame and right now my mom is extremely busy so she doesn't have any time to cook. Due to this, we just bought some meals from the store that you can bake/microwave and eat. I went to go check the nutrition facts of one of the meal boxes and I almost had a panic attack. My heart just dropped. I have marching band and swim practice so I'll burn almost all of it off, but seeing the sodium content, cholesterol, and fat terrifies me. I just want to break down and cry, but there's nothing else to eat and I need the energy for swim. Like my mind is saying YOU BETTER NOT but my body's saying ""just eat it man"". Like I just don't understand, I'm going to burn it all and I'm not limited to a certain amount of calories so why am I so distressed????



I ate it anyways and as I ate, I felt such an overwhelming amount of depression.

1184,eating_disorders,"Hello! I am embarking on my next life goal, but am looking for thoughts/advice from the community before I find myself back in the trenches of my eating disorder.

For a little background, I just turned 30 and was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in May (which explains so much)! I have struggled with various eating disorders since age 8. I have been to treatment three times, with the last stint of 5 months in 2015. I feel like I am doing well in recovery, and my treatment team agrees. However, like I am sure many of us experience, I would like to be healthier and at a lower weight.

So, I signed up for Noom. I have not discussed this with my treatment team, or anyone TBH yet. In my defense, I signed up last night, kind of impulsively. I do intend to discuss this with my people.

I am hoping that with a program like Noom I can be held accountable and reach my health goals appropriately.

What I am wondering: is this already a red flag? Can people with a past history of eating disorder successfully work on healthy weight loss goals? 

A friend of mine described her life in recovery as constantly living with PTSD of her eating disordered self, and this rang true to me as well! I am hyper aware of the “me” I used to be, and definitely do not want to return! Ughhh, isn’t it tough?

1186,eating_disorders,"It's been 10 years. I want it to go away. 

I've done everything I was supposed to do yet it's still here and I still have it worse than ever. It makes me hate my life. I could've been so much more but here I am. I want it to leave and not bother me anymore. 

Can it please leave? 

How do you make it leave? 

I hate thinking about it every time I eat, look in the mirror, look down at my body, see other people eat. I wish i could be me and not this damn disorder, I don't remember how to be careless of what my body is like ; I forgot how to know when to start or stop eating, it's all the same. It's all hunger, all the time. I hate it so much. I hate myself so much.

I don't want to kill myself, yet but this feels worse than death. I can't live my life at all, everything is about food, all the time. I want to be taken somewhere without food so I can get over this addiction; just give me nutrients through IV fluid until I get over the food dependency. 

That is the only way, I think. Get it away from me for as long as needed, until i don't crave it anymore, until I only need to eat when actually hungry. I need to be starved of the habit before I can appreciate food for what it is meant to be. Take away flavor so I can understand its importance. Take me somewhere to only be fueled by water and IV fluid nutrients... But no. Those types of facilities aren't a thing, and nothing can help me but myself. So they say. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am an addict; people don't understand what it is to be addicted to something that gives you life; food is fuel, afterall.

Without it, you'll die. Anorexia.

Too much, and you'll die. Binge Eating.

Reject it, and you'll die.  Bulimia.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it so difficult? Life depends on your pacing of food, the tempo of eating. Keep it constant, and you'll live. 

Yet I want everything, all at once. Rushing through the delicacies of life, as if I'll die tomorrow. Maybe I will, if I keep this up. 

Death could be freeing... or it could be an endless loop of this disordered nightmare. I want to get better, I don't want to be like this forever. Eating, looking at my reflection, hating myself, doing what I can to rid it from my body. It's a vicious cycle. My heart hurts, from the sadness and the pain of my habits, but even it won't stop me from the sweet release of the intake &amp; expulsion of food. Neither will the debt it brings me, the beauty it takes away, or the relationships it burns. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'll be like this forever.

Maybe I won't.

Maybe it's only up to me.

I loss weight so fast yet I still see myself as a fat person. I hated it. Whenever I see myself in the mirror, I couldn't help but to cry a lot and starve myself.

Hope you’re all well and staying safe. 

I’m looking for opinions on whether I already have an eating disorder, or am beginning to develop one. 

To start off, I’m a 31 year old male and weigh 11st (154lbs). I’ve been skinny my entire life, a little too skinny some would say.

Recently, I noticed my clothes seemed a little more snug than usual and I found myself constantly looking at my body in the mirror. 

From there, I began weighing myself twice a day, counting everything I ate, and seeing how long I could go without eating. This would often result in me getting the shakes and breaking out in a cold sweat. 

I feel immense guilt after every meal, however I have never made myself sick or anything like that. I just beat myself up mentally instead. 

I absolutely love food and enjoy eating, which makes this all the more confusing for me.

As I said, I’m looking for opinions so I can nip this in the bud and seek help before it gets worse.

1194,eating_disorders,"**Please read &amp; share ur thoughts/opinions**, i feel that only people who struggle(d) with eating disorders can give me advice that might help me.

My 8-year journey of multiple eating disorders:

i became anorexic in grade 9 (2012) which lasted 4 years - i was about 5'6 and 85lbs at my lowest weight. i received out-patient care &amp; therapy, then became orthorexic once i started eating again. I was orthorexic for 3 years when i started university (2018) - i literally ate 0% plain greek yogurt, salad, and chicken with veg every day i lived away from home because i had the freedom to do so and i fet healthy and in control and i LOVED it when people would tell me how skinny and ""healthy"" i was. i felt traumatized when friends would invite me over for baked brownies and a movie, and it got to the point of me trying to fit in with them and eating junk. but i began throwing up after eating the junk because of how guilty i felt about eating unhealthy foods. at this point i was still thin and my body wasnt gaining weight because i did not excessively binge on shit.

then quarantine happened, i moved back home, and did a complete 180. too many triggering foods were available to me and i developed excessive binge eating habits on anything i knew was easy to throw up (it was never anything healthy fyi), followed by purging. it got so bad that i was probably eating over 5000 calories a day... and praying to god tht i purged enough to not gain any weight. Eventually i noticed that i was in fact gaining weight but i kept telling myself ""i will stop tomorrow"" - but i quickly became addicted to it because it was my only sense of purpose while living in my parents home alone all day doing nothing and seeing nobody (note: i would never have the guts to see my university friends right now because i really DO NOT want them to see how much noticeable weight ive gained, esp. when i was once known as the ""skinny friend"" - well, actually the *skinniest*).

now, 7 months into binge-purge bulimia, i have gained about 20 lbs (110lbs to 130lbs). my parents know everything about all my eating disorders, and ive become so manipulative along the way that im very good at hiding unhealthy behaviors from them. i have so many moments that i regret and hate myself for.  i hate looking in the mirror, i hate seeing cellulite i never had before. the worst part is when i compare how good i looked when i was orthorexic (note: i was actually healthy from a physical/medical point during this time) to how disgusting i feel that i look now. and i KNOW that i did this to myself by having unhealthy overeating and purging habits. i used to feel healthy and in-control and beautiful, now i feel fat and totally out of control.

ive managed to not binge/purge for 3 days now, but i have only been able to do it by restricting my calories, only eating 2 meals a day, avoiding snacks, and only eating low-fat low-carb meals. i do feel more in control about my habits but im not noticing changes in my body. i still see a fat pig in the mirror because i struggle with body dysmorphia.

can anyone else relate to this? is it bad that i have a hidden desire to reintroduce my anorexic/orthorexic tendencies??

1195,eating_disorders,"Hello everyone,

I really didn't know where to start to reach out for help. I think I am suffering from Bulimia.

Some background: I am an 18 year old college student (F) and this is actually my first semester at my university. I was valedictorian of my class in high school , graduated with an 8 point something, and even earned a college degree from a local community college in my hometown. Coronavirus hit, so my senior class obviously did not get to enjoy prom, senior trips, or even graduation. I said my speech over a youtube video. I understood it was for the greater good, but I think I was seriously getting depressed.

Now I'm all moved in to my dream school and I thought things would finally start to look up. However all my classes are online, I can barely meet/see any of my friends due to social distancing, and I'm really really homesick and lonely a lot of the time.

I got a 60 something on 2 exams last week. After studying my ass off, pulling all nighters, skipping showers, doing anything I can to understand the material for these difficult classes. I desperately want to have a 4.0. My dream is to someday go to med school. I just don't know what I 'm doing wrong. I'm using every possible resource my classes provide as well as external tutoring services. I have always been a good student and I don't know what's wrong with me. I put my all into school and I am getting nothing in return at this point. It may seem like I'm overreacting, but this is so extremely important to me.

On top of all this, I have always struggled with my body image. I don't like the way I look or feel in my body. But I have no time to go to the gym because I'm studying. So I skip meals and purge instead.

I haven't really been binging yet, but as my body slowly runs out of fuel, I can see that happening to me too. Sometime I eat something small, like a salad, just so that my stomach will shut up and I can refocus on school. But ultimately it just gets thrown up.

**It's not new for me to throw up when I'm stressed, but it's never been this bad before. I threw up blood this morning. Sometimes I throw up so much to the point where all that comes out is my stomach acid. The sides of my mouth are cut and bleeding from shoving my fingers so deep down. My uvula is always sore and cut up.**

All I do is drink coffee and water, just because I need it to keep me awake (to study more).

I hate feeling this way. I've partially told my boyfriend and sister, but definitely not to the full extent (as to not worry them). I have another exam this Wednesday, and I'm slowly losing my motivation to do well anymore. I can't hold any food down, my body feels frail, and I've lost about 10 pounds in a week. I'm happy I'm looking slimmer, but I know this isn't good for my health.

What do I do? I can't tell my parents. They would be extremely disappointed with me. My anxiety is at an all time high and I feel so so worthless. I don't consider taking my life, but I often feel lost and detached from myself.

No one gave much importance to it because shes naturally thin and she is developing the same figure that we have. We told her not to worry.

We went and I asked her if she was interested in alternative diets and she said no but she was not in the mood for pizza.

Hi! 
I need to see if anyone can relate bc I honestly can’t talk to anyone else about it. I used to have a really hard time eating and I would always restrict and not eat until 4pm. (PSA: i don’t have an eating disorder I’ve just struggled with disordered eating for the past couple years) I lost almost 50lbs. I’ve been getting better but I fall back sometimes (feels like every other day tbh haha). I think it was set off by a chronic injury I’ve been having. I got very depressed and anxious during this period too and I would get very agitated quickly with people I think. 

Ok let me get to the point. I really don’t remember much from the past couple years and I’m not sure if this is just me? Is it caused by the weird eating? I would go ask for help but I don’t want to take it away from people who actually need it and it might just be I have crappy memory. I wouldn’t know what to tell them anyways bc I have trouble remembering. I can only really remember how I felt and drinking like 4L of water and exercising every day.

God I don't even know what to say.

After a severe life changing injury, alot of it was mentally destroying but physically too. I put on a lot of weight. I have Pcos too. At 5ft1 and my heaviest weight of 16st.  Over the last 6 years i had dropped to 14. Last year I attended grouo oain clinic sessions which taught me to unhook from my unhealthy comfort eating  / eat my feelings moments.
That was good, great. It started my weight loss. I wasn't snacking or binging food.
Then i got the flu which decimated my appetite, just as i was recovering from that, i got the norovirus and that put me off all foods.
I have always had some issues and I have neber enjoyed food. It was just there and comforting. But i never have enjoyed eating.
Since November i have lost over 3 stone. There is roughly ba stone and half to go. I don't have a set weight in mind, I just want to get to where I feel comfortable in my skin again.

But where i have no appetite I'm struggling to eat anything most days. I am having to force myself to eat which i 99% of the time i cant do.
Since Thursday all ive had to eat is 1/4 of a fillet if fish and  6 mouthfuls of dinner  the night after.

I don't ever really feel hungry or get any signs of hunger. I've tried a few different ways to encourage myself to eat. Smaller less daunting meals. Meals that can be picked at even when cold. (I'm a slow eater and this is currently the thing that works best as i can just pick as and when) in the last few weeks which granted have been very difficult emotionally and physically and I've been very stressed but this technique doesn't really help as much as it did. For a while I was using weed to help. I smoke it for pain relief as currently this is the onky pain relief i have that works.

I don't want to make myself unwell or unhealthy as I would like to be healthy to have a child when i find the right person. Im almost 30.

I don't know if i have an eating disorder or not. But i know if i keep going the way i am I will. I have been on and off wanting to ask but at 13, 12 stone i didn't think it was much of an issue now I'm down to 10.6st  i am approaching where I feel comfortable ish. Im getting there. But im scared it will go to far and and i don't know how to help myself now.

I have a some health issues anyway and i don't want them to get worse.

I feel like I want to do something but like don't know how to.   
Somehow I feel no one (not even at home) believes me what I'm going through, and feel stupid for even trying to do something about it.

1213,eating_disorders,"hey! I've never talked to anyone about a possible eating disorder as I've been overweight most of my life and I just feel kinda stupid feeling like I might have an ED, and bringing it up so I thought I'd ask your guys's opinions😊 (I know you're not doctors, I'm just embarrassed to talk to them. I know you can't diagnose and I don't take your suggestions as diagnosis, but hopefully it'll provide me some insight)

In the last 2 years I've lost 85 lbs (215-126). I don't really restrict myself too bad or display typical eating disorder behavior, but I'm absolutely terrified of gaining weight 😅 the average weight for most of my life was 155lbs, and I felt so so horrible. My weight loss has also been a rollercoaster, I binge and hate myself then restrict and eventually lose it. I started out this year around 132lbs, went back to 147lbs in March, back down to 135 in July, and now at 126 (being 130 last 2ish weeks ago). I have more fat on my body than most people my weight which really bothers me, and no matter how much weight I lose its never enough. I have maybe 10 foods I let myself eat, everything else I've weeded out and try not to touch. Today I had 3 tacos, half a tortilla soup, half a bag of maltesers and half a bag of smarties. Yesterday I had 4 tacos, half a tortilla soup and half a bag of maltesers. The day before that I had half a bowl of ramen soup and a spicy mcchicken I think. And last week I hardly ate anything, I think I went a day without eating, and 2 or 3 days with eating one bowl of potatoes. Can't remember the rest. 
I don't exercise a whole lot but I try, today I walked a dog for 1 1/2 hours, and I was working at a school on my feet all day Monday and Tuesday. When I exercise more I let myself eat more. If I don't exercise much I'll let myself eat some potatoes and something else. 
I also spend most of my day smoking weed and cigarettes, which I hate. But if I'm craving food sometimes I just trade that for a smoke and I can push past it. 
I am obsessed with my weight though. I don't weigh myself as much as I used to, mostly out of fear to step on the scale. If I'm losing weight and feeling good I'll use it morning and night, and when I'm in mixed episodes I'll go all out and weigh myself before and after I use the bathroom and whatnot. If I'm gaining weight I generally don't use the scale unless I know I've gone too far and I need to know. But other than that I'm terrified to step on it so I tell myself it only takes one week to make a difference on the scale, next week you'll weigh yourself. I measure myself more, if I have something to measure myself with I try do it at least once if not twice daily. I'm constantly poking at my fat, or admiring the weight I've lost (if I'm feeling good about it) or squeezing my fat and wanting to cry in disgust with it all. I almost can't walk past a mirror without body checking. My worth is entirely tied to how I feel about my weight and I hate it. I've lost most of the muscle in my butt, it sags so bad. And my family is grossed out by how bony my elbows, chest and legs are 😅 (but my stomach still has so much fat!!) And my dad has said I don't look healthy 😅 (which can probably be contributed to the smoking)

1214,eating_disorders,"I come from three generations of ED in my family. Amount my grandma, mom, and I each of us struggles/struggled with an ED, always watching what we ate, trying different workout methods, and even resorting to dangerous methods like hcg weight loss shots.

My grandma died this past Spring, it was a sudden heart attack that no one saw coming. But when I put myself in the place of her I’m the week before she died, I feel so sad.

It was two months before a beach vacation when she died. She probably skipped Starbucks in the morning and drank black coffee instead, but she hates black coffee. She probably ate fish and broccoli from Publix instead of singing in the kitchen making the traditional Cuban foods she loves.

I can’t say I was there to see her do all this, but I lived with this woman for 10 years and I know how her and her ED operate. There is no doubt in my mind she dieted up until the day she died.

She spent her entire life chasing after a body that wasn’t hers, restricting herself and making life less enjoyable through little decisions everyday. 

And that’s just the food, don’t forget about the “I’m not good enough” or the “I don’t deserve to have a treat today I’ve already eaten so much.”

I want to cry thinking about how much time she wasted doing this to herself, and how for my life as well I’ve spent my time doing to same things.

My very first psychiatrist said the prozac would help me with the binges, which it did for a while but I'm on different medication now anyway.

*As men, we don't learn about eating disorders.*

* *From society, we hear that ""guys don't have eating disorders, only women do"".*
* *From our own brains, we tell ourselves ""it's not manly, it's shameful"".*
* *From our well-meaning friends, we hear ""you're fine mate, everyone eats a lot, don't make a big deal of it"".*

*Luckily, I've had CBT therapy in the last 18 months and am doing well now.*

*But I know how difficult it is for us men who binge eat.We firstly need to be aware that this exists as a condition and we then need to be able to admit to ourselves that we are struggling.Only then can we get the help we need.*

*So the stigma and the shame needs to change.*

*My mission is to make it easier for guys like me — and maybe if you're reading this, guys like you — to get the help we need to tackle binge eating.*

1220,eating_disorders,"I’m 5’5 and ballooned up to 140 in recovery. When I was 103-115 pounds, I was so damn confident. I could get any guy I wanted. Men would fall in LOVE with me. I had boyfriends. I loved my body, despite always being hungry. I never had to wear makeup. When I gained weight, my tummy came back. Most of my weight is in my stomach, boobs (34ddd), and thighs now. My jawline isn’t near as nice as it used to be. I haven’t had a boyfriend in 2 years and I can’t have sex with the lights on. I can’t wear whatever I want anymore and look good in potato sacks like how I used to. The truth is, how your face and body looks matters. Most people, when they look good, have nice bodies, etc they’re confident. People treat them better.

Presently, it’s very difficult to lose weight. I start obsessing over food and getting very hungry every time I try. I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t have the motivation or will power to starve myself anymore. I’m really struggling with my mental health.

1224,eating_disorders,"Alright so i’ve [F17] never been to a doctor about having an eating disorder but do have vague memories of having anna at 7 years old and almost having to go to one. I never gave my parents any answers as to why i never ate so i just slipped a diagnosis. until around 8th grade when i learned healthy eating habits, and have been mostly unrestrictive since, i’m a senior now. Buttt this spring i got a skyla IUD that made me gain 10 lbs so quickly it was like shocking to look at myself, I was the heaviest i’d ever been so my self esteem plummeted and i began to eat less and less and nothing came off. I got it removed bc it gave me hella acne and mood swings, but deep down i also wanted this weight to come off. ALSO the last week i had it my mom commented that i looked so healthy and shouldn’t lose any weight after she made me weigh myself in front of her. she also has disordered eating so i feel like it was back stabby. its been out for a month and i’ve lost 4lbs and haven’t restricted so it came off naturally, and the only reason i know i lost any weight is because my mom looked at my most recent doctor records and brought it up and told me that i needed to do a better job at maintaining weight. Over the last few days i’ve been at home because my car is getting worked on and have been working out and i just feel really weird doing it. i just get flashbacks of when i obsessively worked out and it feels so wrong. The thing is i thjnk about other things thru out the day now and it’s not obsessive but i have vain interests deep down when working out still. I want abs and don’t know why i can’t accept myself as i am right now. that’s why it also feels off. Being home alone all day is a hellish place with my mind.

1225,eating_disorders,"so I’ve been restricting since quarantine started because I was afraid of gaining weight like everyone was talking about, I started out by eating maybe 1200 calories a day and not really caring about counting too much like I’d skip counting days and wouldn’t really care. I’ve been steadily getting more obsessive since then. Now it’s September and I’ve realized I can get Away with eating way less and fasting longer. So I basically just eat breakfast and dinner and a snack if my mom forces me but I lie about eating a snack sometimes. I try to stay under 800 calories a day and then burn off at least 100 by walking so that my net can be 600-700, sometimes I go over that and eat like 1000 calories tho and then I feel bad. People have told me I look different and I’ve been losing weight, I’ve noticed my clothes fit differently and I can wear stuff that used to be too small but that just makes me happy? Like when I can get away with fasting 14 hours without anyone noticing I feel proud? I also body check like evey hour and i feel good knowing I’m eating less then everyone else, it’s weirdly comforting even though I dotn hate my body completely. I’m worried that because I’m not thta hateful towards my body it means I don’t actually have an eating disorder and I’m just faking to make myself more interesting or something, like I want to be sick and hospitalized so that I’m different or whatever? Anyway I’m taking online classes and I keep getting distracted because I’m trying to log my calories for the day or look up recipes to know how much to eat to stay under my limit.

1232,eating_disorders,"So in May this year I decided to start trying to lose weight as I was sick of always feeling so fat. I had seen a YouTube video about intermittent fasting so I decided to try that. At first it was going really well and then I plateaued and stopped losing weight. No matter what I did I was stuck at the same number. So I figured why not cut out lunch everyday and start counting calories. That ended up working and I was losing weight even faster so eventually I decided to cut out breakfast as well and restrict my daily calorie intake. At first it was 1000 calories a day then it went down to 800 then 700 and now I feel disgusting if I eat more than 500 a day. I’m still intermittent fasting so I will only eat for 3/4 hours a day. I start eating at about 5pm and finish around 8.30pm. I allow myself to drink a cup of tea once my fast has ended and then about an hour later I have dinner but I have to make sure I’m eating less than everyone else. I will usually have a small snack after dinner too and until recently I would have a cereal bar or a low calorie desert but now I only let myself eat fruit cos I feel too guilty. 
I thought I was being really healthy and didn’t think anything was wrong with this until I saw a TikTok where some girl said that when she was anorexic she was eating 1200 calories a day and that wasn’t even enough. I’m eating less than half of that. I still feel healthy though and fitnesspal says 1200 is healthy. Also I was talking to my friend about my diet a few weeks ago and she said that I’m starving myself but I feel absolutely fine. If I was starving myself surely I’d have some sort of health issues and I’m fine.
I am 18F 5”2. I started out at 145lbs and I’m now down to 120lbs but honestly I still don’t see a massive difference. I barely see a difference at all in my before and after pics. I still feel so fat. I really want to get down to 100lbs. Once I get down to 100lbs I’ll just start eating a bit more.

hello, I started a food diary yesterday and I don't know if im eating enough. I haven't been diagnosed with an eating disorder but I know I am quite under weight and possibly have on set anorexia. ive been to the doctor about my eating habits but I lied to them and told them im eating a normal amount and have it under control. I don't know where to go to so here I am asking reddit. this is what I have eaten the past two days:

Mon:

medium portion of noodles with chunks of fish, very small portion of Shepards pie and 4 biscuits.

Tue:

same portion of left over Shepards pie, kitkat, curlywerly and a small-mediumism prawn salad and a hand full of nuts.

I'm doing a diary for the whole week these are just the first two days but I know that my diet is quite close to this normally.

I don't ever really have much of an appetite and when ever I eat I always feel very sick after no matter what it is. when I went to see one of my friends I haven't seen in about a month she said how ive lost so much weight, in fact every time ive seen her she's said that but when I saw her about a week ago she showed concern for my weight but when she says these things it doesn't worry me at all, in fact it makes me really happy to know ive been losing weight.

I think there is a problem and im quite worried but I don't want help from the doctor because I feel like they think I'm just saying things for attention. I just need an outside view on my situation.

1242,eating_disorders,"Hi all!


Warning: Long and ramble-y. If you don't want to read my post, my question is basically: I got a very light period a week ago, I feel good about my body, my hunger cues are completely normal, my energy is fantastic, and I don't act on my ED urges, which have gone wayyyyyy down. Both of my parents (who are extremely supportive and have never encouraged ED behaviors) say I seem normal and healthy to them. However, my weight is still 8-10 lbs. lower than my premorbid weight, and 2-3 lbs. lower than what the minimum of what my growth chart would predict for me. Can I expect ED urges to go away 95% when I'm back at my premorbid weight? I'd like to start eating intuitively, as well, to see what would happen, but I'm terrified of relapse. 

I've been doing some research and it seems to me that weight restoration is not an exact science. You kind of have to feel it out, I guess. And this is complicated by the fact that psychological improvement sort of lags behind, and your period doesn't return for a while either sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I feel quite good right now. My hunger cues are totally normal. I don't partake in ED behaviors anymore, even though the urge is still there. My energy's back, and I am, dare I say, happy? I feel like my body looks good (really good, actually. I feel hot.) And my libido is back for the first time in like a year. I got what appeared to be a very light period just a few days ago, but my periods were always light because I have an IUD and they only lasted like two days. However, my weight is lower than it was before I got sick (which was around January this year.) I have suspicions that my weight may have been on the high end for me as I decreased my dosage of ADHD medication two years ago and stopped it altogether one year ago. As these medications suppress appetite, mine came back with a vengeance after 10 years on the medicine. You can see the spike in my growth charts, which is why I question if my premorbid weight was the right weight for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my nutritionist tells me I need to eat three snacks and two desserts a day, even when I've gotten to my healthy weight. She says my body will maintain weight on this. She also says that my ED urges and thought will go away. I feel like if I followed my hunger, I would eat three large meals and two snacks a day and maybe one dessert. 

I do still have a fear of gaining weight, but I'm far more terrified of relapse. I just don't know if it's reasonable to expect that my urges will ever disappear at any weight, as my nutritionist claims. I wish there was a consensus on what the right course of action is.  As it stands right now, whenever it's time for me to eat a snack and I'm not hungry for it, I think ""maybe I should just follow my hunger cues"" but then this is immediately followed by anxiety that not following my doctor's plan to a T will result in relapse. But like...I feel good. If I ate to satisfy hunger and gained weight that would be totally fine with me. I just doubt that my eating disorder will go away at any weight, no matter how high.",,"A few pounds below the weight range my dietician set but I feel very good.

1244,eating_disorders,"From 2003-2009 I struggled with severe eating disorders.
It started when i was about 10, i remember buying jeans in 5th grade which were a size 5. 
A size 5 is small yes, but for a 10 year old girl whose devolping quicker than the rest..i thought i was fat.
So from 10-12 i would ""diet."" 
Eat less and healthy, which i then began fasting..not knowing theb what that was.

My mom was in her mid 20s and my step dad had beat it into her head daily that she was an ugly cow.
All while i was standing close enough to hear the verbal abuse, it rubbed off on me. 
It rubbed off on her to the point of asking me how fat she looked, or just that statement alone ""God, i look so fat.."" 
I'm 13 now and mom is a size 0, and anorexic.
I'm a size 7, it's 2002 and i hate myself.
The summer goes on and on and she leaves my step dad, but the buliema comes with us.
We move and she's so frail.
I hear her forcing food from her stomach into the toilet from my room...
I find her diet tea and laxative and start getting ideas.
If she thinks she's fat, i must be repulsive.

I started my first year of high school at 155 lbs. I looked fine but felt gross in everything i wore, i felt ugly, i felt fat and uncomfortable all. The. Time.  
I was a size 11.
My body didnt look like the other girls..

Beyond my own family unknowingly making me feel this way, every girl in school, on the magazine's, television, myspace etc. We're bone jabbing thin, so thin you could play xylophone on their protruding ribs and i wanted that. It's all I wanted, all the time, and quickly grew into a 6 year obsession.

Now, remember the years here, 2003-2009 was the height of low rise jeans, hip bone tattoos, and the ""no thigh gap"" thing was a craze. 
I never had a thigh gap but at that time it's all i wanted. 
I yearned to be 90-100lbs but my body wasn't made for that.
I was never a thin girl but i was never over weight either. 
All bodies are beautiful, thin and small and inbetween but when i was young n nothing and no one could tell me different.
I was nothing but a number on a scale, and in my mind i felt guilty everytime i took a bite of food.  My whole existence was me obsessing over my weight and comparing me to them.
&amp;Every time I ate, went to the bathroom or made myself throw up- I got on the scale. Or exercise till i could hardly stand.

After every dinner, every snack, or any outing even with friends I would hit the toilet and purge all of the contents in my tummy.
After every school dance i was in the bathroom vomiting.
If i didnt do this, i felt gross

When summer came and i would ride my bike for hours, walked so much it hurt, and in the night id exercise non stop to burn off whatever was left in my stomach. 
I was obsessed with being thin. 
It was all I became.
I wanted to be someone else, but my body wouldn't allow it.
I wanted only water to be in my system, and i was looking up blogs with how to guides for binging and purging, fasting, and tips on starving yourself..

Junior year got out of control.
I had a boyfriend tell me i needed to ""suck the fat from my stomach."" 
I was 135lbs at this point. 
I got so into ""fitness"" i got a most improved award for dropping 20+lbs in personal fitness In gym class.
And altho my mother left my dad, she still had serious issues about how she viewed herself, and felt about herself for the things he had said to her for 10+years.
I don't blame my mom for any of this, nor my dad.
You know who put these ideas into their head?
Our society, the people on the news, magazines, fucking Barbie dolls. 
This was no ones fault but the brainwashing ways of the world.

I last made myself throw up when i was 20. 
I'm 31 now and i can't say I dont struggle with self love, but i have come so fucking far from the shell of a person i was growing up.
And it's been one of the hardest things i pulled out of in my life, but somehow I did it. 
No one even knew this shit about me until about 5 years ago, i was so ashamed and embarrassed.

I haven't been ""actively"" ED for probably close to ten years now, I'm in my late twenties. It shows. I'm skinny fat and my US/CAN dress size is pushing double digits. I live in Canada where lockdowns were pretty intense and I was out of work and so stressed out and overwhelmed and living on my own and it just clicked. Opting out of the grocery store shenanigans is the only way I will feel saner and cleaner.

I was right. I was so right. More right than I knew. I feel like I've come home. Things that didn't fit for years are baggy. My hair's kind of thin and my eyes are hollow, but, fuck it. For reference, I am not censoring but still trying to be mindful of where others are at, and prefer not to throw around numbers, but if you are concerned about my physical safety from the sounds of this, please rest assured my BMI is well within normal and you probably wouldn't assume I was up to anything if you had seen me for the first time. Not that any of this invalidates the danger inherent to these behaviours, I am just not at or even near ""medical intervention"" yet. I haven't posted here before so I wasn't sure if this was necessary to insert, but would rather err on the side of over-explaining given the subject matter than ""FUCK IT, WE'RE UNCENSORED, DEAL.""

My old(?) workplace, which put SO much pressure on me to perform and look perfect all the time, has screwed me over and left me hanging without work even though benefits have ended. I went to visit the other day because I look SO. GOD. DAMN. THIN. and I'm already tall and now my bone structure is popping and with the right concealer you can hardly see the purply eyes.

Everyone looked like shit, as expected, and the people that were the rudest to me before either ran and fucking hid with their leftover spaghetti, or were SO nice and fawning I was low-key wondering uh, is this the same person??

I'd forgotten how powerful even a low-key dramatic weight loss is, and going against the trend of a pandemic, when you are beautiful under the extra padding anyway. They can try to pretend like you're not and you're worthless across the board when you're chub but showing up unexpectedly skinny and lithe and running on empty. 

Oh God it hits so different.

1250,eating_disorders,"Hello, I'm hoping to reach out and find some brave souls who are willing to share their experiences battling Anorexia Nervosa for a play that I am writing to submit to Edinburgh Fringe in 2021 (providing it goes ahead). 

The last thing I want to do is trigger anyone so please only read the following if you feel comfortable enough to do so. 

I myself suffer from BED. It's a fairly new diagnosis and I'm currently undergoing treatment for it. I know what it feels like from my perspective. However, I'm looking for contributions that are specifically based around Anorexia Nervosa or/and Bullimia.

A few years ago a very close friend of mine was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa and was ultimately hospitalised. She is three years 'recovered' now and doing so so so well and I have her blessing to take her story and turn it into a play in order to raise awareness and to express what it truly feels like to suffer from such a horrible illness. I have her side of things to get the word out there. She, like me, is sick of misrepresentation in the media (cough cough To The Bone cough cough) of eating disorders and so we're hoping to get this play performed and published to get the truth out. 

We both think it would be a really nice (?) idea to reach out to other survivors of AN or B and incorporate some of their thoughts and feelings into the play. Those who contribute would do so anonymously and ultimately all experiences would manifest in the main character of the play.

My main focus as a playwright is to accurately portray and represent and I would love if you could have the strength to help make this so.

1251,eating_disorders,"I've struggled with my weight basically since I was 10. I gained a lot of weight rapidly in middle school, and my parents got on me about it. By the time I was 11 I was extremely overweight and my dad freaked out at the pediatricians. Kept saying how bad that is.  Seriously bad.  They start dragging me to run the park (I've never 'exercised' before, im fucking 11). And it was hard obviously. I hated it. I felt like i was dying. My dad pulled me aside and straight up told me i was fat, that i needed to workout and eat better. Otherwise, id have diabetes (like he does). He kept asking ""do you want to shove needles in your stomach every day? Do you want to die of a heart attack at 32?"" Yeah. I was 11. I was scared and confused.  Basically from then on, I never could not look at my weight. I developed depression, which spread to many other areas of my life (anxiety, social insecurities, obsession over my academics, etc). But my weight was the biggest trigger. 

I dont know if it was just me, but being 11-14 and being expected to go on a diet / exercise routine was.... not easy. I didnt know Jack shit about calories, nutrition, etc. I was constantly terrified of my body: I always wore long sleeve jackets, even in the summer, just so no one had to see my body. I kept outgrowing my school dress pants and skirt, but was too scared to ask my parents for another that would fit. 
The scale just kept going up.  I didn't know how to eat (and my family didnt make it easy. They just ate how we normally would, which made it harder for me to ""portion"" control off of that because again, I didn't know how to do that at 11 on my own). My family also made sure i was aware of my eating too, my mom making comments about how big of a slice of cake i was eating, just small things. I remember one time we went to a restaurant and I ordered a filet sandwich, ajd my dad said I could either eat the bun of the sandwich, or throw the bun away and have a milkshake as my ""carb"". I couldnt have both. It was tricky because I still liked food. 

Its always been very difficult for me to hold back on food. It didnt matter if I was stuffed: if something good came to mind, I was going to eat it.  And I literally just ate the entirety of things sometimes. I dont know why its so hard for me to stop and control myself. 

I remember my dad telling me he had a thyroid problem, and he was given medication. But the medication was tricky because if in the wrong dosage, could make you lose way too much weight. He said he dropped an unhealthy amount of weight in a short period of time ans had to stop taking the medication. And i remember hearing this when I was 13 and wanting so badly to have a thyroid issue JUST so I could be issued the medication. I was determined to take it, like a lot of it, because losing a ton of weight so quickly sounded like heaven.  I was so disappointed to never be diagnosed. 

I battled my weight up and down for years, counting calories, crying, forcing myself to workout. I would try extreme measures, like only eating 1/3 of what I normally did, but then pushing myself to burn 3x as much as I could in a day. I would crash and burn and binge and lose all my progress within a couple days. I didn't know anything about nutrition of course. 

I've spent years trying things. My parents tried a diet program which fell apart because it was hard trying to eat those while also going out to dinner with family or eating what they made me instead. I went to a weight trainer who helped me a lot in terms of how to workout effectively. I took weight training and nutrition classes all throughout high-school to learn more. But the overall fear ans consciousness of my weight fell on me every day. Id push myself at the gym for 2 hours every day until I couldn't manage it and would give up. 

I'm 20 now. My weight fluctuates 30 poinds every year for the past 6 years. I will fight myself and steadily gain weight between September and April (the school year) by repeated trials of going to the gym and then lapsing, counting every calorie and then binging, being stressed about my inability to keep on something or rather, still gaining weight despite my periods of trying. And then suddenly just start shedding the fat during the summer when i sit on my ass, sleep till noon, and do no physical activity except mow the lawn once a week. I once went to the gym 6 times a week for 2 weeks, and ate fairly well, and I thought maybe I cojld lose a pound or so, but I ended up gaining 2 pounds. I then tried to go 3 days without eating anything at all (and became depressed when I gave up at 62 hours and ate a PBJ ans chocolate milk ).

My parents also make it a reminder, especially during my ""heavy"" months of the year. Its bad enough when I'm already fighting myself internally over my weight and my eating on a daily basis, but because my parents only see ive gained weight, they take it as me not doing anything about it consciously. So my mom will buy a pair of jeans (and for whatever reason, probably ""hopes"" i lost weight and buys them a size smaller than what I am and have been for years) and these jeans obviously don't fit. Or a tight fitting shirt. And she will say 'its cute. But this would look absolutely stunning... if you just lost a couple of pounds."" Or during winter break (an obvious binge and guilt  period) my mom would see my eating and my body and say ""you have such a fantastic gym at your college! I'm honestly jealous.... promise me you'll go to the gym every single day when you get back to campus?""

I get they want whats best for me, but when I'm already internally stabbing myself with all these thoughts in my head already, hearing it from them too just makes it 10x harder. 

 I have always cried over the scale. Always cried when running out of breath on the treadmill. I cry when I look in the mirror or see a photo of myself. I hate my body and I hate myself. 

I finally live in an apartment this year where I can cook and live on my own. And I was doing REALLY good. Like really good: I've learned so much about nutrition and working out and finding a balance, of what I need and what I can cut. And how to splurge once in a while and treat myself. But I've also made a hqbit of weighing myself daily, tracking every calorie i take in, fretting when the scale goes up 0.5 pounds. Or being worried that i must have tracked wrong when the scale goes up. Its kind of hard to maintain this lifestyle, and I'm starting to plateau at this weight (which i still need to lose some). 

But when I come home during the weekends, and I'm surrounded by all the delicious and fattening foods that I don't allow myself to even buy at my apartment, i lose it. I just eat and snack and whatever, and I think lately it's been worse simply because I've been away from it too long. I'm not even hungry: I see a cake and eat it.  I eat cookie dough from the fridge. I had pancakes and cinnamon buttery loaf. We went to dinner and I was stuffed to the gills but still wanting to eat more ajd more of my potatoes, cake, and bread. 

The scale obviously increases a ton and i feel like I lose a month's progress in just 3 days. 


I started a new job (at a bakery / deli) and even saw my inability to control myself with food. If something is 1 day past expiration. We have to throw it away. But it's perfectly fine still and I end up trying to snack it or take it before it hits the trash. (I actually only started eating ""better because I had a fried cheesestick that was about to go to trash it was like 4 hours old. I had such a bad migraine the rest of my shift, barely made it home because I was swerving all over the highway in pain, feeling like I was passing out. I cake home and threw up. And the next day I just made something healthy and delicious and just stuck with it-- my parents were gone the whole week. So I could actually do shit for myself for once). 


I thought from that experience I would stop snacking at work but the urge is still there and I occasionally still do, despite how disgusting it truly is.

And when my parents came back from that week, and saw I was ""eating healthy"" it was such a big joke. My dad laughed and chuckled to himself when I made a veggie omelet and sliced fruit for breakfast. Kept saying ""let's see how long this will last"". Or we went grocery shopping and I put whole wheat pasta in the cart instead of our regular white pasta and my dad said ""oh my god, whole wheat?????? what is it with this healthy stuff all the sudden??"" (Like its pasta bruh. Seriously)

I get it. I've never been successful in making any long term change. So why should this be different? But its just. A little support would be nice. Just once. Just once. See I'm TRYING and congratulate me, and not make fun of me for it. 
 

But again, i just can't control my food intake. At  my apartment, if something sweet or fatty is available, ill eat it in a heartbeat. No control. Whether im hungry or not. Whether I just had a satisfying meal or not. Whether its 1am or 1pm. 

And at home, again, it's impossible. 

I don't know why I've always had such a hard time resisting food. I don't know if it was jus a coping mechanism for my depression or if there is some underlying eating discover (I don't like to self diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression but even that, my parents were skeptical of, so I am led to believe I shouldn't consider myself ""depressed""--which is a whole othee story of suicidal thoughts and self harm--paetislly due to my weight as well). 

I've never had the strength to talk about my weight or eating to anyone, though, so no one would even know to diagnose anything of that sort. 

So yeah. I dont know if struggling to control myself around food is normal. Or just being extremely overweight and subsequently, obsessing over my weight and my food is natural. 

I've read about eating disorders and learned about them in psychology class and I just assumed I definitely don't have one because I don't meet the severity of symptoms. Like I feel guilty after eating, and though I've considered trying to make myself throw up, I don't/cant. So I feel like that alone shows I just have lack of self control and not an eating disorder (although i genuinely wish i could make myself throw up. If I could do it regularly, i would).

1260,eating_disorders,"I just met my new roommate 2 weeks ago, but I've noticed she has very strange eating habits. Firstly, she told me that she has an autoimmune disease that forces her to be on a special diet. I 100% believe her, and I think her dieting reason is valid, but I think it has caused her to have a bad relationship with food. It's extremely restrictive. I'm talking no high-sugar foods (any fruit), no potatoes, no corn, no diary, no beans, no bread, only coconut oil for cooking. And on top of that, she has decided to become pescatarian for personal reasons. I do want to mention, however, that she will occasionally indulge in foods not on her diet like desserts.

Honestly up to that point, I still didn't see any big problems. But the alarms began to go off the first time she ever made dinner for me. It was some shrimp, asparagus, and broccoli baked in coconut oil. And that doesn't sound too bad, but the portion size was very small, and I went to bed hungry that night (probably because there were hardly any carbs). On top of this, she has become obsessed with intermittent fasting. She only begins eating at 8pm and allows herself to eat until midnight. But even though her dinner is basically her only meal, it is still so small! She is a full time student and works 30 hours a week at her job, and I just don't know how she is surviving on this amount of food. Sometimes she doesn't come home until 9:30pm and only then is she able to eat dinner.

I keep thinking that maybe (hopefully) she snacks when no one is around, but I have a feeling she doesn't. As I said, I've only known her for 2 weeks, so I'm not sure if it's my place to say anything, but she lives very far away from her family and I think I'm the only one in her life who recognizes this.

1263,eating_disorders,"Hi all,

I see so many suffering on here and just wanted to offer up some words of encouragement.

I'm a 48 year old woman, and my eating disorder started when I was 13.  I was going through puberty and got a little chunky and was picked on.  Back in the 80's overweight wasn't common, and I was a bookworm who loved to eat chips and snacks all day!  My mom was constantly on a diet, so I learned to count calories.  I think I restricted to around 1200, but I exercised constantly.  I would take long bike rides, walks, and dance to music in my bedroom.  I lost weight, went from 145 to 125 lbs.  I'm 5'6"".  

But then something happened.  I loved the feeling of control and wanted to see those numbers go down.  By the time I was a senior i weighed 85 lbs.  We lived in a TINY town, so there was no such thing as medical intervention.  I think I finally discovered that wasn't healthy, and I was college-bound.  I started eating a little more.

So then in college I discovered bulimia, except my purging was through excessive exercise and restriction following a binge.  I got up to a healthier weight, but then would fluctuate based on binge/purge cycles.  

I won't bore you with all the details, but know that I have struggled with these tendencies my whole life.  I finally stopped tracking my food a year ago--that was HARD, and it was a gradual process.  Not gonna lie, I still sometimes mentally calculate calories.  After tracking for so long, I can probably tell you the calorie count in everything, as you all know all too well.

What is helping me finally is learning to love myself.  This took so long, I don't want it to take that long for people on here, as I feel the majority of you are quite young.  I try to focus now on what my body can DO, instead of what I look like.  I focus on real food and not so much processed junk.   I'm getting to the age where I need to start thinking about remaining STRONG, not trying to disappear into thinness.  I work out every day, not to burn calories but to feel good.

Bottom line, LOVE yourself.  You ARE worthy.  Try to focus on LOVING your body, not punishing it.  Would you with hold food from your best friend?  NO!  Be good to yourself.  It's a process and it's not going to happen overnight.  But you MUST learn to love yourself first, that is truly the first step.  No one but you can make that happen.

You are all beautiful!  :)",,Encouragement,5,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,iitjzd,1,SweetKassie,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/iitjzd/encouragement/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/iitjzd/encouragement/,1598712349,447,0,0,0,-1,1,Learning to love oneself,helpful,"Focusing on what the body can do, not just appearance, Eating real food instead of processed junk, Working out daily to feel good instead of burning calories, Encouraging others to love themselves and focus on being good to themselves",Learning to love oneself,helpful,"Realizing that focusing on what the body can do instead of what it looks like is helpful, Focusing on eating real food and not processed junk, Working out to feel good, not to burn calories",Learning to love oneself and focusing on what the body can do instead of appearance,helpful,"Improved mindset towards food and exercise, Realizing the importance of self-love and worth"

However, these issues were slowly being resolved as I knew the self-destructive behaviors would eventually lead to a dangerous place and was trying to stop them.

I (f18) have only been dating my boyfriend (m18) for a few months. he wanted to rush into things pretty quickly, and I let him because I liked him a lot. but i immediately realized that a few problems are coming up.

we both have dealt with very similar issues concerning our mental and physical health, such as self harm and eating disorders. personally, i’ve had issues with anorexia and mild bulimic habits over the years. he’s also dealt very heavily with bulimia, but i wasn’t made aware of this until recently.

now, this shouldn’t have had to be a problem. i had been “recovered” for a very long time. although i still struggled with that mindset, i never acted on anything and i was very proud of myself for it. however, about a month ago, my boyfriend made a joke about being bulimic and it was very triggering to me. so of course i brought it up to him, because why would i want to get triggered into going back to that low point, right? also, i just dislike that type of humor.

1270,eating_disorders,"I’ve always been really supportive of my partner voicing his attraction to other people.

I’ve encouraged the glimpses at passing bodies, shared lustful glances across the table - a cheeky grin here and there. 

I think it’s healthy to embrace and understand that we all find ourselves attracted to people outside of our relationship...

I don’t know why I feel so triggered...
I mean, I do know but I’m frustrated that it’s crept up on me, staring me down into a cower. 

I showed him a gorgeous SW on my Instagram feed yesterday... 

She’s flawless.

Lush lipped, cropped hair and a curiously innocent face... you know the type, pale but sun kissed, with the perfect spattering of freckles.

And her body... her body... small bee stung breasts, to match her swollen cherry lips, a tiny waist, lean legs- the thigh gap of my (nightmares) dreams.
Not an ounce of fat in the “wrong” spot, no bulges, no creases, no wrinkles... she’s petite.. shes sexy but cute... she could make an oversized jumper rival my best lingerie set...

She’s perfect.

His face dropped... I’ve never seen him so flawed by anyone, ever.

It was like the image had punched him in the stomach and all that escaped from his cookie pouch was a puff of desperation in the shape of an “oh, my, god”. 
The words slipped out and hung over my head and I stared up at them in severe discomfort. 

Shaken, I attempted to brush it off only to revisit the subject later by discussing the amount of filler in the models face.
I exposed an image of her post needle in an attempt to deter him, hoping he’d snub the paid-for-perfection.

And again... later that evening... 
Not my finest moment(s), not my usual trajectory.

He sat down next to me as I clung to the two images of her side by side... 

“I mean, it’s more than just her face (name)”...
(There, there it was...)

I know he simply stated this sentence in an off hand manner but my brain deliberated over every syllable, committing every nuance until it was(is) burned into my brain.. 

And the voice began, “he thinks she’s beautiful.... he secretly wants someone that petite, you’re too curvaceous, voluptuous... BIG BONED.

He’s stopped drawing you. 

This is why your sex life has died off, this is why you can’t take your shirt off when he tries to touch you, fuck you.

You’re hideous, repugnant... he’s totally repulsed by you... why wouldn’t he be? Why, why, WHY?!

He doesn’t look at you like that...”

Those words, “I’m not with you for the way you look...” ringing incessantly like a geriatrics fucking landline!

I slumped into my seat, I know my mood was visible... it’s like he could hear the screaming in my head.

I told him nothing was wrong, I lied and said I was feeling a bit weird. 

Excusing myself, I headed to the bathroom where I lifted my shirt, exposing the folds of grotesque flesh that cascaded over my pants...
Suddenly that “good-body-day” I was having seemed to melt away.

*You’re just not good enough.*

We’re coming up to our two year anniversary on Tuesday and I feel like the sex has disappeared, I don’t feel like he cares.
I don’t feel attractive anymore...
He frequently triggers my ED... I trigger my ed and yet I can’t seem to fast anymore, I mean I don’t want to but I do... I’ve been in recovery for a few years, (I know, it never goes away) but I feel like I secretly hope this sends me into a 25kg drop... it used to, in old relationships, but I’ve never come this far.

I feel like I can’t control anything any more...

I want to feel like I’m this beautiful person that he stares at longingly.
That my body insights envy in others, that he lusts after me.. that my face could take his breath away- choke him.

But I feel like I’ve stumbled across his dirty little secret... it’s like he’s been holding onto it &amp; now I know!

1273,eating_disorders,"This is going to be very much about me, so sorry if the title seems misleading. 

It's a long post so tldr at the bottom. 

I'm 26/m and have only recently come to terms that I have anorexia. I've been getting therapy for separate reasons recently and have started to get help through the same therapist.

My entire life I've been the tall skinny guy. And I was always proud of that, people would always be telling me how jealous they were of how thin and light I was, and it's well sought out to be a tall male.
This made being the tall skinny guy my identity, if I wasn't the tall skinny guy, I wasn't me.

I'm 6ft2 and around last year managed to get over 10 stone(140lbs)  consistently for the first time in my life. It instantly filled me with dread realising I was slowing no longer becoming the tall skinny guy. It didn't help that my dad would always say 'just wait til your mid twenties, I was just like you then the weight catches up with you'.

To try and control my weight to be no more than 10 stone I started making excuses to skip meals. Suddenly I no longer had time to prepare and eat breakfast before work. This turned to during my lunch breaks I had other things I needed to make sure I got done,  I needed to arrange moving out of my girlfriends parents, I had a car that was breaking down(almost as often as I was!) that needed trips to the garage. The weight of adult responsibility was feeding my anorexia, allowing to to consume my life day by day.

More so recently, I realised to counteract the lack of food during the day with big unhealthy meals. Because I spent most of my day dealing with adult responsibilities, the last thing I wanted to do was prepare proper meals. I would just chuck a tray of chicken nuggets and chips in the oven, cover them in cheese and ketchup and call it a meal.
It tasted great, but left me conscious of my physique still.

For context, I have a super flat chest - literally skin and bones chest, but because of that it accentuates my stomach, making it look 'bulgey'.

Last year my girlfriend left me, for another man, and didn't hold back being open about it. The anxiety, depression and guilt (yes I blame myself for not being good enough for her) left knots in my stomach.
I literally was unable to eat, even when I was so hungry, I couldn't process the thought of putting food in my mouth and swallowing.

My Aunt suggested eating anything that I felt like eating as and when I got hungry, but that lead back to the one meal a day of chicken nuggets and chips, or fast food.

The past few months, I've been living off one meal a day, until maybe the last week or 2. I've been doing everything in my power to avoid eating.

I'll make excuses like, I'm too busy for breakfast, my doctors appointment in the morning over ran so I shouldn't take my lunch break, my flat mate doesn't feel like having the same meal as me so I won't prepare food. Even things like preparing food means having to wash up afterwards and I'm just too busy, and it's not fair to leave the washing up to my flat mate all the time. 

Last night I hit a whole new low when I kept wanting to eat, but a strange sense of pride held me back 'you've made it this far, you've nearly gone an entire day on just coffee'
I made it to bed last night and just felt so depressed that I wouldn't allow myself to eat - I started on a big bar of chocolate and after a few bites felt guilty, but was enjoying it so much. I made it through half the bar before the guilt became too much and I curled up into a ball of regret until I fell asleep.

So now with the long story out the way, the point I wanted to talk about.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm 26/m and feel ridiculous that I'm going through this, I understand its not my fault entirely. But at the same time I feel pathetic, you never hear about people over the age of 18 experience this, and if you do it's few and far between, let alone males experiencing it.
It makes me question the validity of what I'm going through, and what I can do to get past this.

1274,eating_disorders,"i just discovered this subreddit &amp; i’ve been wanting to vent about my frustrations with food. my friends can sometimes be dismissive of it or give terrible advice. i’m not intentionally looking for advice in this post, but if anyone has a similar experience and has any insight i would be interested to know how you are doing!

i used food as comfort from as early as i can remember up until i moved out to college. i would emotionally eat as a child because i experienced trauma from my alcoholic mother &amp; dismissive father, and even after my mom got sober i still ate and ate and ate because i was severely depressed. when i was 18 i was approaching 270lbs and my self esteem was at an all time low. 
3 years ago i moved away from home to start getting my bachelor’s and i liked the independence that came with it. my parents would always buy groceries and it was often unhealthy, processed foods, but since i was living away from home, i was able to make better decisions with my food choices. at first it started out pretty well, with mainly home cooked stuff with normal portion sizes, and i could tell i was losing weight. my depression started to get better, too. it’s not completely gone, i still have my bad days, but i’m no longer hurting myself like i did in high school. 
but then i made a new friend who used a vape, and every now and again she would let me take a few hits from it. i just liked it because the taste was nice, but eventually i developed a nicotine addiction and now, two years later, i’m completely dependent on nicotine to function and i spend more money on pods than i do on groceries. we all know that nic can suppress a person’s appetite, and my weight is continuing to drop because of it. i also got diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and i’m prescribed to take 40mg of adderall per day. the combination of nic and adderall have completely destroyed my appetite, and more often than not i eat no more than a bowl of fruit or some yogurt. i’ve been vegetarian for about a year now so my only sources of protein are through legumes, lentils, and other things but i unfortunately do not eat a lot of those. 
i’ve noticed though that on days where i decide to not take my meds, usually because i have no plans/deadlines, i eat waaaay more than i am used to. the issue with that is that i do not even enjoy food anymore. i don’t know if i’ve ever actually, truly enjoyed food, though. as a kid i would stuff my face with as much food as possible, as quickly as possible, and i never really allowed myself to slow down and savor food. now, it feels like eating is a chore. the only time i eat quickly now is if the nic and adderall has worn off and i can feel how hungry my body is for food, but even then, i don’t enjoy eating. one time my friend and i took some thc-infused candy (we are both of age and in a recreational state) and got some late night munchies, and she made a comment about how i “inhaled” my food. i don’t think she meant anything harmful by it but it made me self conscious about my eating. i usually eat by myself because i don’t want anyone to notice how quickly i eat. 
i do not know how much i weigh now, and i refuse to buy a scale because i know i would become obsessive over it. i just know a general ballpark of where i’m at, and because of how tall i am, my BMI is around 30 which is considered obese. i know that BMI is not an accurate unit for assessing health but it still it doesn’t feel good to be classified as obese. i also often cant even recognize myself in pictures because i envision myself still as the 260+lb depressed 18 year old. 
i just want to be able to eat food, whether it be healthy or something indulgent, without hating myself for it or obsessing over the calories/macros of it. i went from being a human garbage disposal as a kid to becoming a ridiculously picky eater who prefers stimulants over sustenance. i feel like i will never be able to have a healthy relationship with food that doesn’t involve constantly telling myself not to go down a bad road again.
i cant even confide in my friends about my issues with food because they would not be able to believe that i have a dysfunctional eating pattern that’s going to hurt me in the long run. i am not thin by any means, i wear size 14-16 jeans and i usually have to go for large or extra large tops. my physical appearance doesn’t meet society’s expectation of a person with an eating disorder",,my relationship with food has always been terrible,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,iguekk,1,dubbleblended,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/iguekk/my_relationship_with_food_has_always_been_terrible/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/iguekk/my_relationship_with_food_has_always_been_terrible/,1598426507,847,0,0,0,-1,1,"Using food as comfort due to childhood trauma, developing a nicotine addiction, and taking Adderall for ADHD",harmful,"Experiencing a loss of appetite due to nicotine and Adderall, leading to weight loss, Feeling like eating is a chore and not enjoying food, Self-consciousness about eating habits and eating quickly, Difficulty confiding in friends about eating disorder","Using food as comfort due to childhood trauma, developing nicotine addiction, prescribed Adderall for ADHD",harmful,"Depression and self-esteem improved after moving out for college and making better food choices, Developed nicotine addiction which suppresses appetite and causes weight loss, Prescribed Adderall which also suppresses appetite and causes weight loss, Eating has become a chore and is not enjoyable, Self-conscious about eating quickly and eating in front of others","History of emotional eating due to trauma and depression, addiction to nicotine, ADHD medication (Adderall), vegetarian diet with limited protein options, negative self-image, lack of enjoyment in food, difficulty confiding in friends",harmful,"Continued drop in weight due to nicotine and Adderall suppressing appetite, Eating quickly and not enjoying food, Self-consciousness about eating around others, Struggle to have a healthy relationship with food and not obsess over calories/macros"

Nothing is hidden.  
I used to hide in the bathroom for 1 hour to purge and go very eary or late.  
Often also because of L-pill abuse.  
I weighed so so little, but am very fit now.  
I even walked up multiple mountains (intermediate walks) every vacation.  
I don't have this grey lifeless skin.  
I eat, when they are there and don't disappear after.  
I've never cried again when looking in the mirror  
No food has disappeared and I'm saving a lot more money

1277,eating_disorders,I don’t know if this needs a trigger warning or not but I’ll put one here just in case. TW ⚠️ So at the end of May I started trying to lose weight. I’ve always been really insecure about my weight so I decided it was finally time. I had heard about intermittent fasting and so wanted to try that out and also was trying to eat in a calorie deficit. It started out really healthy and then I started to restrict my calories a lot more. I didn’t think there was anything wrong with this until my friend told me that I was starving myself and I wasn’t eating enough. To be completely honest I still don’t see an issue. I’ve been eating about 500 calories a day for the past 3 months and I am completely fine. It’s also still taking me really long to lose weight. I do get quite scared to eat anything with over 200 calories and I always plan out what I’m gonna eat because I can only eat a certain amount a day but I still look and feel just as fat as before. According the the scales I have lost 20lbs but I don’t see it at all. Also I feel like that’s barely any weight loss in like 3 months. So many other people have lost a lot more in a shorter amount of time. So my question is is this disordered eating? Is there anything wrong with this? I feel fine so I don’t see the issue.

1279,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone,

I just want to get some advice and opinions on what's it like to be hospitalised for anorexia? I saw my GP today and she is worried since my weight has dropped even more from my last visit with her and suggested that I may need to be hospitalised but I really do not want to be. I honestly cannot think of anything worse than that. Can they involuntarily admit me? Or is it something I get the choice to do? If anyone has been hospitalised what is it like in there and what are you forced to do? Sorry for all the questions but I would like to know what I may be getting myself into if I don't make changes now.

1281,eating_disorders,"I'm currently a 23 yr old female that has struggled with eating disorders from age 11 or 12. I discovered pro-ana sites and was fascinated by restricted eating. this mostly had to do with my abusive perfectionist mother who made fun of my natural pot belly and made me start working out at age 10. My father was also not in my life until age 10, where he developed his own eating disorder and was obsessed with ""clean eating"". sometimes I would starve with him.

by age 13 I think I was bulimic but not necessarily due to wanting to lose weight but I loved the feeling of purging. I did that every night in the shower and even when my parents discovered it they did nothing. I was still praised for losing weight.

by age 15 I moved to a new school and met a girl who was clearly up to no good. through her I discovered losing weight by using meth. I used until I was about 18, and was still bulimic.

at age 18 I stopped cold turkey. I've rarely made myself throw up since then and its only been due to being drunk or sickness. at this point I've lost about 50 or 60 pounds overall and I now hate how frail I look. It's obvious I've lost weight fast and unhealthy, and now my relationship with food sucks. I have to force myself to eat most of the time and I have developed severe gastritis from my eating patterns.

1282,eating_disorders,"I'm not really sure if I have an eating disorder, but I'm worried I do.

For the past \~4 years I've had a lot of body dysmorphia (specifically about my stomach fat). I'm a healthy BMI right now (\~21) and so I should be okay with my body, but every time I think about my stomach &amp; look at myself in the mirror it makes me really upset.

There are a few reasons I think I have an eating disorder, or at least practice disordered eating.

1. I spend all my time thinking about food/my body. When I'm not actively doing something else (watching a TV show, hanging out with friends) the only thing I think about it what I've been eating, my weight, and how I look. Even when I'm doing other things, these thoughts pop into my head and I can't get rid of them. Like I'll be going on a walk with some friends and see my reflection in a window and think about how fat I am (even though I KNOW that I'm not actually fat). And when I'm watching a TV show I'll open my diet tracker app and obsess over the numbers, think about how I'm going to keep my daily calories under control, etc.
2. I don't eat very well. By this I mean that I swing between dieting (always through calorie restriction) and binge eating. I'll go maybe two months eating whatever I want whenever I want, often more than 5000 calories a day, which is a lot for my height (153cm). I always feel guilty about those days, and basically go to bed feeling guilty and miserable for eating so much. Then I'll decide to download a food/weight tracker and try to lose weight, basically by eating as little as I think is healthy. The problem is that I'm not sure what's healthy. I exercise a lot (for the sole sake of burning calories/weight loss) but I'm also pretty short. The calorie counter says I should be eating 1800 calories a day for weight maintenance. When I'm 'dieting' AKA trying to lose weight, I aim for 900-1000 calories a day. Everything online says this is too low but I'm so short, I feel like the 'average' recommended stuff can't really apply. And I don't really have trouble with eating that much; I can often go a day eating only 600-700 calories and then have to eat a bar or something to get my calories up to 'healthy.'
3. Basically, I obsess over numbers, both my calorie intake and my weight. It makes me feel good when I lose weight or don't eat a lot in a day, and I constantly weight myself/check how much I've eaten in a day to make sure I don't gain weight.
4. I make excuses to not eat. I rarely eat breakfast (checking my meal tracker, I've had breakfast 3 days the past 3 weeks). But this is because I do the whole intermittent fasting thing. It doesn't feel like I'm skipping a meal in an unhealthy way, but I do it to lower my daily calories. I sometimes pretend my stomach hurts or I'm nauseous to that people around me don't ask why I'm not eating a lot for dinner. Sometimes I go to sleep early so that I don't eat a lot at night.
5. I probably exercise too much. I know this isn't a traditionally bad thing, and if anything it's usually seen as good, but I only exercise to lose weight and not to like, get stronger or increase my stamina or something. It's just a means to get to my target weight. (Which is 43kgs/95lbs, BMI of 18.4). I always make sure that I stay hydrated, but I'll often do 30-45 minutes of HIIT every day with 30-45 minutes of cardio after, with no rest days in between. The thing is that it doesn't make me sore or in pain, so it doesn't feel like I'm hurting myself, but I also still only eat \~1000 calories a day while doing this. I can't tell if I'm being 'healthy' and exercising and dieting, or if I'm pushing myself too much. I think it's probably not healthy but I honestly can't tell.
6. I rationalize my habits. With my restricted calories, I tell myself that 1000 isn't that much lower than 1200, which is the lower limit for an average person my age, and I'm also much shorter than average so my RDI should be lower, and I'm trying to lose weight anyways. I tell myself my exercising is healthy because it makes me stronger and more toned, even if I know that I'm probably doing more than I should be, and not eating more to compensate. And I'm a healthy weight and my target weight isn't that far 'underweight.' If anything, the standards set for people like me (asian women) say that I should be aiming for 1kg/2lbs lower than I am. But I also know that a lot of asian beauty standards are unhealthy and promote eating disorders. I don't know what to think any more.
7. I've been bulimic in the past. Not often and I hated myself after purging, but I've forced myself to purge after binge eating a couple times in the past. Not sure if this means I'm already predisposed to having an eating disorder/have had one in the past. But I haven't purged in over two years.

Reasons I might not have an eating disorder are the following.

1. I don't feel uncomfortable when people watch me eat. I have no problem with people seeing me eat, and I don't try to hide my eating. I know for a lot of eating disorders, a symptom is being uncomfortable with people watching you eat. This doesn't affect me.
2. I don't really restrict what kind of things I eat. I avoid bread/pasta/rice because of their high caloric density, but pretty much anything else I'm fine with eating. For example, I eat candy a lot, as long as eating it doesn't push me over my daily calorie limit. I eat tons of frozen fruit and snacks too. So I'm not really dieting, I'm just counting.
3. I don't get any physical symptoms. Aside from occasionally getting cold fingertips/toes in the morning if I haven't eaten in 16+ hours, I don't notice any negative physical symptoms. If anything, I usually see good things; I gain muscle from all the exercise I do, and I lose weight because of my calorie counting/exercise.
4. I don't talk about feeling fat. I know it's a weird thing but like I've never had an urge to express my feelings of discomfort with my body. It's an inward thing. When people tell me I'm not fat I accept it, and I know that they're telling their truth. So I don't know if what I'm struggling with is just a body image issue and not an eating disorder.

Basically, at the end of the day, I can't tell if I'm being healthy and having strong willpower, or perpetuating an eating disorder. I don't feel unhealthy and there are a lot of physical symptoms of eating disorders that I don't have, but a lot of behavioural red flags seem to be dead on. (Mostly obsession with weight, appearance, calorie counting, etc).

I've never talked to a therapist about this. I don't even know what I'd say. I probably wouldn't change my behaviour, to be honest, because I do make sure I'm staying relatively physically healthy and I really want to hit my goal weight. But I'm also engaging in activities I would never encourage someone else to do. I guess I'm just wondering: even if I do have an eating disorder, am I high-functioning enough that it's not actually negative, and doesn't need to be worked on? I've done therapy before and really hated it, so I'd really rather not start it again if I can avoid it.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis. I'm just really really seeking clarification about whether my behaviour is indicative of disordered eating, and if it should be changed, or if I'm just in my head about it.",,Do I have a disorder?,3,,tw: numbers,,,,t5_2zzq8,if7s6u,1,paperworlds,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/if7s6u/do_i_have_a_disorder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/if7s6u/do_i_have_a_disorder/,1598205460,1368,0,0,1,-1,1,"Obsession with weight, appearance, and calorie counting",harmful,"Swings between dieting and binge eating, Exercises excessively and only for weight loss, Rationalizes habits and makes excuses to not eat, Previously struggled with bulimia","Obsessive thoughts about food and body, swinging between calorie restriction and binge eating, excessive exercise, making excuses to not eat, rationalizing behaviors",unknown,"Frequent negative thoughts and feelings about their body and weight, Difficulty determining what is a healthy amount of food and exercise, Engaging in activities that are not encouraged for others, Difficulty determining if their behavior is healthy or indicative of disordered eating","Obsession with weight, appearance, and calorie counting; restriction and binge eating cycles; excessive exercise",unknown,"The writer is experiencing a lot of body dysmorphia, The writer is engaging in disordered eating habits and has a history of bulimia, The writer is rationalizing their habits and is unsure if they have an eating disorder, The writer has not sought professional help"
1283,eating_disorders,"1. I had to eat tomatoes for breakfast (at noon today) because I could not mentally handle anything else and I would run the risk of passing out or becoming even more weak than I already feel and nauseous if I did not try to eat anything, which would prevent me from eating “normally” for the rest of the day sending me into day or week long cycles of starvation, exhaustion, and depression due to physical and mental fatigue. I am still trying to eat more tomatoes and it is now 1;30 pm.


2. I frequently cry before or during meals in order to relieve the overwhelming tension and anxiety I have about having to force myself to eat and to gain the confidence to eat at all 


3. I frequently take two hours or more to eat a “meal” that I do not even fully get through and it often takes me two hours or more to prepare that meal as well because I can’t sit still, or be around the food comfortably for an extended period of time. 


4. I am on a physical and emotional roller coaster hour to hour and minute to minute of the day because I do not know if I am okay or not (am I going to pass out, Will this make me throw up, whats wrong me with that I can’t eat this, I can hardly stand up, I feel like I’m forcing food down my throat and it’s not even going down) 


5. Mealtimes, restaurants are ruined for me and the people around me (mostly my boyfriend) because I have a total inability to feel comfortable eating in a “rushed” or “pressured” setting (I.e when meals are expected to only last a certain amount of time and the people around me openly enjoy it and clean their plates) It makes me jealous and miserable at the same time. 


6. There have been times where I binge eat to the point where my stomach feels like it’s going to explode. 


7. My relationship with food and eating is heavily tied to my moods (volatile daily), emotions, and well-being. 


8. I have lost and will continue to lose hundreds of dollars to food that I waste, or buy just for the pretense of looking like a normal person.


9. I fixate on certain foods and will obsess about eating that food as much as possible for a period of time (for example, two winters ago I was getting 32 Oz or sometimes 64 Oz of boiled peanuts a day for weeks on end and subsisting on them) 


10. I don’t like that my body looks like a weak child because I can’t take care of myself and I can no longer accept this version of myself and be okay with it anymore 


11. I sometimes use liquids or alcohol to try to fill the empty space in my stomach and body. 



This is my life daily and has been for many many years (around 7 or 8). I can no longer live like this as it is driving me into an even deeper and escalating depression and I am scared for my life, the quality of it, and my future, which at this time seems extremely bleak because all I can see is more of the same if I don’t ask for help.

Edit to add that while I only eat while hungry, I dont ALWAYS eat when I'm hungry, and some examples of meals I find completely fine for a whole day include: some peanut butter, Some grapes, a chicken breast, a small amount of something.

If I go over the threshold, I always increase my workouts just to burn it all away. The second part of the cycle is the binging. After a week or so I give in and just binge on whatever I can find. Usually I average to 3000 or so calories and I always feel guilty afterwards but once I start I just say ""F it the damage is already done"". Through this I've seen my weight fluctuate a lot. I reached my goal weight only to want more and continue restricting, and through binging I always gain the weight back and thus the cycle continues. I'm scared to tell my family.

1287,eating_disorders,"This is my (25f) first ever reddit post and I am hoping anyone can lend some insight! 

I struggle deeply with feeding myself appropriately throughout the day. It’s not that I do this on purpose, or for any specific reason, I really have no idea why I do it. I’m not worried about my weight. I am fairly okay with my body. I would like to be more toned and muscular but, I know that in order to get to that I will need to workout, but I don’t commit to working out because I don’t feel like my current calorie intake would allow me to get a good workout in. 

A day in the life:
I wake up around 6:30, shower &amp; get ready, leave the house with having (maybe) consumed some lemon water with plans to eat breakfast at the office. Sometimes I will eat breakfast @ the office before 9am but some days I’m busy or just can’t be bothered to leave my desk and then all of a sudden it’s lunch hour and I haven’t eaten anything all day. So, for lunch, sometimes I bring something but on the days I don’t, I’ll likely skip it. Sometimes I’ll grab some fast food but recently got very sick from fast food and am trying to eliminate it completely. Then all of a sudden it’s 4pm and time to go home and all I have consumed is (maybe) a bagel/avo toast/small burrito. Dinner is a hard meal for me because my boyfriend and I have different diets and don’t always cook/share a meal together and I struggle with “what sounds good” or knowing what to prepare for myself. I get discouraged because I hate wasting food and so many recipes are made for 2+ people and a lot of times I am extremely grossed out by leftovers so.... 

I don’t know! I need help! I’ve worked with a therapist and it honestly didn’t help too much with the eating thing. It’s the weirdest thing. I know I need to eat and need food/fuel to survive but my brain cannot make that connection and take it seriously/plan accordingly and actually feed myself.

1288,eating_disorders,"I (F25) have been with my boyfriend (M28) for a little over a year and a half. When we met I was about 8 months into recovery and doing really well. I told him briefly about my struggles with EDs over the years, but said I wasn't ready to talk about it in depth. I had been doing well in recovery on my own and while I had the odd bad day or week, I was really on top of it.

Then lockdown happened, I lost my job and was isolated away from my family, friends and my partner. So much change at once suddenly made my ED very confronting and I fought the thoughts for a couple of months before spiraling for a little while. I am currently struggling with facing getting back to a healthy weight. 

With lockdown easing in my area I've finally been able to see friends and family again a few of whom have commented on my weight, including my boyfriend. Usually he never would and is incredibly respectful but he said he wanted to check I was ok. I feel so torn. On the one hand he is the person I trust most and if I was going to open up to anyone it would be him, but I'm so fearful of it changing our relationship or how he sees me. I feel like it's my responsibility to dig myself out of this ED hole but at the moment it's just so hard to see a way out on my own.

Has anyone had to admit they're struggling and ask for help from a partner? We've been unable to see each other for months so the days we get together I'm desperate for them to be good and happy. Do you have any tips for how to have the conversation and not let it become a 'thing'?

&amp;#x200B;

I (f19) have been with my boyfriend for almost two years. When we met I was recovering from bulimia and anorexia. I was doing very well, and I was a healthy weight. My relationship with food was even getting better.

He helped a lot in the beginning. But a around 5 months ago my cycle of dieting started. I recognized immediately that dieting is generally how both of my ED's began. I continued anyways, for various reasons.

I think one of the biggest reasons is my boyfriend and I'll try to explain the best I can. I had a lot of problems in the beginning with his ex girlfriend. Him &amp; I both were struggling with her as she was crazy, and constantly tried to harass us and cause problems. She would drive by his house, she even broke in one day, she'd make new social media accounts to beg him or me to meet up with her for ""closure"".

I never understood why she acted that way until I finally did talk to her and she explained. He pretty much emotionally cheated and tried to physically cheat as well. He started talking to this other girl he was close friends with and began asking for threesomes and would compliment and fantasize about this girl.

So they broke up when she found the messages because he couldn't deal with the confrontation. They kept sleeping together for months until he met me, and we began dating. I immediately felt embarrassed after seeing his ex. She's like, 5'2 120 lbs, and petite in all the right places. She's tan, and has long thick hair. The reason I mention this is because even after I began starving myself, my body has never been perfectly petite or proportioned. I just wasn't my boyfriend's type at all, and that hurt. I questioned a lot why he was/is with me until I just gave it up.

What really pushed it over the edge was him meeting up and seeing his ex behind my back once, which she promptly told me about afterwards. We almost broke up, and my mental health was complete shit.

So, besides that, I began trying to continue developing a healthy relationship with food. I stopped eating only one meal a day, and went to two or even three and snacks! I was so proud. I would even let myself snack while making dinner. This is when the comments from my boyfriend started. He would tell me to ""slow down"" while eating (I'm not a fast eater). He would tell me not to eat something before dinner or while cooking even if I knew I would still be hungry for dinner.

I just brushed those comments off. Lately, I've been eating a lot and have put on a few pounds. Which, in itself, is pretty triggering and absolutely shot my mental health into the gutter. It's nothing noticeable, just 2-3 lbs of mostly bloat. But I have been covering my stomach more and etc.

My boyfriend is really into tiny girls, and maybe this is why this comment was so upsetting to me. Today, in the car, he had his hand on my thigh. I pointed out that his hand was the size of my thigh, and laughed. He didn't laugh and just said he had big hands and I just had big thighs. I thought I heard him wrong, so I said, ""do I have big thighs?"" I think he realized what he said and just shrugged. I was so hurt though.. His type of girl is not me, even from the beginning. In the end, I think this realization and relationship is just really hurting my progress. I'm still underweight, and yet I want to lose more and he's encouraging it. I don't know what to do, and I'm sorry this is long. I just don't really have friends and I'm really discouraged right now.",,My boyfriend is making my eating disorder worse.,20,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,i9z4c3,1,throwaway-94589485,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/i9z4c3/my_boyfriend_is_making_my_eating_disorder_worse/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/i9z4c3/my_boyfriend_is_making_my_eating_disorder_worse/,1597456699,656,0,0,0,-1,1,"Boyfriend making negative comments about the writer's eating habits and body, and encouraging her to lose weight despite being underweight",harmful,"Triggering the writer's eating disorder and causing her mental health to deteriorate, Making the writer feel insecure about her body and question her worth in the relationship","Boyfriend making negative comments about her eating habits and body image, boyfriend preferring a different body type than hers",harmful,"Triggering her eating disorder, Causing her mental health to deteriorate",,,

I have made some big strides: I dont use the scale, I dont follow weight loss media, I deleted all calorie tracking apps from my phone. I am reclaiming hunger cues, buying clothes in my current size (as to say that I am happy at this size and will invest in it), and eating what I want, including triggering foods that I used to restrict. I exercise for the sun and the endorphins, and dont track anything besides time spent.


That's all good and happy.


But recently money has been tight. I havent been drinking alcohol/smoking weed, I have been eating frugal meals, and biking instead of driving.


All my clothes are looser. I'm really upset. I feel panicked.


Immediately I fell back into that horrible mindset of obsessing over weight. I started thinking about dieting, planning my days around it, imagining myself at my ""ideal weight."" I started looking for a scale, was about to download a weight loss app, was ignoring hunger cues, etc. It's bad. It's real bad.


Part of me feels like I have achieved something that I need to protect with my life. Something I can lose at any second. I feel vulnerable. I am scared to put the weight back on, but I think eventually I'm going to. I'm trying to prep myself for that, but it is hard.


I also feel scared. I'm scared that I didnt lose the weight in a healthy way. I feel scared that I lost weight without control and intent. That's not how it has ever happened.


*TW* SA
I'm also scared because when I was at my smallest I went through SA. Being thin is a trigger. I gained a shit ton of weight after that happened. What would happen is I would eat and eat and think, ""I need to gain weight. I need to be invisible.""


I am swinging from both extremes right now. From ""I need to lose weight to be loved"" to ""I need to gain weight to be safe."" The latter is the one I see coming in from the distance. I don't want to go there again. I havent binged in so long.


Now nothing feels simple or safe. I went for a walk to clear my head, and all I could think was, ""Am I really doing this to clear my head? Or am I doing this to burn calories? Am I going back into my ED?""


I also feel bad because I know healthy people wont understand. My mom would say ""Isn't this what you want?! Stop complaining about the weight of your diamonds."" I feel guilty over my struggle with this.

1301,eating_disorders,"This will be long. I just need to get it off my chest.

I've struggled with anorexia since I was five years old, when I first started restricting, throwing food away and lying about it, chew&amp;spit, etc. That was nearly 30 years ago. I spent most of my teens twenties with a BMI of about 16, sometimes lower. My wedding dress, a directly off the runway sample size, had to be taken in 3 times before my wedding. When I'm stressed, I starve, and well...I stress often. I've had 3 children, and not only could I not breastfeed any of them because my bodyfat was too low, I also lost bone mass with each pregnancy. So, sure, it's been a struggle. And every time I think I've found a balance, some semblance of contentment with myself, there's some trigger and I fall down the rabbit hole again.

I had my third child a year ago. In July, I weighed 140lbs, 10 more than my prepregnancy weight. That may sound like a large number for an anorectic, but I'm 5'11"", so 140 is a size 2 on me. I was more or less okay here. I felt fit, was working out every day, walking/hiking every day. Feeling pretty decent, and though I'll never love myself, I didn't entirely hate myself.

And then I caught the coronavirus. We've been so careful. I haven't seen anybody out of our household since February. I only go to the grocery store and for walks, and I obsessively wash and sanitize. Always have my mask on out of the house. Still managed to get it. Of course, I quarantined in the bedroom to try to keep my family from getting sick. Did not leave the room for over a week. Didn't play with my children, couldn't snuggle my baby, couldn't touch my husband. He brought anything I needed to the room and quickly left. I stayed in bed a lot, slept loads. No appetite. None. Funny enough, I never lost my sense of smell or taste. Just no desire for food. I ate once a day, because I knew I absolutely had to. A cup of soup and two pieces of toast. Every single day. For nine days. 

When I started to feel better and could leave the room, on a whim, I decided to look at the soup box my husband had been purchasing. 170 calories per serving. Plus toast. I estimated that I was getting about 500 calories a day while fighting a virus. Which is probably why I lost over 5lbs in a week...

I love it. I was so incredibly happy to see the number on the scale. And I thought, well I still don't feel great. I still don't feel like eating. Why not continue? That's exactly what I'm doing now. Ten more pounds. I've promised myself I'll stop at ten. In fact I'll only do five more and assess from there.

But let's be real. I'm lying. Because this always happens. There's always a reason, always an excuse, and I find myself willingly falling down the rabbit hole again. I will always be Alice.

1302,eating_disorders,"Hi there. I am 18 years old, and had anorexia nervosa for about a year between the ages of 16-17. I live in the United Kingdom, and despite my issues I still went to college all throughout first and second year. I have a long history of negative body thoughts. Like a lot of people’s origin of body dysmorphia, I was suggested to loose weight at age 10 which caused me to completely obsess on looking attractive and not being fat. Since then, through years of trying to persuade my mum to buy me diet pills, doing water fasts, etc. I would say I am mentally in a way better place currently, in regards to destroying my body.

I am finally comfortable enough with my body (despite being 6’3 and slightly still underweight) to pursue being properly healthy. I smoke cigarettes and have done for 2 1/2 years. I smoke weed on occasion, and am pretty much drug free these days, rarely do powders which i think is good as i used to use them too often.

My main concerns are my circulation, my skin, and my bones. I eat fairly healthy, but not a balanced diet due to accessibility to a shop that isn’t a shitty McColls. I probably eat oven pizza twice a week and not enough vegetables. My legs and feet are pretty much always red or hot, especially after eating. my skin is pale, and i have a blotchy skin tone all over my body, slightly grey and red. 

Im planning this september to properly quit smoking, and rejoin the gym and do more cardio to improve circulation, but if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it. I just don’t really know what to do, as 70% of my friends smoke more than me, eat unhealthy, and yet i feel it is affecting my day to day body way more than them, and I wish it didn’t. I just want nice skin. I don’t want to look sick anymore, I have overcome so much.

I haven’t wanted to tell my family because they all struggle with body image and I didn’t want the questions, but everyone has noticed that I lost a lot of weight. I try not to weigh myself much, usually once every couple weeks since March and I’ve been losing on average about 5 pounds every two weeks. Last time I checked the scale, which was yesterday I was the same weight as two weeks ago. not only that, but this week I have been so unbelievably bloated and my stomach is impossible to suck in. I’ve been seriously spiraling because I feel like I’m being punished in someway. I basically gave up eating for the past five months just for my body to randomly betray me and start uncontrollably bloating Even when I’m doing everything the same. I spent an hour having a nervous break down this morning because I just don’t understand why this is happening.

1304,eating_disorders,"Just posting this because I feel like I'm going crazy and wondering if anyone can relate. Quarantine has made my ED flare up. I'm super sad, which has left me with a decreased appetite, and then I restrict to try to make myself feel better (I guess my thought is, ""I may be sad and alone, but at least I can lose weight."") Obviously, it doesn't really help, but it is pretty comforting. It is also SOO easy to do so because I'm 1) alone and 2) home all day. My family doesn't eat together much, so it's pretty easy to restrict without anyone noticing, which is nice, but it also makes me feel a bit sad that I'm not spending enough time with anyone for them to notice the changes. 

I started cooking at the beginning of quarantine, and have continued to do so and enjoy it so much, but have gotten to the point where I can barely enjoy the meals I make (I cook for my whole family, and still enjoy the act of doing it, but really miss enjoying/wanting to eat the food.) My appetite has been really really poor lately which makes me feel sad and exhausted and kinda like I'm losing my mind. I barely want to eat anything, but I realized recently that I enjoy really basic foods that are high in sodium, so I got some top ramen, and eating that made me feel good and somewhat normal. I don't know why I'm writing this, I'm just so sad. I miss enjoying food, but I also feel that I don't deserve to eat it. 

I had one of my first meals with people outside of my family tonight and it was tough. When I served myself, I felt like my plate was full, and I knew that it was more food than I would want or normally eat, but when I looked around I realized I had so much less than everyone else. I had to pace my eating during the meal as to not finish way before anyone else. My friend's mom served everyone dessert, and not being able to pick my own portion obviously freaked me out. People joked about how little of it I ate, but I'm not really a sweets person, so I didn't feel too uncomfortable about it. I think the being alone aspect of all this is difficult. I've really come to feel like my behaviors and eating are normal because I'm just not around other people, but they're not. I am so sad, and lonely, and miss enjoying food, but I also feel that restricting is one of the few comforts I have right now. I'm not really looking for advice I just needed to vent.

1307,eating_disorders,"Hi friends,

I have never posted on any type of internet forum before, but I am too scared to talk about this with family/friends/therapists/medical team members for fear of being sent back to treatment. I am an almost-30 year old medical provider myself, and I understand the importance in speaking with a medical professional and not going on the internet for medical advice- I condemn my patients for this on the reg. I am just hoping someone here has some medical understanding of how eating disorders affect the human body and can give me some advice anonymously, or perhaps lead me to someone who might be able to help. 

I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa 1.5 years ago- spent 7 days in the hospital because I was bradycardic and then spent 3 months in treatment. At rest, my lowest HR during sleep was 35, and it was mostly in the 40s-50s during the day while I was up. No symptoms other than GI issues (which is what brought be to the doctor's office in the first place), no abnormal labs, BP was totally stable, no dysrhythmias. My eating disorder had developed over the course of 6 months (so not something I've been living with for long). In that time, I had started running 2-3 miles daily (never was a runner before), and was restricting calories to anywhere from 1,000-1,500 per day. Lost 40lbs over 6 months, and noticed very quickly into it that my resting HR was in the 30s/low 40s. It probably only took 1-2 months to develop this severity of bradycardia, and at that point I had only lost about 10lbs and was at a stable BMI. I thought it was so fascinating but (even as a medical provider myself) didn't see anything dangerous or wrong with it since I had no symptoms and felt great. I figured I was in the greatest shape of my life.  

Fast track to after treatment, I was fully weight restored, and HR was back to normal (resting in the 70s). As soon as I came out of treatment, I probably dropped 15lbs in 1-2 months. I've been stable at this weight now for over 1 year and actually feel like I have found a good balance. I am not underweight, I work out regularly but not obsessively, and I eat 3 meals/2 snacks a day (probably average 1,600-1,700 cal per day) which I DO understand is not enough, but I've been maintaining at this number for a while so I feel okay. From the outside, everything seems fine. 

But the truth is, I am bradycardic again- and have been for maybe 10 months. I am hiding my bradycardia from everyone. At rest, I am usually in the low 40s, sometimes the high 30s. When I am moving around during the day (not exercising), I am in the 50s-70s. Absolutely no symptoms. Everything else is normal. 

I just wonder why I am so seemingly stable yet my HR is so low. Is this going to be harmful over time? It seems that it doesn't take much in a change in exercise/diet to bring my heart rate that low, since this happened just a month or so into starting my ED habits (and at a point where I really hadn't lost much weight). Am I being stupid for not telling my doctor? I know that you're all going to tell me to talk to my doctor right away, but I feel convinced that, since everything else is stable (medically and emotionally), I don't want to see someone and have that number freak them out and trigger them to send me straight back to treatment. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

1309,eating_disorders,"It was around 10th grade when I realised I don't like how I look. I used to be a skinny kid, but I guess my metabolism sucks because I started gaining weight when I turned thirteen even though nothing in my diet changed.

11th grade, we moved, my mom worked abroad and my dad was always busy, so my and my sister always ate alone. I took this as a chance to loose weight and avoided eating dinner. It worked, I lost weight and for a moment I was happy, but then I wasn't satisfied with it anymore. I had this classmate who was skinnier than most people in class, but not too skinny, so I decided that my goal was to be as skinny as her. So I avoided eating dinner and lunch, only eating biscuits when I'm hungry.

11th grade ended, and my weight did not change that much, only losing a few pounds here and there and then gaining it back for some reasons. I didn't know what i was doing wrong, so I researched. Then I discovered the world of calories and calorie counting. Apparently, the biscuits that I eat had tons of calories, therefore I wasn't really losing weight (because Im lazy as sh*t so I don't exercise). Not eating wasn't enough if some foods that I do eat had a lot of calories, therefore I ended up downloading an app to keep track of how many calories I've already intaked.

And it worked, my first goal was 1200, but then I started reading anorexia forums where I discovered that most eat calories lower than 500. So I thought, Imma do that as well. Although, I still have weakness around food, thus I can only reach around 900 calories a day. I decided I'll just stick to 900, because I'm still human, I still get hungry, and besides it's still lower than the required calories people needs to intake everyday.

At this point a lot of my relatives were noticing my weight. Keep in mind that I only used to be a skinny kid, when I turned thirteen my weight was around 54kg with the height of 5ft flat. So when when me and my twin sister visited them due to the holidays (both my parents were not with us because it's a long family drama that's still going on until now) my cousin forced me to stand on a scale. I was 39 kg.

Now, I know that that's a really low number for a weight, but considering that I'm small for my age, I don't think i was that thin. But they panicked, so they told our mom. The thing is, our mom was already scheduled to come home that year, but when she heard the news, she went home a lot earlier.  Long story short, mom and dad joined forces to feed me.

They assumed I was anorexic. I was never diagnosed, and honestly, I never reached the part where bones where obviously protuding out from me. I think they just noticed my drastic weight loss because they were so used to seeing me with a little fat. I had belly fat, thighs that touch all the freaking time, and most of my shirt sleeves were always about to pop off due to my huge arms.

I mean, I was going to stop starving myself when I reached my weight goal. 

Right now, the last time i checked, my weight was 45kg and my parents are making sure it won't drop any lower than that. Every family gathering, I was always that person that was anorexic, so everyone and their mother was always watching over me, always telling me to eat or something.

1313,eating_disorders,"Need a place to vent because this issue causes me a lot of anger and stress for which I have no outlet at home.

My mother has had a binge eating disorder since she was young and has struggled with being overweight for most of her life. This is the tip of the iceberg, but to summarize, she has a long, unhealthy relationship with food that has given me my own body image and food issues.

It's been a large cause of sadness and insecurity for her for my entire life. I have memories from my early childhood of her crying over her weight when she thought she was alone, measuring out tiny portions of food at breakfast when she was ""on track,"" and seeing her gorging on fast food in her car before coming inside after work. During periods of weight gain she would try on her clothes, fail to fit into them, and say awful things about herself. ""I'm a whale, I can't fit into my clothes, I'm embarrassed to go out like this,"" etc. When I was young I'd fixate on the things she'd say about herself, and cry knowing that my mom, with whom I've always been very close and was very attached to as a kid, was so miserable in her own skin.

Her binging and weight problems are things we don't talk about, because it's such a source of shame for her that she avoids the conversation, and I don't want to force it on her by insisting we discuss it. It's uncomfortable, and I know she feels a lot of guilt and embarrassment.

The disordered behavior persisted into my teenage years, over which there were many incidents that I would never bring up again. She once saw that I was about to eat our last brownie and physically ripped it from my hands - she even pinched me hard enough that it hurt to make me let go of it. She was sheepish about it immediately after, and I could tell that she was embarrassed that she did it, and we've never talked about it since. I don't want her to feel ashamed or like she's a bad parent. The point in talking about it wouldn't be to shame her, it would be to find a way to help her, but her behavior keeps telling me she doesn't even want to change. She's in an endless cycle of deciding to change, talking endlessly about changing, doing it for a short while, and then going back to binging when staying ""on track"" becomes inconvenient.

I want to be very clear that I do not care if my mother is overweight. I'm not the one who wants her to lose weight. She wants to lose weight. I hear about it constantly. She wants to lose weight, while constantly making decisions that work against that because she refuses to address the psychological aspects to why she has an obsession with food and overeats compulsively. I'm constantly feeling frustrated and disappointed, not because I want her to be thin, but because I want her to be happy, and watching her sabotage herself repeatedly, knowing her actions are going to continue to make her miserable, is what makes me angry and resentful.

She regularly binges on anything containing carbs or sugar. It's one of my more trivial complaints, but carbs and sugar do not last more than a day in the house. Whether it's a box of cereal, cookies, a loaf of bread. The moment she sees it, I know it'll either be gone immediately or by the end of the day. (We've tried not keeping it in the house, she just finds it elsewhere.)  Just today she ate an entire bag of sandwich rolls I bought to make sandwiches with. The entire bag (6 rolls total) in a day, because she eats them as snacks. There goes my lunch plan for the week. Same goes for other foods as well. Multiple servings of leftovers meant to last the week? Gone. Again, part of a larger pattern of me preparing food meant to last days, portioning out the food in to-go containers to take to my job, and finding that she ate all or most of it in a single day.

I can't tell her to stop because 1) there's no way to say it without it sounding like I'm food-shaming her and hurting her feelings and 2) she's well aware that she needs to stop, and that in and of itself is not enough to get her to stop. Reminders from me to ""please don't eat the entire loaf of bread"" will not cause any change. It might sound petty to be angry at the inconvenience of running out of food - and I partially agree, it's not the worst consequence of someone's ED and she certainly suffers from it more than I do - but live with someone's disordered eating for 24 years and then tell me that. You eventually run out of patience, not only for the person's lack of consideration for you but also because you're watching them engage in an addiction that's making them miserable. 

What makes it so infuriating is that I can't be honest with her about these feelings. When she binges on food I had plans for, I can't tell her that it made me angry, even if she asks me what's wrong because being honest about it would hurt her feelings badly. She already has so much shame surrounding her binging, and I don't want her to feel like I'm another person judging her for her eating or her weight. So I keep it to myself, which causes the resentment to fester and grow worse, because that's what happens when you don't express your feelings. Sometimes I find that she ate an entire package of whatever food item in the pantry and want to scream, not over the food but because it's the same shit on a different day and I know I'll never be able to be open about it with her.

I'm embarrassed to admit that quickly-disappearing food in my house has made me a little bit food-aggressive, which makes me cringe even typing it. I don't mean to, but I have an impulse to make sure people don't take my food, for reasons I'm sure you can guess. I don't want to behave like that, I don't want to be a person who is paranoid that friends and family are going to steal food from my plate or leftovers from my fridge, but it's the result of living in a house where any food left out in the open disappears within the hour.  I used to hide food from her in my bedroom, which was the only place to keep it safe from her. If you can imagine how pathetic it is for a teenage girl to be stashing chocolate in her dresser just so she can have one treat to herself that her mother won't eat, you can imagine the shame around the conversation addressing my mom's binge eating and why we've never had it.

I realize that a family member's ED is not about me, which is another reason we don't talk about my frustrations regarding it. So I'm leaving them here instead.

Seeing her weight make her miserable from an early age, in hindsight, taught me that being fat is the worst thing that can happen to a person, something I can't consciously un-learn no matter how hard I try. I'm terrified of gaining weight and while I don't consider my diet and exercise habits excessive or unhealthy, my mental and emotional fixation with ""not gaining weight"" is decidedly not normal, to the point that it governs most of my food choices (I don't eat fast food, pizza, burgers, etc. not because I don't like it - I love it - but because the amount of stress I feel after isn't worth it to me) and sometimes takes a priority over other parts of my life (I've canceled plans with friends before to exercise because I'd gained a small amount of weight). I've gotten professional help for it, and am working on it with my therapist.

I was at least 40 pounds overweight in high school (I'm the same height now as I was then, 5""4', and pushing 170 pounds when now, at ten years older, I'm 130). I didn't realize how terrible my eating habits were because the only example I'd had set for me when I was young was my mom's terrible diet and disordered eating. Following her example, I'd thought it was normal to have three helpings at each meal, and to have fast food several times a week. I've tried to let go of the resentment I feel towards her for this, but it's hard to let go of it because being chubby was a huge part of the reason that I was miserable in high school. It gave me insecurities that followed me into adulthood. It was the reason I didn't start dating until college - no boys wanted to date me like the rest of my peers and it made me feel like something was wrong with me. All this happened because she'd deluded herself into thinking fast food four days a week was normal, or maybe she knew it wasn't but couldn't stop herself from doing it anyway. Either way, her bad decisions had consequences for me growing up, and I'm still angry at her about it and don't know how not to be. I feel that she was selfish in letting it affect me, for making terrible diet choices not only for herself but for me (I'm talking about an age before I could drive, and my only options were the food she brought home; once I started driving and was free to choose more of my own food, I lost some of the weight. I lost the rest of it when I went to college and moved out of her house completely).

TLDR; My mom is a binge eater and I've been watching her cyclical behavior for my entire life. She employs the same system of lying to herself, making excuses, playing the victim, etc. that all addicts use to justify their behavior. She's tried keto, intermittent fasting, paleo, pretty much any diet you can think of because she's willing to try anything to lose weight other than eating vegetables and jogging. I think she needs to address the psychological and emotional reasons behind her binging, but won't do it in any meaningful way. I don't want her to be thin, I want her to be happy, and being overweight makes her miserable. She talks about changing, I get onboard, then she quits days later and disappoints me. I don't know what  to change because I cannot do the work for her. I also have a hard time letting go of my anger toward her for the way her ED affected me growing up, namely making me overweight in high school because she fed me the same shit food she was eating, giving me a crippling fear of becoming overweight, and throw in a hint of embarrassing food-guarding habits because no food was ever safe from her in our house.

1316,eating_disorders,"I've had an eating disorder for over 20 years. I've had periods of really solid recovery but that hasnt happened for a while. Last September I finally admitted I needed some more help and started a partial hospitalization program. For 8 mk ths I cycled through the different levels of treatment they offered (inpatient, residential, php, and iop). I was finally discharged in may, I felt strong and healthy and ready to take on the world again. I went back to work after 7 months of medical leave and I really thought I had beat it this time. But then 1 fateful day I decided to weigh myself at target. Since then I've been fighting to keep myself out of relapse. I bought a scale about a month ago and promised myself I wouldnt get obsessed. We all know that didnt last. My therapist (who doesn't specialize in eating disorders) got me to agree to weighing myself once a week and reporting my weight to him. I HATE  telling people my weight but hes trying to get me to not let the number have any power. He has given me the green light to lose weight through ""normal diet and exercise "". Today I met with my nutritionist for the first time in 3 weeks and she is concerned. I agreed to bring in my scale to our appt next week and to tell my therapist that him telling me I can lose weight is harmful and it's only feeding into my disorder. 

In addition I'm about to move into an apartment with a girl I met in treatment. We have become really close and agreed that we would only move in together if we r both in a good place. Well neither of us are in a great place and I am terrified that er r both gonna relapse when we live together. We are already feeding off each others disorders and the last 2x I've gone out to a restaurant with her I was so triggered by the food conversations that I purged immediately after. She literally asked me to teach her how to do it. I obviously said no fucking way but I'm scared that things are gonna go downhill fast. I've lost 4 pounds since friday and its fueling the fire big time. I gained so much weight in recovery and I cant stand my body right now. Part of me wants to keep going and just try to ""control"" how much i relapse and part of me is so damn tired of being obsessed and i just wanna eat what i want when i want.

Long story short, this self awareness feels worse than actually being in a full blown relapse....which is where my nutritionist is convinced I'm heading right now. My mom is cooking dinner and my anxiety over having to eat it is raging but still....I dont feel like I've lost total control.

However, last week I got ghosted by a guy that I’ve been talking to for 5 months. We talked about it and he said he just couldn’t do a relationship right now.

I can’t help but think he dumped me because of my weight gain. I didn’t gain much (5 kilo’s)  but it’s still in my head. When I look in the mirror I see a completely different person from who I used to be.

I have epilepsy and because of that I take a lot of medications, really causing my weight always going up and down.

One medication I was left on is an appetite suppressant, which I didn’t know at the time. I guess that’s when it started. 

I was skinny, but okay. But I liked it. Then I guess if I would feel fat, I just wouldn’t eat until the next day.

1320,eating_disorders,"Hello everyone!Right now I’m recovering from my ED in therapy.I gained some kilo’s because of binge eating but I am at a healthy weight right now, I still have trouble accepting it but it is what it is. I am not actively trying to lose weight anymore.

However, last week I got ghosted by a guy that I’ve been talking to for 5 months. We talked about it and he said he just couldn’t do a relationship right now.

I can’t help but think he dumped me because of my weight gain. I didn’t gain much(5 kilos), but it’s still in my head. 

I wanna get back into the dating game, to get some distraction from my heartbreak + meeting new people would be good for me I think. I have a few guys that are interested in going on a date with me, but it’s all through tinder and I am afraid that they would think I don’t look the same as in my pictures (some of the pictures I was a couple of kilo’s lighter) and they will think I’m ugly or reject me and then I will think it has to do with my weight.

I really wanna go on dates though, but my eating disorder is telling me I should start losing weight again and only THEN I can go on a date.

1323,eating_disorders,"hey guys, I'm new to this forum but I want to talk about my experiences and wonder if I did have an eating disorder. I've had several family members who've actually had eating disorders so I don't know if mine actually qualifies but here it is. from my experience, most people don't talk about Binge Eating Disorder as much when discussing eating disorders. that is why I don't understand the disease as much but I believe that I had it.

during my first semester of college, I guess I was adjusting to the food of the school. However, because there was no limit to the amount of food we could eat, I ended up eating out-of-control amounts of desserts and just food in general. for example, sometimes, I would sit in the dining hall and get four full plates of food at a time. I would have cakes and such for breakfast. sometimes, I would think that I should try to eat healthy, and would eat a healthy item, then eat a whole ton of sugary items right after. compared to me, my friends ate miniscule amounts of food. I did some research and according to Mayo Clinic ""Binge-eating disorder is a serious eating disorder in which you frequently consume unusually large amounts of food and feel unable to stop eating."" I did feel kind of out-of-control when I ate and gave into the temptation of continuously eating even when I wasn't hungry because 1) I liked the flavor 2) I was cold and it felt better when there was a ton of food in me 3) I wasn't very happy.

I didn't really feel guilt for the most part, to be honest, which I thought was a characteristic of an eating disorder. However, I did feel a little ashamed and tended to do this activity alone and would try to eat alone, but the reason I told myself was because I was embarrassed by the manner in which I chewed and put food in my mouth. I would go out of my way to go to free food events, and I would horde a ton of food in my dorm, so much so that my friends would notice and find it a little weird that I would have stashes of food but the food was stored in a sanitary matter, of course. I guess I was a little homesick and lonely, and eating helped. eating just brought so much happiness to my day, and whenever I did work, I would eat. I also can't refuse any time food is offered to me. I gained around ten pounds during that semester. I naturally have pretty thin limbs (most of my ""weight"" would go to my face or midsection) so my weight gain wasn't initially apparent but my face ended up increasing in width/size A LOT those four months. I also love to wear really baggy and oversized outfits so no one, even myself, could really tell that I was rapidly gaining weight.  however, my parents noticed and were pretty concerned when I went home for winter break. I didn't even realize how out-of-control (and emotional?) my eating was and I got a little better second semester, though I lost control during quarantine as well (ate straight out of the jar and finished four jars of almond butter in a month).

does anyone have any experiences with the disorder? I would just like to know more about it and hear all of your thoughts regarding what I went through. no hate please :').",,binge eating disorder,7,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,i2wuyy,1,sadredstar,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/i2wuyy/binge_eating_disorder/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/i2wuyy/binge_eating_disorder/,1596460648,592,0,0,0,-1,1,Binge Eating Disorder,harmful,"Excessive eating of desserts and food, feeling out of control while eating, Eating alone and feeling ashamed, Gained 10 pounds in one semester, Eating brought happiness and helped cope with homesickness and loneliness",Binge Eating Disorder due to adjusting to college food and feeling out-of-control when eating,unknown,"Ate unusually large amounts of food and felt unable to stop eating, Felt a little ashamed and tended to eat alone, Eating brought happiness and helped cope with loneliness","Binge Eating Disorder, loneliness, and homesickness",harmful,"Frequent consumption of unusually large amounts of food and feeling unable to stop eating, Eating brings happiness to the writer and helps with loneliness, Gained around ten pounds in one semester, Eating alone and hoarding food, Increased shame and embarrassment around eating, Parents noticed rapid weight gain and were concerned"
1324,eating_disorders,"Hello everyone. I hope you all are well. I wish that I could be better, but I'm pushing through as much as possible. One of the hard things about recovery is that I don't have a lot of money for food, so I'm hoping to save up some money for protein powder since getting meat is hard too.

The main point of this post is that I am getting very antsy. I stopped working out because I lost a lot of weight during quarantine due to depression and constant berating I have to deal with from my mom. Due to that and the added stress of college, not leaving the house, cabin fever hitting hard, and having to stop dancing and working out has caused me to lose 10 lbs. A number that is much too high for me to lose in 3 months and I'm very underweight now. 

I am trying to refer to this period of me needing to gain weight as my bulking period, as I want to build muscle. I love having muscle and want more of it. Since the bulking phase of building muscle generally does not have cardio, is this something that I can incorporate slowly back into my routine as I try to continue to gain muscle weight/weight? I'm trying my best to eat more, but it is still a challenge. Since I don't burn a lot of calories with these kinds of exercises (generally less than 100), would it be a good idea to do weight exercises for now?

1328,eating_disorders,"My problem with food dates back to the scarcity of it in my childhood. That being said, im an adult with enough money for food now. Yet i am very imbalanced. In always after more, so i have cut myself back a lot.

I also think i have a money problem that ties into the food problem. At the beginning of the year I bought sams club bags of rice and beans, stored them in mylar bags, and gave myself an allowance of $10 a week for food to go with it. Bananas, roma tomatoes, and jalapenos are suuuper cheap so ive lived off of those, and mangos when they were half off. 

I wanted to try this out for a year to see what it was like. I went from spend $80 a week on whatever I wanted to that. 

In order to not let myself fully freak and break, if someone offers me junk food i take it. 

For a while that was ok. I was saving enough of my food money to buy something extra every couple of weeks. Then the pandemic happened. That freaked me out and i went into super savings mode. Now I only spend money on bills. 

When all I have is rice and beans, no fruits or veggies, i freak the fuck out. I tell myself in my logical way that i obviously have food but the addictious feeling permeates from my body. Anxiety. I cave and use my mattress money to buy food so i dont go against my no spending rule. My body gets so weak from psychological torment when i notice that's ""all"" i have. People can live off of that though. Im not dying. 

My neighbor bought me a small pizza today as a thank you for something. I could feels the waves of addictive thoughts. I could feel how very low i would become if i ended up not getting the pizza. It had nothing to do with my hunger. I wasn't hungry. I have food. 

I ate the whole pizza. I feel like if i didnt quit smoking cigs, the food obsession wouldn't be so bad. 

So now the question is, what do I do? I dont want to give in to my addiction to food. I want to be able to live off of what i have and just be ok with that. 

Maybe im looking at this all wrong. Idk how else to look at it though. 

Im not poor. I can get food if i want to. I just want to live like this to try to stop myself from freaking out over it. To show my brain that everything will be ok.

I remember once it caused me to have various amounts of health issues that my mother never took into account. It wasn’t until I got really sick in high school that I changed my diet I went from 115 to about 100 and I decided that possibly going vegetarian would be my route because I hated eating meat it would make me feel bloated.

1335,eating_disorders,"I've been suffering from mixed eating disorder (alternated anorexia and bulimia phases) since I was 13. My usual attitude is to eat too much and feel just a bit guilty about it, until I gain a certain weight and start throwing up and skipping some meals until I completely stop eating. This usually goes on until something big happens that makes it easier to ignore the fact that I'm repugnant and don't deserve eating. Usually, it's the start of a relationship or help from my loved one.
In the period before the quarantine my anorexia phases had become overwhelming. When I then started a new relationship with my bestfriend, whom I'd been in love with for a while but initially rejected because of personal complexes, I slowly started eating again.
We've been together for almost 5 months now, and I did have some mental breakdowns about my weight. The only thing preventing me from starvation is seeing how he suffers about it. It literally makes me want to be better for him. However, I think those short mental breakdowns were just punctures, because now I'm really falling back into anorexia. And the real problem is... this often comes with some kind of side effect, which completely shuts down my sentimental (sentimental only) sphere. So I start living relationships like I'm acting in a movie, without feeling it. Kisses, hugs, caresses, they all become a mechanical habit moved by no affection. If I think of my boyfriend now, he's a friend. My closest and dearest friend, like before we committed, but still just a friend. And even though I know this is probably just a phase, it paralyses me, because we've had this problem since the beginning - I didn't want a relationship with him despite feeling completely addicted to him, until I gave up my shields and let go, accepting his love. However, everytime I feel slightly less in love with him, the fear that I might have made the wrong choice by starting our relationship comes back. 'Cause, maybe I'm not really in love, maybe I just got carried away, maybe it was just a moment, maybe sex, habit and addiction is what keeps me with him, I don't know and I can't know... The only thing I know is I run away everytime I'm scared, and now I'm terrified by both the possibilities that he really is not meant for me as a partner, AND that I will run away in denial despite this (not) feeling being just a phase... I feel so trapped like I got myself into something I cannot handle and he makes me the most happy person in the world, but... sometimes I wonder if I really am in love with him, or if I just want him in my life so much that I accepted being together and lying to myself that I love him, just to hurt him no longer and lose him not. And while I think of all this I started throwing up again, and I don't wanna eat anymore and this situation makes me feel so bad about myself that anorexia gets worse and damn I really feel like I can't make it, I just wanna starve until I die out of this...",,I'm falling into anorexia again and I'm terrified it might ruin my relationship.,2,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hzgwev,1,Lilith_Kea,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hzgwev/im_falling_into_anorexia_again_and_im_terrified/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hzgwev/im_falling_into_anorexia_again_and_im_terrified/,1595950868,544,0,0,0,-1,1,"Mixed eating disorder (alternated anorexia and bulimia phases), starting a new relationship",harmful,"Started eating again due to new relationship, but mental breakdowns about weight have occurred, Anorexia is resurfacing and causing emotional detachment from partner, Fear that the writer may not actually be in love with their partner and is only staying due to addiction or habit",Mixed eating disorder and starting a new relationship,harmful,"New relationship led to some improvement in the writer's eating disorder, but now they are falling back into anorexia, Anorexia is causing the writer to shut down emotionally and question their feelings for their partner, Fear of losing their partner and feeling trapped in the relationship is causing the writer to spiral further into their eating disorder",Mixed eating disorder and starting a new relationship,harmful,"Starting a new relationship helped the writer slowly start eating again, The fear of losing the relationship has caused the writer to fall back into anorexia, Anorexia is causing the writer to have trouble with their sentimental sphere and to question their feelings for their partner"
1336,eating_disorders,"⚠️ Trigger warning: self harm, mention of school shooting, depression and mental health.⚠️


Here’s a little backstory: I (under 18F) have been suffering from mental health issues for a while. Unfortunately I don’t feel safe or respected enough in my family to ask for help/therapy or to get tested for disorders/mental illness I think I might have. At first I was pushing everything bad into the deepest part of me and ignoring how I felt (not a great coping mechanism I know). But a little over a year ago I was in a school shooting. This had broken the wall I kept up to block out all my depression and anxiety. I was suddenly getting an anxiety attack at least once a day and started to fall into a depressive spiral. My coping mechanisms weren’t working and unfortunately I turned to self harm as a form of release. I soon became addicted. But then my neighbor was institutionalized for just thinking about self harm. The anxiety and fear of people finding out and throwing me into a psych ward was too much to handle so I stoped. It took a lot for me to recover but for a while I was better. Then we went into quarantine. My mom just had to start commenting on my weight (witch is about average for my age group but centers around my stomach) and forcing me into exercising. Needless to say my self-esteem and self worth took a drastic dip, my depression and anxiety found something new to latch onto. My weight.

At first I was just skipping some meals, like 2-3 meals a week. Then it turned into 5, then I started skipping breakfast every day. Right now I’m skipping breakfast and lunch (I can’t skip dinner as I eat with family but I eat as little as possible and Im positive that if I could I would). I have lost about 35 pounds in a month. But even though I have lost weight I still look the same, and it makes me feel worse. My mom keeps commenting on my weight and she will poke fun at my stomach and pinch my fat. It makes me so mad sometimes, I have told her to stop and why it makes me so upset when she does that. She just keeps doing it and ignoring my mental health, focusing on my brother who has one panic attack and gets to go to a therapist but I get like 10 a week and I’m just “faking it for attention”.

But now for why I titled this what I did. I like the pain that I get from the hunger. Is this a common thing? I always thought that eating disorders (not saying I have one, not tested and all) were about the weight. Recently my mother stopped her comments, and I still feel awful about my weight. I tried to start eating normal again (starting slow of course as to not overwhelm myself) but I found myself missing the feeling of being hungry. I found myself becoming nauseous at just the thought of eating. I found myself constantly staring into a mirror and standing on a scale hating how I look. But when I’m hungry I feel numb, sometimes even happy. I don’t feel fat. Without the constant pain I feel lost and depressed and my attacks are much worse. So I’m still not eating. I’m getting worried with myself. I feel as though I’m addicted to the pain of hunger just as I was with self harm. And I don’t know if there’s anything that can pull me out this time. I realize what I’m doing is harmful but I can’t stop, and I can’t get help from my family, and I have too much anxiety to ask my friends. I just don’t know what do do anymore.

Honestly I just need to rant and get this off my chest but any help/advice is appreciated.

1340,eating_disorders,"As the title says I sometimes strongly think I was misdiagnosed with an eating disorder. I started therapy with an intern therapist last year for anxiety and other things. After a couple months she told me that I had an eating disorder and should start seeing a dietian. Basically what I told her that made her come to this conclusion: I have always hated my body, hated my body in photos, hated certain features of mine, always been self conscious, been bullied for how I look, etc. I had gained a little weight during that time after moving and wanted to lose about 10-15lbs to be back where I was before, especially since my wedding was approaching at that time. I was counting calories (only eating 1400 a day) working out occasionally. A lot of times I would go over 1400 calories. I was losing weight but verryyyyy slowly. I also follow a vegetarian diet (after seeing the dietian I realized I wasnt getting enough protein which I think was causing me to get sick a lot but now I know). In addition, my mom had an eating disorder at my age (she was anorexic and wouldn't eat for days). When I was around 15 I noticed I had gained some weight and started to skip dinners and I would lose 1lb every day. I got pretty low in weight (under a normal BMI) and my friend's grandma made a comment to me about being too skinny so I felt embarrassed and realized what I was doing was probably bad and stopped and just stayed at a normal weight after that. At the time I was fluctuating in weight around [135-140 lbs](#s) at 5'6"". I felt like I was ""fat"" and a lot of times I did look really fat because I was super bloated from GI issues (that later the dietian helped me fix). So with all these things she told me I didn't have Body Dysmorphia but had an ED. I was kinda shocked to be honest.

So I started seeing the dietian because I did want to get to the bottom of my GI problems but also wanted to hear them out on what I should be eating. She had me eating 3 meals and 3 snacks a day, wayyyy more than I have ever ate before. I told her this was too much food but she told me this is what I needed. I told her I was afraid of gaining weight and she told me I wouldn't. For awhile I wasnt gaining weight until a few months in it all hit me. My thighs began to touch and I couldn't fit into my clothes anymore. This was my worst fear and it sent me into a depression. I am still depressed and still unable to fit into my clothes, I am sooo uncomfortable and I feel like no one is listening to me. I have thought about purging and starving myself, things I never thought about before because I feel so desperate to lose this extra weight. 

Recently I gave some old clothes to a friend who to me looks so incredibly skinny and when she fit into my old clothes perfectly I was literally mind blown. I look back at old pictures of myself and realize I was at my goal weight and feel upset that no one told me I had body dysmorphia until it was too late. I know it would have taken a while to get me to see my body for how it was at that time but I wish someone would have helped me. My new therapist told me I do in fact have body dysmorphia but she has also always been under the impression I have an eating disorder from what my old therapist has told my dietian who has now told me new therapist (they work together). After giving it a lot of thought a huge part of me believes that yes I probably was high risk for developing an eating disorder but I was just dieting at the time (many people count calories and eat less then I was to lose weight but they werent diagnosed with eating disorders) I knew that being underweight was wrong and I wasnt striving to be that I just wanted to be on the lower end of my BMI. So I am just so frustrated with everyone and everything and I have been thinking real hard about dropping my therpist and dietian because they want me to accept my body how it is right now and I told them I will not do that because I am very uncomfortable and I want to lose this extra weight safely but I want to be in my old clothes and feel comfortable again. I end up leaving sessions with them feeling more depressed than before because they make me feel like I'm not allowed to lose weight. Also when I look up eating disorders I dont fit into any of the definitions so if my old therapist was wrong about my body dysmorphia maybe she was wrong about me having an eating disorder?

1341,eating_disorders,"Hello. I am a 22 year old college student who has been suffering from depression and anxiety since middle school and an eating disorder since high school. I have been really down in the dumps lately because my dad has gotten laid off for the second time and I'm trying to finish up my bachelors, only to get news that one of the classes that I needed to graduate in May that I was signed up for the Fall semester has been cancelled. This class is only offered in the Fall so that's a really fun time for me because this is the third time this has happened to me at this same uni. I have been feeling so stressed and overwhelmed lately and I know I shouldn't be worried about being unable to help my parents, but due to covid-19 I live with them again instead of on campus.

To say that I have relapsed sounds like a huge understatement to me at this point. Summer of 2019, I finally reached 100 lbs. It was the first time I reached that weight and I was proud because I did so mostly healthily. I still had a decent amount of stomach fat, but not as much as a few years ago (to put it in better perspective I'm only 4'10). When I came home early from college in March, I weighed around 92 lbs. I maintained it until June and even gained 2 lbs in muscle weight which I was proud of (I really love having muscle). Now, between June and today, I now weigh 83 lbs. I feel like I'm a walking skeleton. I didn't intentionally want to lose weight because I lose weight very easily. I think it's primarily the stress and depression I've been feeling. Due to my family and I still trying to look for work but we can only work online because we're all high risk, it has been hard to find any work at all AND I also have to worry about paying my tuition for my supposed final year.

I guess my main question is how can I get myself to slowly overcome this? I feel like I don't really have somewhere or someone to turn to because my dad doesn't understand it because he hasn't been through it. It just doesn't click for him even though he's done research on his own about it and I can see how much it frustrates him that he doesn't know what to do to help. It frustrates me just as equally because I don't even know what I need to beat this either. A lot of times I don't feel like getting out of bed and I feel like I'm having to force myself to eat because I don't get hungry anymore again. I think it's hitting me even harder because I worked so hard working out and eating more so that I can build muscle and I worked out and ate 3 meals a day for a solid 6 months. I don't gain weight easily, but I know how to put on pounds if I try hard enough. The problem is that I don't have the energy or the willpower to cook and eat. Another part of the problem is that I'm uncomfortable eating with my mom, but since I'm home I have to deal with that pretty much every day now. My mom used to tell me a lot in middle school that I was eating like a man and that I ""shouldn't be pigging out because I'll get fat"" and ""I'm a girl and she didn't raise me like that."" I feel that got ingrained in my brain and once I got badly injured playing sports and that depression set in, that all came flooding back.

How can I get over the uncomfortable feeling of eating around my mom? How can my dad help me get better? What are some steps I can take to get myself to eat more? I really want to get better again, I REALLY do. I don't want to lose anymore weight. I feel so weak, frail and un-energized and I just want to beat this thing. I just feel so lost atm and I know it's something I can't tell my mom either because she would just tell me to suck it up and eat and my younger sister is worried that I'll die after watching a traumatizing video about eating disorders apparently.

Thank you for your help. I'm normally not good at asking for help but, I *really* need help. I can't do this on my own...

1342,eating_disorders,"Hi everyone! This might be a long one. 

I am a 23 year old female. I struggled with bulimia/purging disorder from the ages of 12-18 with occasional anorexia and laxative abuse on top of a drug addiction at the time. I hit my lowest weight when I was 15, and that’s about the time my parents fully started to realize what was going on. I was sent to Utah to live with my mom, I went to therapy, out patient rehab, and started my recovery process. It was during that time that I hit my highest weight, which triggered a massive relapse. When I got clean from my drug addiction at 17, I put on a little bit of weight again. I still struggled with purging/starving/laxative abuse for a while after but it wasn’t nearly as bad as it used to be, obviously it was still a slight problem. I slowly started to get better with the help of friends, family, and a supportive significant other. I stopped purging around 18 for a while, and started to feel more comfortable in my skin. Over the years I’ve fallen back into old habits occasionally.. i.e. purging after a abnormally large meal, drinking laxative tea when I was feeling a little down on myself, intermittent fasting with my friends when they were on their *healthy* weight loss journeys, etc. I’m 23 now, and like I said, still have my lows but I really really am trying to be better. My biggest problem right now is handling comments from my family about weight. My eating disorder was definitely a product of multiple different experiences but i’m sure was influenced by my family’s constant discussions about weight. My grandma on my moms side, her best friend (whom we all call aunt), and my mother, have been addicted to diets, diet pills, shakes, etc. for as long as I can remember. They’re constantly talking about how “fat” they are, and how much they hate their bodies. My real aunt (moms sister) at one point had to have throat reconstruction surgery because of her bulimia. It’s an ongoing problem on that side of my family and it’s incredibly toxic. I’ve tried to learn to block them out, ignore their horrible mindsets, and try to convince them how unhealthy it is to think and talk that way, but I can’t help but also take what they say to heart. Flash forward to a couple weeks ago, I’ve put on a little more weight since COVID-19. I’ve been out of a job, been snacking like crazy, and doing absolutely no exercise. My dad commented on how I’ve “put on a couple of pounds” and that the reason I’ve been having heartburn lately must be due to my weight gain. I tried to brush it off but it still bothered me. Today, my grandparents (on my dads side) came to visit me and my dad, and one of the first comments my grandpa made when he walked in was “Wow, ~dad’s name~ that shirt really isn’t doing you any favors”, “your stomach sure has gotten bigger”, followed by my grandma saying “you’re practically busting out of it”. My father isn’t overweight by ANY means, and it really upset me to hear them speaking to him that way. My grandma proceeded to tell me how she had changed her blouse before leaving their home because “her stomach looked too big”, mind you, she’s smaller than I am. 

I just feel like this constant weight talk and my family’s fucked up (excuse my language) mindset has been so immensely unhealthy for me and who knows how many others in my family. It seems like it’s been generations of abuse from both sides and I just wish they knew the harmful affects it has has/could have on their own family. I guess I’m just asking, if any of y’all have dealt with anything similar, how do you go about ignoring those comments when they’re constantly being said?

1350,eating_disorders,"23 yo/female.
Hi everyone! I have been bullied all my teenage years for being fat. 
Things changed when I was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis (genetic) and diabetes. I always had hypothyroidism as a child.
I lost a lot of weight as I watched my eating habits.
Losing the weight and feeling included within the social context I was in, felt so good. People were finally listening to me after years of being neglected. I became obsessed and soon was excessively underweight. 
Then I had to move abroad alone. I felt devastated with the loneliness. I found a friend in food. I started binge eating. Initially nothing changed. But soon my health started worsening. I still am not overweight, I have started strength training for a year now. Somedays are really good. But other days, I eat like a monster during the night. My blood sugars are a mess. It is so high in the morning. I feel like I am slowly killing myself. 
My housemates are aware of my condition, I have explained it to them. I did so to avoid binging on their food ( I become a different person during midnight ). But they don't take me seriously. I have some nights binged on their food and the shame I wake up with in the morning makes me feel like killing myself. They whisper around me about the situation and I cannot stop crying in the bedroom. I don't want to touch any of their food, but I always end up doing it... I continuosly compensate by buying them food and groceries for free. I wanted to change my accommodation but given my budget, I am not able to find anything suitable. More so I don't know if I will ever be able to explain my situation to anyone...

People are nice to me. I do respect my housemates. But I have started to disrespect myself.. I feel trapped and unable to communicate my issue with them..

Please suggest if you all have any ideas about what should I do?

Please don't be mean in the comments. I won't be able to absorb that right now!

1355,eating_disorders,"Hi. I've just joined reddit because i'm really confused and I was wondering if you could help me. First thing first, i'm sorry if my english is not perfect, but i'm not a native speaker.

I'm scared i might be developing an ed, but i don't know if i'm just impressionable and insecure. 
Well, tbh i AM insecure. I have a low self esteem and i see myself as ugly (constantly thinking that i'll be pretty when i lose weight) therefore i'm often sad. 
I find it really difficult to lose weight. 
My Bmi is considered in the 'normal' range but i see myself as really fat: i always wear baggy clothes, going to the beach is traumatic, and so on. I'm worried that other people might judge me, but my family and some of my friends ( the ones whom i feel kinda ""comfortable"" talking to about certain topics)  tell me that i'm not fat. I'm sure they do that to make me feel better, but this way i feel even worse, i feel like i'm a burden.

Regarding the calories, it's difficult for me to count them because i'm not the one cooking so i don't know how much, e.g. oil there is in my food, but i eat about 600/700 calories per day. 
When i eat, i feel like i'm binging, i feel out of control and guilty, but there are times when i'm really strict and i feel good.
 By the way, whenever i feel like i've binged i ask my mother how much i've eaten and she tells me everytime that i haven't eaten much (she used to tell me when i was eating too much so i can rely on her opinions).

There are also periods when i'm really strict, i lose some weight but then i became obsessed with certain foods and i can't help but eat them.
I don't fast, but i don't know if it is because i can't ( my parents wouldn't allow me to, they would notice if i didn't eat and get really pissed) or if i don't want to.
 Now i'm eating a little less than usual and i've lost some weight.

i dont think i have an eating disorder, but i dont know what else to call this *thing* im going through.

i eat as little as i can because im fat. others say im skinny, they say im losing way to much weight, but i know theyre lying. i have this disgusting belly, thighs that are definitely bigger than normal, gross flabby arms, and an ugly double chin.

 i still eat much more than id like, to stop my family from worrying. where i come from, a meal isnt a meal without rice, so i have to eat at least half a bowl with every dish. but even then, i still get hungry, and i “binge.” i raid the kitchen at 3 in the morning and retreat to my room with chips and cake and sweets. 

i dont feel bad about it until im about fall asleep, at 7 in the morning, and so i grab something sharp and start dragging cuts along my forearm. and thats where i am currently.

1358,eating_disorders,"I might be wrong about this and I know there are exceptions, but having been in the ED recovery community for a long time, I’ve noticed a pattern where people with low weight EDs who recover into a slightly larger but still small/thin/average bodies do better in recovery, struggle less with body image at the very end of recovery once weight restored, and tend to be big advocates that recovery is worth it and it’s okay to trust and let your body do what it wants because it knows best. This trend is based on testimony I’ve heard in group therapy from others with EDs in the outpatient program I’ve been part of since 2016.

It seems like thin privilege does affect recovery, especially for people whose ED is focused primarily on body image/fatphobia/striving to be in a smaller body. It seems that when these people weight restore into a thin or average body, they have proof that letting go of their ED was good, that their worst fears did NOT happen (for example, gaining weight forever and ending up in a fat body), and it seems like the residual body dissatisfaction is more manageable than for someone who weight restores into a larger body, who feels the worst has happened, and who might conclude that trusting their body was a mistake. Again, these are observations I’ve taken away from others in ED recovery as I’ve been in a group based program for years.

But this seems to fly in the face of recovery philosophy and data, which shows that body dissatisfaction and EDs are somewhat weight-irrelevant. It’s just as hard as a higher weight person to recover as a lower weight person - body dysmorphia doesn’t care what size your body is, and thin people don’t struggle less than non-thin people. Rather, people seem more or less uniformly affected.

1362,eating_disorders,"

For the past few days I feel absolutely sick to my stomach from right after I eat until I go to sleep which could b hours. Every time I feel this way, I am lying in bed and thinking about just how easy it would b to purge everything very quickly. 

I purged for the first time last summer and after doing it almost daily for about 3 months I lost over 30 lbs which, since I am quite large, was met w a lot of admiration by my family and peers. As much as I wanted to change my appearance, I felt self conscious about other ppl noticing my change bc they would go out of their way to comment and I didn’t want anyone to catch on to what I was doing. I had a lot of mixed emotions about doing it but mainly I finally felt good about myself. I looked back on pictures of myself from the summer before and was revolted by how swollen I looked and finally felt light and freed from the pain of being super fat. I was still fat but at least I wasn’t the same as before. By the time February rolled around I had lost roughly 40 lbs. 

Anyway fast forward to now; I’ve gained 16 lbs since quarantine started but it feels like more, I feel like I did before I lost any weight at all. My pants don’t fit and I just feel so disgusting whenever I happen to look in the mirror. Ever since I noticed that I had basically blown up Its been eating at me (no pun intended). 

My mom bought a scale that measures ALL OF THE STATS— weight water muscle BMI bmr bone mass visceral fat etc — and ever since I stepped on it I have felt like shit. I literally feel disgusting as if I didn’t already feel that way. Every time I eat anything I feel so disconnected from my body as if I can’t believe that I’m eating a meal and I feel disgusting I feel pounds being added on I feel like a pig and like I should stop eating but I just can’t for whatever reason. And after I’m done I feel so full and disgusting and nauseous that I want to go and purge it all. If I did someone would hear, so I don’t. 

This is the first time I have ever identified these feelings as an urge to purge and I feel very fucked up. I gave in once 2 days ago bc I had smoked a bunch of cigs after eating heavy greasy foods and had to get it out and it felt like “well hello my dear old friend, welcome back to my warm loving arms”. So I’m a little scared bc now im worse than i was before and I will one hundo percent give in to these urges soon and don’t know what to do.

1363,eating_disorders,"I used to have a real bad anorexia and I never really healed so to say, but nowadays I'm 151cm and 55kg (muscular body type). Even tho I'm ""clean"" I still have a dietician that I see about once every two weeks (now during corona it's been a videochat). I had a call with my dietician yesterday and it turns out that during these two weeks I lost about 3kg. Not bad if you ask me, but I did tell my biological mother and she got furious. She went off on me telling me how sickening it is that I'm still trapped in the mindset that I need to lose weight. I told her it's not that, I just haven't felt good. She still thinks it's my subconscious that makes me lose weight. I'm not saying she's wrong, but the fact that she actually yelled at me for that small amount just irritated me. An hour after that, my adoption mother called me and started to question my health status and she now thinks I'm relapsing. I told my SO that I lost some weight and before I could continue, they started to nag me how I should eat more. I'm not talking about like a banana or two more, a whole ass meal more. Then I told them I think it's unfair how my biological mother went off on me and they were actually taking my mother's side, making this a big deal! I don't think it is, but how can I convince them that it isn't? I can't leave them in the dark, I tried in the past but that just sparks up rumors and more yelling...

1364,eating_disorders,"as child and tween i was obese and im sure my parents meant well because since kindergarten i had cried from being fat shamed and begged for help altering my appearance. it begin with my parents monitoring 5 year old me's eating pattern and withholding sweets and junk food (but still keeping it in the house). then in the third grade my low self esteem surrounding my body image became almost unbearable. my mom enrolled me in our local weight watchers program (which in hindsight dieting is EXTREMELY terrible for a 9 year old) and tracking my calorie intake and weekly meetings provided me with the accountability and feeling of control over my body that i deeply craved (i think its important to state that i have OCD so i constantly crave 100% certainty and control). i was the only child there and everyone absolutely adored me and lost weight (but of course since it was a fad diet i always gained it back). then my parents started offering me an incentive to lose weight by taping envelopes with money and goal dates to achieve a specific weight on a special date in our kitchen (spoiler alert this didn't work either). next, they brought me to a nutritionist when i was about 10 where my nutritionist recommended fat dissolving pills to a fucking 10 year old. as you can imagine all of this was traumatizing and more than damaging to my life long body image. ive always been popular but i got fed up with no boys ever having crushes on me and using me to get to my friends, so i decided to begin starving myself when i was about 12. i ate 200-400 calories a day which was always about OMAD and as you can imagine i miraculously dropped 35 lbs in a few months. everyone was floored and wanted to know how i had miraculously dropped that weight and even then i knew i shouldnt go around saying i was starving myself so i lied and said i religiously followed a calorie counting app and the accountability it possessed was the biggest contributor to my weight loss. all the boys i had secretly crushed on for years began writing me love songs, sending me poems, asking my dad to take me to dances a year in advance, and constantly complimenting me providing me with the validation i desired. im not gonna lie it was amazing and fueled my body image issues even more because now i could have just about any guy i wanted and was the most popular girl in my class. the thing was a still hated my body and i couldnt understand why. as soon as i was learning to accept a body that i didnt feel like i deserved i developed severe cystic acne that just got progressively worse over about 8 months where i tried every antibiotic, topical ointment, and skincare routine out there. i spent hours researching ways to mask my hideous skin and began spiraling into a depressive state. i started going to weekly therapy and was in a constantly irritable state and cried about twice daily. before this i was amazing at masking my emotions but then i didnt give a fuck and i just cried whenever and wherever. my relationship with my parents was beyond strained and i contemplated self harm but didnt want the scars. i ate my way through the emotional pain because despite my therapist begging my parents to put me on antidepressants they refused and told me ""i would be hazy and numb"". i was thirteen at the time and i had always been a model student and a teacher's pet but this aggression and hopelessness made me want to be rebellious. i began drinking alcohol to stifle my sadness on a very regular basis, cussing constantly, trying smoking, and i even wound up getting suspended and involved in every bout of drama. i began eating and drinking away my hopelessness and this caused a weight gain. then in march of this year my doctor prescribed accutane and finally my skin is clear four-ish months later, but now i have to cope with the weight gain. im not heavy if u look a chart and deep down i know that, but my self hatred and body dysmorphia have convinced me otherwise. i tried throwing up the food but i have an extremely sensitive gag reflex, so it was too painful and difficult. so i began using twice the recommended dosage of laxatives daily if i binged or having OMAD and drinking zero calorie energy drinks, sugar free gum, pickles, and unsweetened tea to suppress my stomach's growls. i have a thin figure and 34DD breasts so obviously people dont perceive me as someone who typically suffers from body dysmorphia, but i will never feel confident because i will never feel as thin as my 21"" waist prepubescent peers. i find myself constantly seeking validation and pushing away everyone who cares about me. i check my body's appearance by lifting my shirt in every reflective surface in the hopes that a thinner figure will stare back at me. i watch amberlynn reid videos to suppress my appetite and fuel my thinspo. im absolutely spiraling and relapsing right now and even though my close friends and immediate family know about my struggles with food they fail to ever check-in on me or even care. i put on a brave face and fake my happiness and lie to those around me saying im doing better than ever with my confidence and body image because i hate when people pry into my diet. i remember comments people have made a decade ago about my body and use it as fuel for weight loss. i cant even put on a bikini at my own home so on my recent tropical vacation i wore spandex and and an oversized tee in the pool. i am so hungry but i cant risk feeling out of control. nobody ever says the right thing and i desperately need some advice from like minded people. it's 10pm and today ive had a packet of oatmeal, a glass of apple juice, and some unsweetened tea and gum to suppress my stomach growling. i spent hours watching amberlynn reid eat so i can enjoy it vicariously through her. no one is concerned because im told i have a desired figure now and before i was heavy but im definitely mentally fucked up. i cant even

This was alright for a while till I reached a healthy weight but now that I’m at a healthy weight the anorexic thoughts are kicking in. It’s just I’ll eat even a bit more than I should and I’ll be like fuck it and then I’ll eat more and more even though the food tastes like shit only to feel guilty later. I’m at a okay weight but people weighing more than me look much more better and I just look fat. The anorexic thoughts are coming back in and I’m planning of going back to the old days. I try to eat 3 square meals but fail daily. I don’t know what to do or how to control myself.,,I dunno how to cope up with what’s going on,3,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hn1jso,1,quantumshrarry,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hn1jso/i_dunno_how_to_cope_up_with_whats_going_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hn1jso/i_dunno_how_to_cope_up_with_whats_going_on/,1594150986,173,0,0,0,-1,1,"Struggle with anorexia, reaching a healthy weight, experiencing guilt after eating, feeling fat despite being at an okay weight",harmful,"Experiencing anorexic thoughts and desires to go back to old habits, Struggling to control eating and feeling guilty after eating, Difficulty eating three square meals a day","Struggling with anorexia, reaching a healthy weight, experiencing guilt after eating",harmful,"Anorexic thoughts are resurfacing now that the individual is at a healthy weight, Struggling to control their eating and feeling guilty after eating, Feeling like they look fat compared to others","Struggling with anorexia, becoming dangerously underweight, gaining weight to reach a healthy weight",harmful,"Experiencing anorexic thoughts after reaching a healthy weight, Feeling guilty after eating even a bit more than they should, Difficulty controlling their eating behaviors and failing to eat three square meals a day"

This is a long story

So I'm 19 and I've never weighed more than 98 lbs. When I was a kid, my mom told me that she didn't break 100 lbs until sophomore year of college, so I thought I didn't need to weigh 100 lbs *ever*.

Anyway, for non-eating-disorder reasons, I recently posted on one of those face rating subs and it turns out that I look ""sickly,"" ""malnourished,"" and ""like gollum."" I deleted the posts because people were being really mean about it. So I decided to put on some weight. 

I can't put on fat because of the evil little monster voice in my head that regulates what I eat, but I figured I can put on some muscle.

I weighed myself tonight and I'm up to 99.2 lbs... I'm a little spooked, but I'm going to do my best to keep going!! And I'm going to try really hard not to weigh myself for a long time, maybe to prove to myself that I won't notice when I finally weigh more than 100 lbs. Idk.

However the last couple weeks I have really been struggling with all the weight gain and body image. Plus theres just a lot going on in my personal life that feels chaotic and out of my control.

It wasn't originally about anorexia but for me it's what it made me think of so I elaborated. (Technically plagiarism not going to take credit for some of the sentences)

I’ve always loved the beach. Something about it was always just so peaceful. Like i’d spend my whole life there if i could. But I'd never do normal things at the beach like swim or build sand castles, I’d ghost watch. I had a special skill really. Just by looking at them I could always tell how a ghost had died, so many different tales to tell. Some tragic, some romantic, couples and young and old sometimes centuries apart but yet together enjoying the sun and the crashing waves all day long. Some loud and Some just as peaceful as the beach itself. But there was one girl. She was a young girl, usually accompanied by a beautiful dog with shiny black and white fur. It was hard to tell whether the dog was a living stray that lived on the beach or a spirit like herself, but I do know that  they’d spend hours and hours just playing in the sand. Her dress always the same violet colour with a purple ribbon round the waist and a matching one tying back her long brown wavy hair. She was really beautiful, I’d often find myself longing to be her. So carefree and happy. But i couldn’t tell how she had died. The only one. She didn’t seem like she had drowned or eaten by a sea witch. I could never figure it out, her pale face seemed so familiar but yet i could never get close enough to see and she couldn’t see me, as far as i know. She seemed so happy but I was determined to find out how she had died. I would chase her sometimes, trying to get a closer look but even if she couldn’t see me i think she could sense me. Maybe she saw my footprints in the sand or heard my heavy breathing as I chased her. We could run for miles and miles and yet she and her dog never got tired, never faltered. I don’t understand how she could keep running. Her body was tiny and frail and looked as if it could snap at any point. Her beautiful eyes were always tired with dark circles. You could see her cheek bones and her wrists were as small as matchsticks. I chased her and chased her, so caught up in the small girls mystery that I didn’t think about myself fading away. But i convinced myself that if i just kept running for a little longer then i would catch up and i could be as happy as her and skip and dance along the shoreline with her. I would often watch her run all the way into the sunset and longed to go with her, to see what she really looked like. But after months of chasing her when I became as frail and dainty as she was. I realised that the answer had been under my nose the whole time.

I feel like the worlds biggest idiot because all of my issues were totally avoidable. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and have done since I was about 11 (now 24) and my dental hygiene just took a back seat in my priority list. 
Then I developed bulimia without even really knowing that is what was going go and it was pretty serious for maybe 2 years (sloooooowly recovering with a very good support system, still have bad days/weeks). I never went to the dentist after primary school and now I’m left with the damage and it’s just so so SO embarrassing. 

Luckily I have found a dentist who I have a very good relationship with and is super accommodating but due to lockdown I haven’t been able to have the treatment I need and have just been sat staring at my mess of a mouth and wishing all the pain away :(

1383,eating_disorders,"So for some context, I've had a really unhealthy relationship with food on and off for the past sevenish years. I don't want to go into to much detail because I don't want to unintentionally give anyone ideas, but I have a history of starving myself. I'm twenty now and in the past year I've lived in an apartment with some close friends at college. Having the freedom to buy my own groceries, cook for myself, and eat what I want when I want has really helped me develop a healthy relationship with food. I was eating more whole foods, more consistently, and I was feeling really good about it. However, since returning home for the summer and having that freedom taken away - it has been really difficult for me to maintain that healthy relationship.

In high school and middle school my mom recognized that I was eating poorly, but she only acknowledged it by bringing me small things when I was on the verge of passing out or making comments like ""Are you going to eat today?"". Besides that, I had never gotten help or been taken into a doctor for a proper diagnosis. My dad would also get angry at me if I ever cooked for myself (yelling at me if I just used the toaster) because he thought I would make a mess or ""burn the house down"". My own issues with my body paired with the fear of making my dad angry brought me to a point where I would only eat a snack or two in an entire day.

Both of my parents are overweight and have been trying to lose weight together (my dad needs to lose weight in order to have a surgery done and my mom has been ""dieting"" with him). They are no longer buying any bread or snacks and all around the kitchen my mom has posted notes saying things like ""STOP, before you cheat..."", ""Say no to \_\_\_\_"", etc.. Being back home has been really difficult for me and I've found myself reverting back to bad habits - except now it feels worse because there is nothing I can eat as a grab-and-go kind of thing. The notes have been really triggering for me, my parents don't cook for me, and I am still afraid to make food for myself because of what has happened in the past.

With the pandemic too - money has been really tight and I haven't been able to get a job to support myself. Any time I bring up needing something with my parents (body wash, a haircut, etc) it is brushed off and ignored so I'm not getting a lot of my needs met. If I say I'm hungry or craving something - my mom suggests a ""healthier alternative"" which is also triggering to me because I'm trying not to look at everything I eat as being ""good"" or ""bad"". I feel like in losing a lot of my freedom by being home, I'm also losing my progress. I feel very alone and discouraged.

I'm thinking of putting together a grocery list of things I need and asking if they can pick those things up the next time they go grocery shopping. I'm just really nervous about what being home is doing to my relationship with my body and I'm afraid to talk to them about the things that are really triggering to me (the notes, being afraid to cook).

1386,eating_disorders,"Hi

I'm a 22 year old female and in my life I've barely struggled with my weight. Any body image issues I've had have been linked to acne and body hair. As a teen I think I went through a period of time bordering on orthorexia trying to clear my skin (feeling guilty for eating greasy foods, processed foods etc. ceasing to eat things iId loved because i read they were bad for skin) but otherwise I feel like I've had a healthy relationship with food. I love to cook and until a bit over a year ago I had a normal appetite, relatively large for someone my size.

I lost my appetite really badly during a pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage. Afterwards I fell into a depression where I punished myself by denying myself food (being so self-hating that I didn't feel I ""deserved"" to eat). This evolved into a worse depression where I was so catatonic and lacking in energy that the idea of choosing food, preparing food and consuming food was impossible. Even the idea of going to the door to get food I'd ordered seemed hard. I also stopped enjoying food and the taste of it entirely.

Now my depression is a lot better, I'm functioning well again in every aspect except my eating. I still can't bring myself to do it. I feel anxious after I've eaten, a lot of foods repulse me, the portions I eat are extremely small and often liquid (smoothies, protein powder in water, coffee).

I was briefly inpatient for other reasons (detoxing from alcohol), and the psychiatrist I saw there suggested I could have an underlying ED. I've looked at self-assessment quizzes online for eating disorders and they ALL relate to body image. I'm obviously not asking for any diagnoses, but I want to know if anyone on this sub has experienced eating disorders with a different root cause than body image or if this is even possible? Lately the way I feel about food has been genuinely bringing me to tears, eating ""normally"" feels insurmountable. 

I also hope this type of talk isn't triggering for anyone but I've always been naturally underweight according to the BMI. If I've had any body image issues in the past, it's actually been regarding insecurities about being too thin - not feeling like I looked like a ""developed"" woman etc, and having people comment on my weight/ask if I'm eating enough. What's going on with me now regarding eating is stressing me out because of how much more pronounced my thinness feels.",,Eating disorder (seemingly??) unrelated to body image?,9,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hgouzb,1,valeriantincture,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hgouzb/eating_disorder_seemingly_unrelated_to_body_image/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hgouzb/eating_disorder_seemingly_unrelated_to_body_image/,1593241250,428,0,0,0,-1,1,Depression and miscarriage,unknown,"Loss of appetite during pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage, Punishing herself by denying food, Developed anxiety around eating and repulsion towards certain foods, Small and liquid portions of food, Suggested by psychiatrist that there may be an underlying eating disorder",Experiencing depression after a miscarriage and punishing oneself by denying food,harmful,"Loss of appetite and energy, inability to choose, prepare, and consume food, Feeling anxious after eating, being repulsed by some foods, and eating small, liquid portions",Experiencing depression and a loss of appetite following a pregnancy and miscarriage,harmful,"Punishing herself by denying herself food and feeling like she didn't deserve to eat, Developing anxiety around eating and being repulsed by certain foods, Eating extremely small portions, often consisting of liquids"

This led to severe insecurities about my little tummy and my thighs that didn't have a 2 inch gap between them. I started eating healthier about a year ago, you know just typical clean eating like chicken and rice and more veggies. But eventually this started spiraling. I went to college and suddenly I had the ability to take complete control of my diet without any parents asking questions. Slowly I started restricting more food groups, counting calories, and working out a lot more to burn as much as possible. Now, its to the point where I basically only eat vegetables and fruit - maybe like 1000 calories a day - and I'm exercising at very high intensity for 2 hours a day, as well as low intensity exercise for another 1 hour each day.

1389,eating_disorders,"Some background: I've had an ED for almost a decade. Was diagnosed at 12 and now soon to be 22. Mostly, I've had anorexia although had a few periods of bulimia over the years. I've had multiple rounds of treatment of all kinds over the years (hospitalizations, residential, day treatment, outpatient). 

I was discharged from residential about a year and a half ago at my highest weight ever (130 lbs at 5'3). I relapsed 6 months later and lost all the weight I had gained in treatment plus a bit more. I have been relapsed ever since then (coming up a year now). I had made a bit of progress in the month or so before COVID happened and had gained a bit of weight back. Once COVID hit I lost all my outpatient support and could not be weighed weekly anymore. In the last few months during COVID I have regressed quite badly and lost the bit of weight I had gained back. I have been trying so hard the last month to get back on track but my ED is way too strong, I am out of my depth. I know I need to go back to treatment but due to COVID there is zero help available. All of the inpatient and residential centres are shut down. I can't even get a doctor to see me in person to assess my medical stability and I can feel that my body is not doing well. Another factor is that technically I am not ""underweight.""

1395,eating_disorders,"I have struggled with an eating disorder for a couple of years now, yet I do not look like the “traditional” depiction of someone with an eating disorder. And while there is a lot of education out there now and people are starting to realize that eating disorders can affect ANYONE, my family has not learned this yet. 

So with that being said I have recently been working out excessively and purging more than I ever have been before. And almost everyone in my family has commented on “how good I have been looking” and how “my hard work has really started to pay of.”

I have never had anyone romantically interested in me either, so when a coworker of mine revealed feelings for me I felt like it was reward of sorts for my behavior. 

It feels like everyone in my life is proud of me and my weight loss... and as much as I hate to say it I am kind of proud of myself too. Yet I feel the worst I ever have. My head and throat always hurt, my muscles constantly ache, and I feel disgusting in my body despite the weight loss. 

I want to stop it but it doesn’t make sense to stop when everyone around you is congratulating and encouraging you. If only they knew how you were really pulling it off.",,It’s like they are proud of me,9,,,,,,t5_2zzq8,hczgln,1,hit_man_bang,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/hczgln/its_like_they_are_proud_of_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/hczgln/its_like_they_are_proud_of_me/,1592708214,229,0,0,0,-1,1,"Excessive working out and purging, receiving compliments on weight loss",harmful,"Feeling proud of weight loss despite feeling the worst she ever has, Experiencing physical pain and discomfort in her body, Feeling conflicted about wanting to stop but also feeling encouraged by the compliments","Excessive exercise and purging, reinforcement from family and coworker",harmful,"Experiencing physical pain and discomfort despite weight loss, Feeling proud of weight loss but also feeling the worst they ever have, Feeling trapped and unsure of how to stop due to positive reinforcement from others",Experiencing positive reinforcement from family and a coworker for excessive working out and purging,harmful,"Feeling proud of weight loss but worse mentally and physically, Experiencing physical symptoms such as head and throat pain, and muscle ache, Feeling disgusted in their body despite weight loss"
