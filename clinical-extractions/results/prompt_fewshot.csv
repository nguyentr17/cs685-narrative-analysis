&amp;#x200B;

Do I have an ED or am I just an attention seeking drama queen?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for a few months now and started taking medications mid July because therapy alone wasn't helping. (So far the medication doesn't seem to be working)

&amp;#x200B;

Since somewhere around the beginning of June (I think). I started losing my appetite and interest in food. This started getting worse and worse. It went from eating a bit less to eating a lot less to where I am now.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to eat anymore. I have no appetite and absolutely no interest in food or eating. Thinking about food makes me want to cry (I don't know why). When I do eat, it's very little. I also keep track of all the calories I consume and weigh myself everyday. I've lost about 37 pounds since mid June I think, but I was slightly overweight so I'm really happy with this.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this is all my own fault because I keep telling myself I can't eat, that I have to lose weight and that I'm too fat. I feel like I'm an imposter. Maybe I'm just too lazy to cook, to go shopping, to eat? Maybe I'm not depressed and just incredibly lazy. I don't work out or do any kind of sport really. I sit or lie down a lot... Maybe I'm an attention seeker? Even posting this here feels like I'm looking for attention... But I just feel so hopeless.

Hi there, (I had to break my submission into 2 messages to meet the character limit. This is Part 1 of 2 for 1 post) A friend asked me for some advice for her sister who is currently struggling with her relationship to food and her body. I compiled the following information to pass along to her and thought it might be of service to this subreddit. I hope it brings some insight!

Here is a post I shared on social media a few years ago to summarize my journey:

I debated sharing this post for a long time so please read with an open heart and mind. For years, I hated and was very concerned about my body size and shape. I went on restrictive diets, religiously counted calories and steps, compulsively over-exercised, measured everything I ate, always ordered ridiculous substitutions at restaurants, and would often binge while drinking, stressed, or starving in secret. Even at my lowest weight (nutrient deficient, bones visible, hair loss), I still hated my body and thought I could be thinner. From then on, I almost always felt fat. It is possible to have an extremely distorted self image. It took me years to hit “diet rock bottom” where I knew I needed help and have since been on my recovery journey. At first, I was terrified to let myself eat whatever I wanted. I thought I’d never stop eating and could never trust my body to know what it needed. Learning to intuitively eat is a process but it is so well worth the effort! Having stabilized my weight near my natural “set point”, I am no longer constantly starving, obsessing over food/calories/workouts, and I am so much more in tune with what my body truly needs. Diets and health culture teach us to lose touch with our body’s innate wisdom. Disordered eating comes in many forms as eating struggles and body dysmorphia affect most people (Some stats say &gt;70% of us have some form of disordered eating) yet we seldom talk about it. The aim of this post is to share my story in hopes of helping others reexamine their relationships to food and body. I know how painful food struggles and body dissatisfaction can be and am now a huge advocate for self acceptance and rebellion against the weight loss/fitness industry and beauty ideal. We are so much more than our bodies. If any of this resonates with you, I highly suggest looking into the Food Psych Podcast, the book Intuitive Eating by Tribole/Resch, cleansing your Instagram of accounts that make you feel bad about yourself, and starting a journaling practice. \~\~\~\~

Additional reflections on what I've learned over the last 4+ years in Recovery: We live in a society that normalizes disordered eating. I used to think that either you have an eating disorder (i.e full blown anorexia or bulimia) or you are normal. When in reality, disordered eating exists on a spectrum. SO SO SO so many women (and increasingly more men) have disordered relationships to food and their body. We learn it from our mothers, friends, and the culture at large. Many women, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes have become aware of the constructed set of beliefs, norms, and practices that is referred to as “diet culture”. Examples of diet culture are: the idea that certain foods are “bad or good” or “clean or dirty” or the classic “vacation calories don’t count” or “I better be running xx miles tomorrow after this meal”, etc. The guilt and shame that is associated with allowing oneself to eat is one of the major effects of diet culture. Diet culture can be easily seen in fitness and weight loss industries but is also sneakily hidden in the general health and wellness industry. It’s a tricky realm to navigate because obviously we care about our health, but adopting diet culture’s norms and the “diet mentality” is ultimately detrimental to our health, even if it looks like making healthy choices in the short term. (More on this later.)

In order to heal from my own journey of disordered eating, chronic dieting, compulsive over exercising, and loathing my body, I dove deep into understanding the physical and psychological underworkings of my experience. It led to a massive perspective shift and profound learning around our current society, social norms, our biological needs, true self care, holistic health, and more. I have read multiple books on the topic and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcast interviews and stories with dietitians, nutritionists, psychologists, research scientists, social activists, and people in larger bodies who have been through astoundingly painful weight loss attempts and abuse from doctors/practitioners. But most importantly, I’ve lived it. I first handedly experienced the process of going from chronically dieting and hating my body to intuitively choosing foods that feel supportive in each moment, eating for the purpose of satisfaction and self care, and trusting and loving my body more than I could have ever imagined. I can confidently say that today, approximately 4.5 years after deciding I didn’t want to live my life obsessing over food, body concerns, and exercise, my relationship to food and my body is SO different. I never thought it could be so easeful and fulfilling. There is so much to learn but I can try to distill down some core facets that have really served my recovery.

**Intuitive eating:**

* This has been the most important resource for healing my relationship to food. The concept of intuitive eating was coined by 2 dietitians, and is outlined in a seminal book: Intuitive Eating, [https://www.intuitiveeating.org/](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/), the newest addition is now out and I fully recommend the accompanying workbook - Intuitive eating is a direct response to the failure of dieting. Ultimately, you’ll learn in the book that statistically speaking, diets don't work. They may deliver short term weight loss but the majority of people regain the initial weight plus MORE weight. Numerous studies have found that in general, diets result in long term weight GAIN rather than loss. This is because the body is protecting itself from famine. It’s a biological instinct to hold onto nutrients when they are restricted.
* Intuitive eating is how our bodies were designed. It’s based around identifying hunger and fullness cues, feeling into our cravings, desires, satisfaction, and practicing attunement and acceptance. It’s a practice so there will be times when you feel like you made a mistake (i.e. overeat and it will hurt, under eat and get way too hungry and maybe overeat), but that is where the acceptance part comes in. Practice self compassion, move on and try better next time! You're completely unlearning old diet behaviors/rules and learning a whole new way of living and being in your body. It takes time but it gets easier and easier and ultimately you don't even really have to think about it, it becomes so natural. Also, Intuitive Eating is not a tool for weight loss nor is it the ""hunger and fullness diet"" where you only are ""allowed"" to eat when hungry. THERE ARE NO RULES in intuitive eating. It is a personal practice based on developing an intimate relationship with your body.
* Trust is key. It’s really scary to trust your body at first. Especially if you’ve been in the diet mentality for a long time. Trust gets easier the more you practice it. And it’s so worth it.
* Binge/Restrict cycling: This was a major lightbulb for me. I used to restrict foods physically (e.g. restricting # of calories/day or avoiding sugar). Physical restriction triggers a biological craving for what is restricted. It’s within our DNA to avoid famine as was advantageous for so many of our ancestors to survive. Our bodies are created to sustain themselves. A diet is nothing more than a simulated famine. When certain food groups or nutrients in general are restricted, the body responds with intense cravings that ultimately result in binging. Out of control eating that feels scary, wrong, and shameful. My binge sessions were often triggered by stress or being drunk. Following a binge episode, we often then are very ashamed and freaked out about the amount consumed. This often leads to further restriction and the cycle continues. I lived this cycle for years.
* We can also restrict foods mentally. It’s a little trickier to understand but mental restriction is when you are telling yourself you “shouldn't” or “can’t” eat certain foods. The “good vs bad” and “clean vs dirty” food labeling are examples of mental restriction. Even if you are not physically restricting by outwardly being on a diet, mental restriction also can trigger the primal binge response. Our bodies are smarter than our minds. It’s against our biology to be denied nutrients, pleasure, and the social bonding of certain food rituals such as birthday cake or thanksgiving dinner.
* There is also the “last supper mentality” which is when you are planning to go on a diet (such as a no sugar diet or all veggie cleanse) but you have some time before starting. It’s common that your cravings will be out of control as your body tries to get as much of that food group in as it can before being restricted.
* Other Intuitive eating resources: Christy Harrison's Intuitive Eating Fundamentals Course (here), Isabel Foxen Duke's Stop Fighting Food (here), or the Fuck It Diet (here).

 

**Joyful Movement:** 

I used to approach movement as “working out” or “exercise”. Constantly counting my calories, distance, pace, and progress. In healing your relationship to food and body, it’s often recommended to reconsider your movement choices. I stopped running and doing pilates for 3+ years since those types of movement did not feel supportive for my healing. Instead, I explored ways of moving that truly felt good in my body and I approached them with no expectations of caloric exertion, etc. - Yoga, rock climbing, nature walks, and tribal fusion belly dancing are all forms of movement that make me feel embodied, joyful, and mentally refreshed. My body feels celebrated instead of punished. I also approach movement intuitively, and never force myself to do any type or amount of movement that doesn’t feel like it will serve me. I embrace rest, especially on certain days of my monthly cycle, and I feel so much more in tune with my body's needs. - There have been challenging moments where life gets so busy that there is no/little time for joyful movement. These are times when my recovery is challenged and I get to deepen my practice of acceptance, trust, and letting go of expectations. Life is very cyclical and there will always be time to regularly move again. Time for movement is a privilege that so many people do not have. I’m so grateful when time allows for joyful movement but I do not punish myself or feel guilty when I do not have the time.

**Body Image:**  


* Health at Every Size:
   * Health at Every Size (HAES) is a newly emerging concept with substantial scientific evidence to support it. In short, it is the idea that one’s body size does not indicate one’s health. Or rather, that people in larger bodies can be completely healthy even if considered “overweight”. Or that thinner does not necessarily equal healthier. (This is not to say that all people in larger bodies are healthy). You can learn about HAES at the website (here).
* It's virtually impossible to live in western society without some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in healing. Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a ""negative body image thought"" and respond with something like ""I am not my body"" or ""my body does not define me"" or ""my body is my vessel"" or ""the shape of my body does not matter"" or ""all bodies are worthy of love""... I’d recommend finding some little mantras that resonate with you. Try following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes, influencers, etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less fat-phobic.
* We live in a society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear being ""fat"" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products, beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self hatred that they instill within us - It's truly evil. We must remember that ""modern"" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the full feminine form as a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is. Journaling down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!

&amp;#x200B;

**Self care practices:**  


* Healing from having a disordered relationship to food and body is so much more than just addressing the food and body relationship. There is almost always an underlying issue or set of issues that is driving the disordered behaviors. Yes, living in diet culture and fatphobia are main factors, but other factors contribute significantly. Some examples of underlying causes are: trauma (emotional, physical, etc.), unworthiness, low self esteem, perfectionism, needing to have control, escapism, self harm, etc.
* For me, my disordered eating was caused by low self esteem, unworthiness, perfectionism, and the need to have control. When life gets stressful and overwhelming, it’s an instinct to grasp for control of something. Controlling one's food and body is an accessible option. - Prioritizing self care practices that support us is key! Ways to healthily manage stress, overcome trauma, heal unworthiness wounds, and increase self love and self acceptance are CRUCIAL to healing the root causes. Joyful movement is one of these practices but others are: journaling, talk therapy, art therapy, women's circles, reading, dance, yoga, singing, sound healing, reiki, acupuncture, creativity (art, writing, etc). A book that is often recommended is the Artist's Way. One of the practices in the book is a 30 minute journaling session first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness, brain dump on to paper. This was amazingly transformative for me. My writing sessions often consisted of me unpacking my stresses and body concerns, and reassuring myself with positive affirmations.
* So I highly recommend journaling! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore other creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!

I started dating a guy a month ago. Back then, I felt in a more stable position and thought my eating behaviours were controlled (later realized it was just in my mind and I was actually starving myself while exercising to exhaustion). Since dating him, I felt some weird pressure that I'm not good enough and my self-esteem got even worse. He lets his emotions mostly inside and isn't really affectionate yet (rlly introverted). I'm okay with it, but because of that, I'm always second-guessing myself. I started binging and purging a lot and can't seem to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I reached out for help and I'm going to a psychologist in less than 2 months. I opened to him about it through text and texted him if he wants to rethink if dating me was a good idea, I would understand. He wants to stay in a relationship and also said it would be harder for me if we weren't together... after texting him how bad my situation is, he mentioned he wants to get more intimate, but since my ED is so bad, I have no idea what to do. He is so laid-back, that means I need to push this relationship forward because he wants to. Yet, I can't help but avoid calling him out because I gained weight while trying to recover by myself (ended horribly). I'm afraid of losing him too because I destroyed most of my other relationships because of avoidance, I'm really really lonely and alone at this point in life (will be even more without him)💀 Tysm for reading this far I appreciate it a lot ❤️",

My issue is that my GP strongly recommends I tell my parents, because currently they have no clue I've been going through this. I am terrified of telling them, because I feel like they're going to try help me but ultimately make things worse. This is exactly what happened when I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago: their way of helping me was to belittle my issues e.g. ""you only have minor depression \[I didn't\], why are you acting so miserable?"" Or by reminding me of the damage I was causing my loved ones like saying ""you're selfish, cruel and tearing this family apart."" In the past I've confronted them about how what they said to me was really upsetting, but they always reply with how they were never taught what to do when their kid is depressed and ultimately never change how they speak to me. We have an extremely strained relationship, but I think they deserve to know what's happening. I just don't feel safe telling them whilst I'm living at home. My plan was to call them over the phone once I'd moved back to university, but at the same time I feel like the issue deserves a face to face conversation. They will probably find out one way or another, they already comment on how much weight I've lost, and that I never eat with them. At the moment they've just assumed I hate them and don't want to eat at meal times with them, and because I'm scared of telling them the truth I've let them believe that. I'm just terrified they're going to get upset and concerned, and proceed to try to force me to eat by yelling at me etc. which would just cause me unbelievable distress in a time when I'm already emotionally fragile. I feel so guilty about all of this. I just have no clue what to do, any advice would be really appreciated honestly",

I have researched and while there seems to be an ED which may fit what i'm experiencing, my situation is not that extreme as the symptoms described in that ED, at least I don't think so.

&amp;#x200B;

I have what seems to be severe depression and body issues, I am not diagnosed hence it's not clear to me. I hate most food, be it taste or texture, and refuse to eat it no matter what. I can cook very little because I have no experience and am afraid to learn how to cook due to my living situation (unrelated). Since the pandemic I have gained weight, and cannot afford much take-out food if it's not cheap, which usually ends up being fast food. I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate how I look, I always feel fat, and saying I hate myself is an understatement. Yet when I think it's all mostly because I am a ""picky eater"" it makes me feel disgusted. I feel like a child. I feel massive anxiety around food if it's not something simple like rice, plain pasta, or other basic foods like that. I cannot tolerate seafood, nor most greens. Seeing any spices on my food makes me spiral because I won't know what it is and the thought of it changing the taste or texture of the food disgusts me. It makes me feel rude whenever I order out and it makes me feel like I'm wasting food if someone else is cooking for me, and in both cases it feels like im wasting money, and it would be easier for me to shut up and starve. Growing up I was always judged and picked on, punished and shouted at for not eating certain foods.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to think or what to do. I can't tell if i'm just being childish or if it's something more serious. If I think too much about it I begin to cry. I'm sorry for the messy post.",

ED or not. Trigger warning: vomit, eating disorder. So, I’m 20 years of age and for the last 18 months I’ve been dealing with loss of appetite. I’ve been “slim” “skinny” my whole life so food has never been an issue for me. But last year I gained a bit of weight, it went to face and i hated it. I don’t remember exactly how or what happened after but I was back to my old weight again and i was happy. I didn’t think anything of it but now my psychologist is concerned that i may have ED. Im going days without food, living only on a mini sausage roll. Sometimes I wonder how I’m able to go to work. In the past when things were really bad, i experienced major hunger pains, chest pains, shortness of breathe and stomach aches. I didn’t think they correlated. I was starving. I was so hungry but every time I put food in my mouth I would feel sick to my stomach. I love food and I thought it was just stress but it comes and goes, that undesirable feeling to eat. I want to eat but every time I do there’s this voice in my head double checking if I’m enjoying the food, double checking if I’m sure I don’t want to vomit. And then I run to the toilet. It’s the worst. I hate it. I’m underweight and I just want to get better. I’ve lost x kg in three weeks. I don’t purge, I don’t count calories or anything. I don’t like sweets, I hate sugar and won’t have anything overly sweet or with a high sugar intake including natural sweets like banana, but isn’t that normal? I just want to know what you guys think because I’m going crazy trying to rationalise everything. I’ve seen my doctor about it, we ran tests but somehow everything came back fine, my blood levels were abnormal but everything was okay. That was three weeks ago. Now I’ve lost x kg (like I’ve said) and I’m so sad about it. I thought everything was okay. I don’t know how this happened. There are good days where I eat okay and other days I sleep with nothing because of that voice. Im afraid to gain weight, I wouldn’t want to be big. I like how I am. What’s the problem?",

Back in high school, grade 12 I started my ""weightloss"" journey since I felt like I had gotten ""too big"" just for context I was a Volleyball athlete who loved to powerlift/lift(started when I was a kid) loved food was happy had no issues. I dont want to go into to much context since I do feel like it would be triggering, but long story short I developed an ed and struggle for about 4 years before I finally gave into to seek help. 

I was lucky enough to get into an ed program at the hospital where I'm from. I had completed the program and felt my diet mentally, how I viewed food, bp, over exercising etc... was in a way in control. 

Im 22 years old.Past few months I've come to realize that my ed has come back, how I view food and how I perpusly underrate, what are good and bad foods, tracking macros and purging. I just feel ashamed, lost, depressed, stressed, overwhelmed, scared and so much more and just dont want it to get as bad as what it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

My relationship with food has always been normal before,I’ve always been skinny and everyone else in my family is too so I never felt like I needed to worry about food or what I ate since I never gained anything anyways.Around January I started feeling like I wasn’t skinny enough yet and like I could lose a small amount of weight to be at this specific goal weight which I was obsessed with for no real [reason.It](https://reason.It) started small with me just cutting out snacks but over the past couple of months it has spiraled into:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Counting calories/weighing everything I eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-Doing 2-3 workouts a day and feeling fat/like iam gaining weight when I skip a day

&amp;#x200B;

\-intermittent fasting,having specific times for when I can eat

&amp;#x200B;

\-binge episodes

&amp;#x200B;

\-I have tried purging a couple of times but it didn’t work so I use lax tea after I binge/feel like I ate too much

&amp;#x200B;

\-cutting food in small pieces,eating out of small plates while using small utensils to make the food last longer -feeling extra safe when eating a lot of fruit and vegetables

&amp;#x200B;

\-getting angry/upset/scared when someone forces me to eat something I don’t want to eat or didn’t plan on eating/I have to eat at a family event and don’t know what’s in the food,iam hanging out with friends and seeing them get my trigger foods (fear of losing control and binging on said foods)

&amp;#x200B;

\-having a specific calorie limit and feeling terrible and like iam going to gain weight if I get over that limit -being scared of weighing myself -Having meals planned out in my head -when something bad happens I automatically think about starving myself

&amp;#x200B;

I only weighed myself this month because I had to before my wisdom teeth removal surgery and turns out iam underweight now which makes me oddly proud but at the same time I still can’t believe it because I feel like I don’t look that different and because nobody has told me I look skinnier yet (could be because I’ve always been skinny already but it still upsets me)I feel like I maybe have to loose a bit more because for some reason I really want people to tell me that they see a difference or even that I look unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

As for health issues I don’t have many,My hair isn’t falling out and I still have a period but have a random stomach issues sometimes but that’s it.

&amp;#x200B;

So that’s pretty much it,any thoughts?",

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a problem I'm not sure how to handle. My friend has gained a lot of weight during the COVID-19 situation and wants to lose weight because they're overweight now and don't feel happy about the way they look. That's okay of course, but their attitude towards eating, losing weight and their self image lately has been worrying to me. They obsess over their intake and they're very insecure about their body. We both think they're going through a bad period mental health wise and they're projecting it on losing weight. Yesterday, they felt bad about something else and also felt like they had to much to eat, so they purged. This scared me shitless. They say they regret it and don't want to do it again and that they know where their behavior stems from, but I said that's what a lot of people think and say before developing an eating disorder. I recognize a lot of red flags in their behavior and I really want to help them and prevent the development of an eating disorder. What's something I could do to help push them in the right direction?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.",

I have a history of disordered eating - was diagnosed  two years ago with anorexia by one therapist and atypical anorexia by  another therapist. I never followed through with therapy, but was able  to recover on my own (stopped calorie counting, restricting, and over  exercising in February of last year). My cardiologist wanted me to gain  weight since my low body fat percentage was affecting my heart, which  was a big reason why I decided to change what I was doing.

My husband and I became pregnant with our second child in December -  it was a challenging pregnancy with many complications. She was born  several months early and is finally home from the NICU. I am diagnosed  with severe postpartum depression and anxiety, which I’m sure a lot has  to do with the traumatic NICU experience. I started taking Lexapro a  week and a half ago, and am finally having some better periods of time. 

The issue is that I’m still not eating - I don’t get hungry (when my  stress is high I’m not hungry, it’s always been that way). But it’s  almost been a month since having my baby and she’s finally home and  healthy, yet I still can’t eat. The thought of eating when I’m not  hungry gives me anxiety. 

I have been in contact with the social worker and am waiting to hear  back from the psychiatrist, I just don’t know if this is just depression  or the eating disorder showing itself again. 

It’s weird because when I was restricting before I was always hungry,  but I wouldn’t let myself eat. Now I’m just not hungry at all.",

I feel like I did not really suffer or have an  ED though because I was undiagnosed and nobody noticed and I did not  become severely underweight. I feel like I’m making it up.

 I don’t really know what I’m asking in this post. I guess  if my struggles are valid and if I should seek help now or if I am okay.  I really don’t want to tell anybody about this.

I don't know if I'm in the right place but it seemed as good as any

I'm having a little bit of trouble, I wouldn't go ahead and say I am  dealing with an ED right away because in all my Googling I couldn't find  any that seemed to define this... so may be it isn't? But I feel as  though I am on the way to one. I'm sorry for the ramble, I'm confused  and nervous. I haven't put this into words ever before I am in my early 20s, I have hyperthyroid. It's under control now. But I  am still underweight. Not by a lot, but a bit. Enough to be noticed and  enough to constantly hear about how I am so skinny, I am only skin and  bones, etc etc. It's frustrating to keep hearing it, but at the same  time I am terrified for myself because I do not feel strong because I'm  skinny. I don't know if that's a thing actually I am obsessed with gaining weight, to be ""curvier"". Like I am changing  my diet every two days because it ""isn't working"" in helping me put some  on. I feel sick if I haven't eaten, I feel nauseous if I'm eating more  than I can (overeating I guess), but I don't see progress and it is  winding me up all the time. My digestive health has gone for a toss, my  skin is always feeling sensitive/tender and I've never had breakouts on  my face before but I've recently been breaking out a little bit too I don't know what the problem is, I don't know if it's classified as an  ED. But it is making me gradually increasing obsessed with what I'm  eating and counting calories to be in a ""surplus"" and it's driving me  nuts 

I am considering seeing a professional, but the situation in my  country isn't the best yet and I am not comfortable with doing this  virtually Until then, I would like to know how this is categorised, and what steps  have helped anyone in similar circumstances to get better?",

Hello, I am currently about to go into either an IOP or PHP program  to treat my anorexia, but it is virtual because of the pandemic. I was  really looking forward to going out and getting to be in a healthier  space, because I currently live in the home of my childhood abuse (which  is mentally wearing me down, and contributing to my ED) with someone  who is very triggering regarding food. I really, really, needed to get  out of the house and I cannot afford to move. I am incredibly stressed  and also dealing with CPTSD.

I am worried that doing an intensive outpatient program or similar  while still in my home environment will be completely counterintuitive,  and might not help at all.

For the first time in 3 months I tried to eat food that wasn’t super plain or healthy and would make me exceed my daily allowance and I didn’t sleep and I stayed up all night panicking from the shame, im so anxious about the scale going up as I’ve been weighing myself everyday the past 3 months.

I was trying to plan a dinner to make for tonight and looking through recipes, and my meal plan calls for one fat exchange but nearly every recipe would require me to use probably more than a single tablespoon of oil, and I also wanted to make a sauce but that would also require more than one fat exchange. So I am having to choose between roasting my veggies with oil, being able to bake my tofu, or making a sauce for the dish. I could make a sauce and eat raw/steamed veggies and tofu, or cook the tofu and veggies but omit sauce and it would be dry and bland. I feel almost more limited and restricted than when I’m not following a meal plan, because at least I can eat what sounds good to me (but in smaller, controlled portions). Now I have to eat a large volume of bland food and nothing about my relationship to food changes other than the caloric intake. I am still having to view food in numerical terms, and instead of getting to enjoy my food I have to eat meals that are incoherent and still don’t feel like they resemble how normal people eat.

One of the most exciting and motivating prospects of recovery for me was being able to have the freedom to cook without having to calculate every aspect of the meal and just making what sounds good, and this is not allowing me to do that. I get that there needs to be a system in place to ensure that I’m eating substantial enough portions and a balanced diet with a variety of foods but this just doesn’t feel helpful at all and I am still having to spend way too much mental energy thinking about food and feeling guilty that the things I want to eat don’t necessarily match the meal plan all the time. I feel like I’ll just end up eating the same meals every single day to avoid having to think so much about how to come up with different ways each day to fit all my exchanges at the times they’re supposed to be eaten. Has anyone had success with a different model of meal planning with their dietician? I feel so hopeless and trapped, this is the only available dietician in my area who has ED experience and this is honestly making me even less motivated to recover :(",

My sister has always been a heavier person than others, this wouldn't be a problem but lately she has been eating so much fastfood and sweets, an average day would consist of not eating breakfast, heading to work, eating a burger and an iced coffee then heading off to a restaurant to eat more, and she knows that all of this food is hurting her but she doesn't try to change anything and i believe she might be depressed, her room is always a mess and she is always sleeping, on top of that any time she talks to people about her life she always talks down on herself and makes it seem uninteresting, of course this is all me just hypothesising but it seems like she treats food as an escape or a way to get instant satisfaction.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister has tried to go on diets and visited gyms and paid for instructors many times before but Everytime she quits after a week, any time my mother tries to tell her that she is going out to restaurants and eating too much she always goes in her room and doesn't listen to her even though she knows that she is overweight, the part that scares me is thinking of how much she would let herself go after she starts receiving money from her job, right now she is not getting paid because its only job practice for college, but once she starts getting paid she wont be restricted by an allowance so she can spend as much as she wants.

Background: OCD-based eating compulsions manifesting in anorexia, binge eating, binge-starve cycling and general strange habits (only eating at certain times, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I've gone from being a lifelong titless wonder to now having breasts. They're not massive, but they're there. I used to be a ""no cup"" but now I fill an A-cup. Might even get away with a B cup.

&amp;#x200B;

Wont mention weight for obvious reasons, but I haven't been medically underweight since 2015/2016 and am now ""on the slim side of normal"". I've been heavier than this and still flat-chested, so I don't think it's simple weight gain. Late developer, I guess!

&amp;#x200B;

It might sound like a stupid thing for a woman to be upset about and I'm still only a damn A-cup, but this has really shaken my sense of self. I just feel very strange these days and I can't get used to my new shape. Little things like not being able to go out without a bra, clothes looking different on me, ""bouncing"" when I exercise or run upstairs, etc. It's bringing back dark thoughts I used to have as a teenager of wanting to not take up space.

Brief background, I was diagnosed with anorexia for 4 years, then binge-eating disorder for 1 year, and began attempting recovery in 2017 while struggling with flip-flopping to both sides of the spectrum. 7 years total of major depression and other related mental health issues prior to 2017. I am currently 20 years old. 2017: 

1. How to stop binge-eating?? First focused on awareness mid-bingeing that I wanted to stop. I realized I would go mentally numb and binge-eating was a coping mechanism for my stress. I wrote myself a letter the morning after a binge, describing every detail, telling future me why it didn't help, how awful my body felt, and that I could do better for myself. I still read this from time-to-time today. Discovered I felt like I was intrinsically-worthless, but did not yet make a connection that the false belief contributed to my binges. 

2. I always had a journal my entire life and realized I only ever journaled the negative things in my life. I made my first attempts at jotting down positive things as well. 2018: First time I went to therapy. Realized anorexia &amp; binge-eating both had to do with control. I turned to not eating to feel in control when everything else was crazy, and binged when life was too painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized several very important things that made this year a turning point: 

1. I allowed myself to be alone and feel pain alone. I previously used food to avoid facing my emotions. 

2. Food-focus was a coping mechanism. I brain-stormed on paper a list of 50+ other possible coping mechanisms for stress and picked a few that I loved: meditating, drinking sparkling water, reading, going for walks, taking hot showers, reaching out to a friend, working out. 

3. I learned it was important to give names to what I was avoiding: discovered that being sxually abused as a child was what triggered my initial disordered eating. I had refused to face it for years &amp; through professional help, finally began processing what happened to me, instead of avoiding it with food control or binges. I identified my disorder as something inside of me, not actually \~me\~. 

4. Facing a very invasive surgery (unrelated to my ed) I discovered the power of meditation with self-awareness and anxiety. The best way for me was to visualize that I was a tree &amp; my thoughts were the birds around it. I am not my thoughts. I am a being. First discovered the experience of being fully present, with short 5-minute meditations where I just allowed myself to be aware of all my thoughts, sitting cross-legged in a quiet room on the floor with my eyes closed. 

2019: Had a few relapses from challenging life events, but learned a lot. 

1. First learned how to forgive myself even if others were still hurting. 

2. Learned about boundaries in therapy. I either had stringent boundaries or very weak boundaries and almost nothing in-between. 

3. Began learning how to be more open about my issues &amp; chose people to confide in \*VERY critical to the next steps of healing in the next 2 years, although it seemed unrelated. This was the year I began to build my ""support group"". I had no one to confide in previously. 10/10 highly recommend first focus on finding 1 person you can trust with your journey. 

4. Learned about Guilt vs. Shame: my therapist recommended TED Talk ""Listening to Shame"" by Brene Brown on YouTube, it CHANGED my life. I realized I struggled with shame, not guilt, &amp; began to make distinctions between the two &amp; reframe how I felt about myself. 

2020: Huge accomplishment: Achieved my first 6 months at a healthy weight that I felt beautiful at, w/o fluctuating up &amp; down significantly! Really began developing a sense of when it's ok to eat &amp; when to stop. Had 1 more major relapse. 

1. I read the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"": just the 1st 2 chapters was enough to realize how deeply embedded our childhood is in all of us. HIGHLY recommend. Gave me further power over my deep pain &amp; ability to separate desire to eat/avoid eating with desire to not feel pain. Realized I could be in control if I wanted. 

2. Did a 30-day challenge called ""Beating Binge Eating"": learned a TON, highly recommend. For me specifically, learned I had a lot of bad habits with control. I not only controlled food, but tried to control everything else too. I attempted a more holistic approach, identified things (like my family) that I gave too much power to, &amp; began to focus more on me through ""self-care"". -Important Take-aways from this challenge: Even tho my over-eating was not as calorically large as it used to be, it was still compulsive and therefore a binge. I now label any compulsive eating as a binge, because naming it gives me power over it. I would often spend 20 minutes in Walmart picking the perfect calorie/flavor/type of ice cream &amp; realized I did this with a lot of foods, and ordering in restaurants. I gave myself a time limit to decide on food--because, after all, it's just food. Also made 2 new rules on my weekly food-shopping: (1) if I saw a food I liked 2 weeks in a row &amp; still wanted it, then I got it the 3rd time I saw it. (2) every week I bought myself at least 1 treat, no matter what. This allowed me to discover I could in fact have treats &amp; not binge on it, because I knew I would be getting more the next week no matter what, &amp; helped heal some scarcity mindset. 

3. Self-Care: Watched ""AlexandrasGirlyTalk"" Youtube video on How To Self Care. Applied it to my life: scheduled in showers, researched best soaps/makeup/ways to make myself feel good in ways other than food to decrease my stress. For the first time ever, dedicated a couple hours a week to relaxing, even if it felt selfish or like I should be doing other more ""important"" busy-work. Really learned how to connect with myself &amp; truly feel, cry, &amp; not be numb. 

. Attended EMDR therapy for my trauma&amp; began learning how to re-file everything. HIGHLY recommend therapy in general. By FAR the biggest contributor to my healing. I saw 5 total therapists in 2 years ranging from eating disorders, general therapy, and EMDR. It's OK if it takes a couple tries before you find one that you work well with. 

2021: I moved 1300 miles away from my hometown &amp; got a new clarity on what I want in life. 

1. I read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fck"": Realized I cared too much about what my family/everyone thought of me. Fully accepted it’s OK to take a break from communication with toxic people &amp; am currently still on that break to connect with what I want. I had also assumed being a certain weight added value to my life. I was wrong. 

2. I read the reddit post ""How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide For Those Who Struggle"": The phrase ""Bruh, it's just food"" stuck out to me. I’m learning to identify that the only thing a binge/over-eating does is satisfy the urge to binge. I gave it too much control/importance because of how I initially abused it as a child for a false sense of control. I will literally chant ""Bruh, it's just food"" in my head when I feel compulsive, &amp; most times I say it until my heartrate slows down, I believe it, &amp; I can simply move on with my day. Sometimes I fail (aka obsess over food for way longer than I like) &amp; that's OK too. 

3. Discovered I needed to Fail: one day I walked to the gym, stayed for 1 minute, &amp; walked back--shocked when I was in tears with sudden urges to binge &amp; couldn't get it together for a while. My whole life I told myself I can ""fail"" but never believed it &amp; always punished myself after without being aware of it. New way of thinking I am attempting now: If I don't want to do something, I will attempt it for 5 minutes and then stop if I still don't want to. Then actually allow myself to stop after 5 minutes without creating any consequences for myself. Still learning how to do this, but it’s incredibly freeing &amp; allows me to enjoy a large meal and move on with my amazing day. Or take a day off from a heavy lifting routine in the gym &amp; play videogames instead w/o beating myself up for being ""lazy"". 

4. New eating goal: I eat until my hunger signals go away, not eat until I am completely full for hours. Still learning to do this, but it leaves me free to eat enjoyable food when I want &amp; look forward to more later. 

5. Discovered I still struggled with feeling intrinsically worthless. To combat this, I began to put my worth in a higher power, Jesus. Yes this is specific to my religion, but my whole life I tried to get my worth from what I do for other people, &amp; how they perceive me. I realized this will always be lacking &amp; needed to choose something somewhat arbitrary for my mind to latch onto, something that will never change, so even if the people around me are not treating me well, I know I don’t need their validation to be allowed to live a full life. This has helped me ease desires of food coping mechanisms, &amp; instead believe I am not intrinsically dirty just by the fact that I exist &amp; am already loved by someone/something beyond us. 

I'd love to hear what others have used for combatting feelings like this too! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but this is the only thing that has truly impacted my life at its worst. Overall, I realized my eating disorders had almost nothing to do with food. It was the most convenient coping mechanism at the time, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong or dirty about me because I still obsessively think about food sometimes. There is SO much more to life than food. My journey needed a much more holistic approach than just focusing on food... so hope this helps someone else too. If you're at this point or beyond, what have you learned? How do you lose the desire to eat once you are full/move on with your day? Do you obsess sometimes still, or eventually it went away for you completely? Did you ever see a correlation between self-worth/food-focus &amp; what were your discoveries?",

Hi everyone, looking for advice on how to avoid slipping backwards and being triggered by weight loss/gain. I had a fall a couple of months ago, and was severely concussed, i was also prescribed a new medication for epilepsy that can be an appetite suppressant. Whatever the reason, I lost my appetite completely and barely ate. I was not previously overweight, but on the high side of normal for my height, and lost weight to the point where I am now on the low side of normal. When I was in my teens my eating was quite disordered, I would purposefully skip meals and make myself sick, was obsessed with numbers and Convinced I was overweight, would binge eat or purposely eat junk food because I knew exactly how many calories were in things (e.g eating 2 kitkats all day because in my head it was better than eating an actual meal since I knew the numbers). Anyway I consider myself to have recovered quite well from this over the past 10 years, don’t own a scales now and basically until this accident, was fairly unrestricted (I only know my weight because they took it in hospital when I fell, and I went to the doctors today). However, having lost weight, I feel once again obsessed with losing weight. I haven’t felt this feeling for years, it feels like I got a buzz from losing weight and thinking I was going to be eating tiny amounts and losing more and more weight forever. I feel overwhelmed by eating normally again and depressed at the idea of gaining the weight back. People have been commenting that I don’t look good, but I love the feeling of my clothes being too big. I have a normal appetite but have been telling people I don’t and feeling guilty when I do eat normal amounts. I ate a normal breakfast this morning (cornflakes and a fruit salad, defo not binging) and made myself sick after.

I'm 24M from the UK, and I've been a long time sufferer of anxiety. Throughout most of my life, I've been able to control it, but about 5 years ago, it came back in full force and completely devastated me. I went from studying and uni to never leaving my home and, sometimes even my room, and feeling completely anxious all of the time. After a few years, I managed to get it under control to a certain extent. I still wasn't leaving the house much, but I had routine and functioned at a basic level. Last year was probably the best year I've had recently. I started going out more. My life wasn't free from anxiety, but I felt its control waning and I could finally see a future for myself. This all ended a few months ago when seemingly out of nowhere, it came back again. At first is was a panic attack here, a panic attack there, but as the weeks and months progressed, a chipped away at me. I tried to fight it. I tried to maintain my progress that I'd worked so hard to obtain, but it was futile. I withdrew more and more, slowly limiting my life more and more, and now I'm in the worst state I've ever been in.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since my anxiety told hold fully 5 years ago, I've had a difficult relationship with food. My anxiety destroys my appetite and makes me feel incredibly nauseous (it almost feels like someone is sticking their fingers down my throat), but for the most part, I've managed to push through it, but now I can't even do that. I feel so bad almost all day. Constant nausea and anxiety. I feel completely detached from reality. Nothing feels real, so it feels impossible to ground myself in anything. I can't feel present because I don't know where I am. I feel like I'm stuck in a dream/nightmare state and I can't wake up. I know I need to eat and this just makes me more anxious and nauseous. I am really scared that I'm going insane and it's killing/going to kill me. Yesterday, I managed a banana, some peanuts, a small bowl of salad, a slice of bread and a cheese sandwich. Today, I've only managed a banana and a handful of nuts. This is about what I managed the other day when I had a really bad episode of hypoglycaemia, where I almost passed out. It felt like my insides were collapsing and is the worst I've ever felt in my life, and I'm still shaken by it and terrified of it happening again. The less I eat, the worse I feel, and the worse I feel, the less I eat. It feels endless. To make things even worse, we're experiencing a heatwave at the moment and I also have an ulcer on my uvula, which developed about a week ago, so eating has just felt like a herculean feat. It's painful and incredibly distressing, and it occupies my thoughts almost constantly. I've shrugged off labelling my eating problems as an eating disorder, as it's not associated with body image problems etc., but my eating and relationship with food is very disorder, so would it count?

&amp;#x200B;

It's not just food, but washing and brushing my teeth etc. has become a real challenge. My nausea is so bad that I can't physically talk to anyone either, as doing so makes me feel like I'm going to gag. I feel utterly trapped and know I need help, but I don't know what to do. I already take mirtazapine 30mg at night, which sometimes helps my appetite, and I was prescribed 2mg of Diazepam, which I've taken twice recently. It seemed to help a bit, but I'm terrified of the long term problems associated with it. Sorry for this barely coherent essay, but I'm completely lost right now. I'd be so grateful for any advice.",

I find that this has led to me being extremely restrictive and when I do eat, I purge any meal I have nowadays. Given this, I am *still* overweight given my height.

I have tried to recover in the past (before I got to the point of struggling daily with this) by developing eating schedules, eating with others, eating in moderation but ultimately my anxiety about my weight and self-destructive body image returns me to the same spot.

My doctor prescribed me Prozac because this has been hard mentally and caused a lot of trouble with anxiety (I used to cope by being active, but now I can't be active). The medication is helping me a lot, but I also think this medication has caused me to completely lose my appetite. Like I have no hunger but I can feel my stomach rumble. If I don't force myself, I can go all day just eating a cracker or piece of fruit and then something small at dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

This has been going on for a few weeks, and I have lost weight. My physical therapist is concerned because I need to be gaining muscle in my injured leg and starting weights soon, and not losing weight.

&amp;#x200B;

Before breaking my leg, I had really adopted a much more positive outlook on weight and nutrition. I went from being underweight and not strong to gaining weight through healthy eating and focusing on exercise and strength. Now I can't workout like I used to and it's been hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to struggle with disordered eating and would restrict myself a lot. I've gotten better and gained weight since then, but this lack of appetite and weight loss now is confusing and difficult. I feel horrible for saying this, but I sort of feel myself relapsing into old habits. Although I don't have an appetite right now, I am struggling to make myself eat even though I know I need to. I think part of me finally feels in control again by being able to restrict my food intake. I need to not be doing this because I need to recover from this broken leg and I don't want to fall to bad habits again.

My typical eating habits before consisted of me counting calories like a hound, I'd skip meals, supplement meals with drinking water, or eating nutritionally low meals that were low in calories.

I'm obese after loosing a baby at 16 weeks last year and never shifting the baby weight and also after taking a multitude of antidepressants last year to try and feel some semblance of normal, most of them made me gain a ridiculous amount of weight on top of the weight I had already put on and I've lost control of my eating disorder once again.

As a teen I struggled with anorexia and bulimia and I suppose it would be covered under the blanket term 'eating disorder not otherwise specified' or 'EDNOS' for short. I'm 20 now and I've gone the other end with binge eating disorder and general emotional eating. I have never had a healthy relationship with food. I want to loose weight desperately because I'm sick of being large, I have issues with my knees, hips and ankles and always have and being overweight has only worsened that. My biggest issue is that exercising and calorie counting genuinely triggers me just thinking about it. In the past during attempts to loose weight I have fallen back into a pattern of exercising in secret, under eating and all my old tricks I don't care to include here. In fact it was emotional eating for 8 months then suddenly trying to cut out food entirely that made me balloon multiple dress sizes years ago that left me 'plus size' in the first place. I honestly went up about 3 dress sizes in a week and haven't gone down since I stayed consistent for years at that size fluctuating a little within it and now I've gone up a size again. It's made such a huge difference.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just fed up because thinking about how skinny I was makes me want to vomit and it's a bad habit I want to cut from my life. My eating disorders started because of my mum calling me fat and my peers calling me fat purely because my thighs jiggled and I had large breasts. Even at my skinniest I had double D's (UK size if you're curious).

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be able to loose weight without falling into disordered eating and pro-ED behaviours. Even thinking about starting a routine that includes regular exercise I'm planning areas for secret exercise and fasting.

I’ve (16F) been suffering from an ED for about a year and a half now. This is a restrictive eating disorder, which I became aware of perhaps five months into having it. I have conflicting ‘diagnoses’ if they can be called that— my pediatrician thinks I have anorexia and my therapist thinks I have AFRID. I think I have orthorexia. What began as a desire for health devolved into a full-blown eating disorder. I was severely underweight and understood the health consequences but couldn’t bring myself to care. I was content with slowly losing myself.

My parents grew concerned. I was admitted for blood work and heart scans in April, and when the results came back showing deficiencies and abnormal heart activity, I had a private call with my doctor. This was the first time I admitted aloud that I had an eating disorder. I cried and lied but was honest enough to get some truth out. My doctor prescribed me fluoxetine, an antidepressant, based off of a twenty minute phone call. This unnerved me. I was scared of being reliant on medication and decided to hold off on taking it, to see how my mood would change on its own as recovery was forced on me (I was briefly hospitalized and am being closely monitored by my parents and pediatrician as my weight is restored).

Sometimes I feel okay now. My obsessive thoughts have lessened and I’ve been able to be somewhat candid in therapy. I don’t feel overwhelmed with guilt for eating much anymore, though I still restrict in some ways. Food is less of a fixation than it used to be, albeit a fixation still.

But I don’t feel much better. I am a creative person. I adore writing, reading, and drawing and gaming as a side hobby, but lately I’ve had no interest in it. No interest in anything. No hopes or aspirations for the future. No will to live, frankly. I know these are symptoms of depression. I’m wondering if I should give fluoxetine a try.

I'm male 40+ with a lifelong struggle with eating. I've spent years seemingly bulimic and years seemingly anorexic. Mostly, though, the common thread seems to be some sort of OCD self soothing that's happening. My weight has never been healthy but it's now severely out of control and I think it's beyond me to help myself. I've done all the things I can think of and eating is really strikingly something I must do vs want to do. It's been causing sexuality issues for 25+ years, has been caused by or contributed to severe body and gender dysmorphia feelings. Im mentally ok, but I am not and have not been living anything like a sustainable life. I just can't do things I should be a me to do.. need some help.

&amp;#x200B;

So:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not looking for anyone here to help diagnose what's happening....but where do I start? All of the above is self-diagnosing and I would much rather work out with a professional what is actually happening. I live in a very remote, very rural area and my PCP is probably not someone I can go to productively. I need contacts online . What are good resources? What do I look for?

&amp;#x200B;

Second question is: I've been sort of fantasizing about being locked up lately and just detoxed. I feel like just a break from my patterns is needed urgently....in addition to professional long term therapy and support. Has anyone gone to or had success with places like Alsana as an inpatient for a month? How did it work? I'm assuming stuff like Hilton Heads ""wellness"" retreats are unhelpful?

Thanks everyone.",

Nowadays, whenever I have a depressive episode, I just. Don't eat. I feel hungry but even when I do try to eat, I struggle to even keep the food down.

Every now and again I do find myself deliberately starving myself as self-harm/punishment.

I'm quite thin but I don't think that I'm heavier than I actually am. I don't have body dysmorphia in that sense. I also don't starve myself as a means to lose weight.

I would consult a professional about this (and I do plan to!) but it's quite expensive and I'm not financially capable of doing that right now. There also aren't a lot of resources where I live.

I was previously overweight and had frequent binge eating episodes but would do so in private and never spoke to anyone about my emotional eating habits. I started using a calorie tracking app to get to a healthy weight, but I still have the desire to lose more weight because I think I would like how my body looks if I could lose more.

I’m now at a point where all that I think about is food/calories and exercise. I made an appointment with a dietician to talk about how many calories I should be eating a day, my weight, diet, etc. and they said they didn’t feel comfortable sharing a specific caloric number with me because they feel that I am exhibiting symptoms of disordered eating and did not want to exacerbate it. She recommended I speak with a colleague who specializes in eating disorders so I set up an appointment.

I am aware that I am engaging in patterns of disordered eating because I do not trust myself to eat without tracking everything on the app. I’m scared that it may have progressed to a disorder at this point given what the dietician told me today. She recommended I delete the calorie tracker from my phone but I cannot get myself to so that (I have tried in the past but can never go more than a few days before redownloading)

My partner and family are big eaters, and encourage me to eat more even when I don’t want to. I don’t know how/if I should talk to them about this. I feel so uncomfortable eating in social settings because I always end up eating more than I intended; I like eating alone because I feel more in control.

How can I express this to them? Or should I? I don’t know where to start. Thank you in advance.",

I know that guilt isn't a useful emotion in this situation and it's not worth sitting on it.

However, I'm still having a lot of trouble about restricting myself. I feel like I'm not deserving of food as much as others. I see other people eat during recovery and I want to eat too, but I keep telling myself ""oh you can't do that, you're not underweight,"" or ""you're still trying to lose weight, you're not meant to be eating.""

The stress has been piling up endlessly, which has been enhancing my psychosis and delusions as well on top of PMS. It's unbearable, I don't know what to do.",

Hey guys! I'm wondering if I've been exhibiting early signs of an eating disorder and if so, i want to curb it.

The main problem i have is that i am unable to lose weight at the moment. I've been gaining weight a lot recently for a couple of reasons.

1. Pandemic (i mean who hasn't had pandemic problems??)
2. I was cheated on (very bad depression. Was diagnosed with PTSD and find it hard to look in the mirror, much less appreciate my body and myself as a person)
3. I hurt my ankle very very bad and now have to go to physical therapy for it. Which means no exercise.

I am still at a healthy weight. But my jaw line is no longer defined, my tummy pushes out a bit more, etc. I can see that I'm gaining weight, but it's not something I'm freaking out about.

I don't want to wait until I'm so overweight I'm unable to walk out back, but at the same time, I'm struggling to even maintain my current weight because of the problems listed above.

I've always had an unhealthy relationship with food. But it was more of an ""i can eat whatever i want and not gain weight because i have a high metabolism"" and became ""i still eat as much as i want but my metabolism can no longer keep up with me""

Very recently i haven't been hungry. And I'm not saying that I've ignored my hunger, i have a hard time doing that. But i just physically haven't been hungry. I'll usually eat 3 meals and 2 snacks a day (for example) but recently it's been breakfast and a snack.

Today, i was hungry enough to eat 3 meals and 2 snacks. AND a desert. Great, right? But now I'm hungry again and wanting to deny myself food specifically because i felt like I've eaten too much today.

The PTSD issue (i hate calling it PTSD. I didn't go to war. But please don't come for me over it. It was a legitimate diagnosis), the lack of physical ability to work out, and the weird food flip I've done make me worried that I'm starting to develop some kind of eating disorder.

What do you guys think? Did any of you start out this way? What are ways i can curb it before i go down a path i can't come back from?",

I (19f with autism) have had an eating disorder for about half a year- not sure how to label it, but I heavily restrict calories and am at a point where I no longer feel hungry and all food tastes bad to me… I can only manage a few bites of food I used to love because the taste is so sour in my mouth. I have also been finding whenever I eat I get bad stomach aches- not sure if that’s anxiety or if my body can’t handle food anymore.

My parents (who i still life with) are obsessive about food and have told me my whole life that I was too fat and need to eat less (I have never been overweight in my life, they just have an obsession with me being bone thin). Lately since I have lost a lot of weight they have been telling me I look good and are proud of me for losing weight. I have lightly tried to tell them that I have an eating disorder and it doesn’t help when they encourage it but I am always met with “we are just trying to make sure you’re healthy” and end up yelling at me and sometimes crying.

I am not in a position to get a job, so I cannot afford therapy, plus I don’t know how I’d get there since I don’t have a car and my parents can’t know I’m going to therapy. I am scared I am going to cause irreversible damage on my body and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Does anyone know of free online Ed recovery or other tricks that helped them? I am desperate.

About 7 months ago, due to my doctors instructions, I had to overhaul my diet due to some health issues. Before I went on this diet I was in a healthy weight, leaning a bit towards heavier than my usual weight since I had stopped working out during the pandemic. My health issues have been a significant part of my life for the past 7 years, and the possibility of not having to deal with them as much is honestly both scary and something I’m really looking forward to.

I have made good progress so far, and my health issues have reduced considerably. However, I fear I may have gone too overboard with the health regiment. I am now edging closer and closer to underweight than I have ever in my life, and I find it difficult to let myself eat bigger portions or add things to my diet that I shouldn’t have often (even if I’m allowed to every now and then). I haven’t really given myself any “treats” or off days in months, and I am starting to get anxious when I gain weight or feel like I’m deviating from my diet instructions.

I’ve always had a very healthy relationship with food, and I feel like I’ve lost that a bit. Some days I don’t even really feel hungry and struggle to eat because I don’t really have as much joy when eating, it all just seems like a “necessary for survival” thing rather than anything else. Some days I don’t have that much energy to do things either, though I am trying to eat balanced and in big enough portions.

Has anyone gone through something like this and could tell me how they managed? I just think I’m having a hard time finding the middle ground. I don’t want to end up being too weight conscious (which I already am, if I’m being honest) or damaging my health this way when I’m supposed to be doing this to get better. Is there anything I should be looking into or doing?

Thank you.",

Hello,

I need some help. I have no official diagnosis yet but fall into BED (imo) and I am overweight. My Dr wants me to eat a particular diet which I have been trying to stick to since January but I fail. The longest I can stick to it is 12 days before I start to binge. How do I stop?

Also I am curious if it sounds like I have a disorder at all. I understand I would need to see a specialist someday for a diagnosis but would appreciate to hear if anyone else is like me. For me I can be not hungry for a long time and won't seem to struggle and then I get a sudden craving for a particular food and I almost eat nothing but that food for days on end until I get so sick of it and don't eat it for sometimes years. Sometimes foods I've never really eaten before or sometimes it is childhood comfort food. I've been like this for a very long time. I'll just eat it 4 or 5 times a day where as other days I can go most of the day not excessively peckish. I've been eating cheese and spring onion sandwiches for days on end and can't stop wanting them.

I am so upset with myself because I'm due to go back to my dr in a few days and no I've ruined the progress I made last month. I have felt so robotic eating the last few days :(",

Looking for advice from anyone who has struggled with this. I grew up an athlete since 7 years old and competed through college, I did some marathons after college and eventually ended up with an autoimmune disease that forced me to the sidelines on occasion. I've struggled with over exercising and restricting/binging for many years. I had a good 5 years maybe that I actually stopped binge eating, even though I was exercising fairly heavily, I think because I was super strict with my diet as far as what I could eat basically meat, veggies and some fruit, I did this for my autoimmune disease but it really helped as far as not binging. I'm not a ""moderator"" as in, I find it pretty much impossible to eat just a little bit of certain things, they end up making me want more once I have them and I obsess over them (sugar in particular), so when I eliminated all of those triggers I didn't feel the urge to binge. I did eat a TON, but I finally felt good about my body composition and didn't feel crazy around food despite being fairly limited in what I was eating. It took my binge/restrict mindset away. I realize many people may disagree with this and think we all need to eat our trigger foods so we're not triggered by them anymore, but I've tried way too many times to do this and for me personally this doesn't work.

Enter Covid and a constant flare in my autoimmune disease, and staying at home I somehow thought I would just ""try other foods again"" to see if they made a difference in my disease. And now over a year later of back and forth binging/restricting/fasting over exercising, and I'm pretty much miserable right now.

I find that when I overdo it with my exercise, I get extremely hungry and stressed. It messes with my sleep, I wake up in the middle of the night and then can't get back to sleep which then makes me crave binge foods more. However I feel somewhat addicted to working out, I think part of it is the endorphins it gives me, and I also don't know what to do with myself when I don't work out. I have other interests, but I feel as if something is missing when I don't exercise. I believe that if I could take some time off, it would be easier to get a hold of my eating and get back on track. I just am having a really difficult time convincing myself to do it. I tell myself again and again that I need to take some time off or that I won't push myself so hard when I go to the gym, and then I completely over do it and it sets me up to want to binge.

I know I can stop binging since I've done it before and legitimately thought I was done with it, but I did a year and half of tracking calories and lost quite a bit of weight, which I didn't really need to, and now I recently lost weight due to some antibiotics I had to take but am having rebound eating from that. Every time I lose a good amount of weight my body goes into overdrive to make up for it eventually.

To people who have never dealt with binge eating, I know this will seem stupid, but it's a legitimate struggle. I want to be able to work out hard without having extreme hunger and stress which leads me to want to binge, but I think I need to find a way to moderate my exercise. Does anyone have any tips or dealt with as similar situation? I'm revisiting Brain Over Binge and Never Binge Again, and I know I just need to stop reinforcing the binging, but I feel like my over exercise is a large component to this.

I should say I'm trying to get back to the way of eating I was on when I was binge free but it has been insanely difficult I think because I'm still currently working from home and my structure is not there like it used to be.

I've been to therapy and it never seems to help.",

Okay so im making this post on behalf of my beautiful amazing girlfriend because honestly im at a loss. I strongly suspect she has an ED but she wont get tested because you can be professionally discriminated against (lower salary) if you have things like that on your medical record here (were hoping to move away one day but thats not in the cards until after she finishes uni and we both have some monry behind us), so we dont know what it is or if she has one but i really suspect she does as she has alot of symptoms in common with my best friend and cousin who both have/had eating disorders / body dysmorphia.

So, her symptoms (idk if thats the right word sorry) as far as ive seen so far is that she gets nauseous almost every time she eats; she has to force herself to finish the last bite as in her words she feels as though doing that is what will make her nauseous (which is part of why i believe the nausea is caused psychologically rather than physically but idk); she really cant eat alot normally unless shes having a good food day / is in a good mood; and alot of the times when she finds a food she likes, shell have it a couple of times then says its bland / makes her nauseous.

I really dont know what to do as were long distance right now because of covid and shes staying with her mother whonis very negative about food in general, criticises her for not eating enough but then when she eats foods that her (vegetarian, pseudo health science (literally believes you can live off of sunlight and water)) mother doesnt approve of shes negative then too, so my girlfriends entire attitude around food is very poor and she has zero support at home.

Does anyone know what might be causing this? And/or how to combat some of these symptoms or get around them? Im sorry for rambling but im worried and idk what else to do.",

Post: Almost 2 years ago I finally opened up about my anxiety and depression and got medicated/therapy. I never discussed with my therapist about this because I thought it was somewhat normal, but for around this time my depression was exceptionally high which caused my eating habits to be amplified. By this I mean that somedays I would be in bed until 3-6pm not having eaten anything, and not be motivated to do anything. As soon as I got up out of bed, I would start my binge eating. Usually I would eat one whole pizza, a big soda and just lots of junk food, and even then I would still eat more and more. some days I would just *choose* not to eat anything for no specific reason, and once I felt like it, I would start the binge eating again. Somedays I would have a regular eating schedule, but that was pretty rare. From what I remember, I would usually not eat anything, or eat so much I didn't realize how much I had just eaten.",

Honestly, I don't know if this counts. I'm sorry for wasting your time if it doesn't. Since around 12 or so years old, or 3-5 years ago (I have difficulty with time due to trauma), my mother has been digging into my self esteem. She'd grab my stomach to show how 'fat' I was, even though I was a healthy weight. She's shame me about my body, tell me my stretch marks were gross. I gained a chest and a butt, unfortunately. My mother used this as proof I was overweight. She's used the things I love and my insecurities to pressure me to lose weight. When I told her I had dysphoria and didn't like my chest she told me to lose weight. When I went to a wresting competition she tried to get me to lose weight so I could be in a lower weight class. When I joked about how weird knees are, she told me to lose weight so I ""wouldn't have that extra skin"". I was encouraged to lose weight in unhealthy ways. I lost too much weight too fast and all she said is ""it doesn't show."" I was told to eat less that xxxx calories a day (very low)), which lead to me crying. I've vomited to get food out of me once, and I'm scared I'll do it again. I can't go to my mother because she wouldn't believe me because I'm not thin. I even had lipoedema, a disease characterized by fat in the legs that is metabolically independent. I was muscular! Every time I try to recover or build up my self esteem she tears it down again. I've considered suicide because of this. I wouldn't tell her that because it feels too manipulative. I just don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I don't know what I can do.",

Hi everyone,

I (25F) just want a safe space to talk. I feel a little lost. I hope this doesn't cause any triggers.

I've only started to accept the fact I don't have a healthy relationship to food the past maybe, year? *I fell into the false belief all these years that I wasn't a specific weight to be able to have a eating disorder*

I would binge eat a lot when I was 14 due to stress and living in a abusive household, I was the heaviest I had ever been. Then I started purging a lot when I was 16/17 because I wanted to lose weight after a break up, after awhile I got worried about my dental hygiene so I stopped. I thought this was a phase I was going through. I was wrong. I have been on a journey of self-love and healing for a few years now, but I've been on and off with smoking cigarettes (I also stopped abusing drugs and self-harming years ago) but my binge eating has slowly made its way back when I'm stressed/anxious/depressed, I'll eat too much too the point I'll throw up and then I will feel gulity and starve myself so I don't gain too much weight. I do try to eat healthy for a few days, but then I just get stressed and binge eat. The process starts again. Then I start smoking again (binge smoke for a few days) to stop my appetite. It's this constant battle. I do put on and lose weight very frequently, but not enough for it to ""look"" like I have a ED.

I got into a relationship a year ago and I've noticed I have been getting triggered a lot easier. My partner hates smoking and I agree because I dont want to be a smoker - but it's been hard to not smoke when I get triggered. My partner had a ex who had a ED and other mental health problems and I know this relationship affected him badly (emotionally abusive), so I don't want to tell him I have a ED. I've told him that the reason I smoke is because I eat junk food when I'm stressed out so I replace it with smoking instead sometimes. He's trying to be supportive of me quitting smoking but I haven't fully opened up to him about this side of me yet - and honestly I'm terrified to.

My triggers though...

I get triggered badly when I notice him looking at an attractive girl (he's not gawking, just a quick glare), when he likes photos of attractive girls, friends he has slept with or if I see him having a friendly conversation with a attractive girl while we're out. This stems from my own insecurities (I was sexually assaulted in my childhood and been cheated on in my last relationship). I don't want to control him. But these things really throw me off - I either binge eat or I lose my appetite completely. I get quiet, sometimes cry and skip dinner. It's hard to do this all away from him because we are currently travelling in a van. He gets worried about me and he tries to be there as best as he can, but I don't let him because I'm honestly still trying to process this and I have to deal with this on my own (No way I'm going to tell him my triggers, that will break his heart).

I've only opened up to my best friend about this recently and she's shocked because she knew I did purge in high school but thought I haven't had any issues since.

Thanks for listening I'm just unsure what to do because I can't afford online therapy right now",

So the situation is pretty bad atm. The last time I saw them was last year and then it was bad. Our other friend saw him recently and said he was worse. I don't want to assume a diagnosis but they're extremely underweight. Veins are bones are prominent. They're quiet and they're family hasnt seemed to have intervened that much (I contacted a family member to ask about they're progress. ) me and my two other friends have tried to be gentle and ask in different ways ""what's going on?"", “how you managing? We all care about you and are a lil worried."" We are trying our best not to make comments on they're appearance and to just be there to make him feel supported in general. However this isn't enough anymore. Me and my other friends are currently in discussions about what we can do but we have never been in this situation before and we don't want to overstep a boundary and ruin our relationship with him and his family. Also to add he is trans so he is dealing with body issues on a whole other level.

Does anyone have any advice? (UK based)

It's happened 4 times so far, after a couple weeks of barely eating I'm back to normal, my apatite returns and I eat a much healthier amount.

&amp;#x200B;

I only noticed this after a few people commented on me losing weight when my school returned to in-person learning and I starting paying a bit more attention to my eating habits to try to figure out why.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last year I've went from borderline obesity to about halfway between ""overweight"" and ""healthy"" according to BMI, I'd love to give actual numbers to better explain the situation but the subs rules don't allow that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is getting overly long, but I just wanted to make sure there was enough info here to properly explain the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

As a closing note I'll address the reason for posting this. I've spent the last few days at a friend's house and he noticed how little I eat, he originally just brushed it off as me not being hungry, but after 3 days of seeing me eat maybe X calories/day (extremely low) he had a little talk with me to make sure I was okay, I told him pretty much the same thing I've said here. In the end I forced myself to eat a burger so he'd be happy and now I'm here posting this.

In these weeks I’ve noticed how she constantly talks about how much she exercises, that she weighs all her food, that she cannot even think about gaining weight, that she has absolute control over the calories she eats, and of course it comes with comments like “I could never respect someone who chooses to be fat”.

&amp;#x200B;

I have to force myself to eat during the day, it feels like I could go days without eating and not be effected. It's rare I have hunger cues and have an appetite, it's often so low that the thought of eating makes me uncomfortable. If I do get hunger cues I often ignore them. I usually go without or force myself. I can't eat in public or around people in general because I either get regular anxiety that makes me feel sick or I avoid it because I'm worried about that happening.

&amp;#x200B;

Until night time rolls around... and I eat myself to sleep. This is where I get most of my ""nutrients"" - it's in quotes because it rarely stuff that's considered healthy. Sometimes I'll even wake up and eat to get myself back to sleep, even when I probably don't need to

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not obsessed with my weight and it's in a healthy range, but I do notice myself having body dysmorophia. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I should stop binging at night because otherwise I wouldn't be getting near enough calories. It feels out of control (during the day I don't have control over not eating enough and at night with binging). I've been prescribed those ensure drinks and I often rely on those during the day. I've tried scheduling meal times, planning my meals, and more. With no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like my last option is to start counting calories using an app. It seems like it could keep me on track, it helps for me to have very specific goals because while I have ocpd and perfectionist tendencies that I often use to my advantage to reach goals, I also have adhd that makes it near impossible to track things if they're not clear, specific, and easy. For reference, most of my negative ocpd/perfectionist tendencies have to do with relationships, my dr says it's good I often use them to my advantage while also trying to correct the negative aspects

I wasn’t cutting any food group, and ate dessert whenever I wanted, it felt like I was on the right track.

&amp;#x200B;

During my journey, I read and watched multiple videos on healthy weight loss and I was doing CICO while learning about healthy life. I never restricted too much, but I had some anxiety surrounding my caloric intake. I felt like I had to eat less than my calorie goal and it didn’t feel quite right. A few months after I started my journey we had a lot of issues at home, my sister got pregnant and my parents are extremely conservative. This took away my safe space and I stopped doing exercise and had to put up with my narcissistic parents and deal with their yelling and shaming. I was under a lot of pressure due to university work as I was doing my last trimester.

&amp;#x200B;

Christmas came around and I stopped tracking calories but didn’t eat extreme amounts of food, however, my mother would tell me that I had gained weight and my grandparents would constantly try to give me junk food, and I started to lose control over my diet. I would eat a lot and them try to get back on track and would fail miserably, I would always tell myself that I would try again on Monday…and fail yet again.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m in charge of making the food at home, and I simply cannot stop snacking and trying the food right before I was done cooking. My parents constantly buy junk food, en even though I like it, it triggers binge eating because I feel hungry afterwards. Right then, it was when things at home got extremely bad and I spiraled down into a depressive episode and I lost control. I eat whenever I’m nervous or anxious, and my anxiety has been on edge these past months. I know I need therapy and/or a psychiatrist, but I have no funds and my parents won’t do it, they just don’t believe in it. Recently I’ve tried to go back to tracking and I started exercising but I constantly fail, I cannot even look back at the MyFitnessPal app because it shows how much I had lost and I have gained most of it back. I really enjoy exercising and even joined a group where we all help each other out, but I’ve lost motivation recently.

When I was going into 7th grade, the month before school started, I just…didn’t eat. It wasn’t a conscious effort, I just didn’t feel like going to the kitchen to make anything.

I lost a lot of weight this way, and as I was overweight before, my mom noticed. She mentioned it and asked if I had anorexia but I said no, but what I noticed was that every time she mentioned me not eating, it made me want to go longer without food. I weighed myself a lot in this time.

Throughout the school year, my friends and one of my teachers commented, “you’re a twig” (and things of that nature) and “did you lose weight over the summer?”, respectively. For seventh and eighth grade, whenever I noticed my stomach was sticking out more than I liked, I would just think to myself “okay, just don’t eat until it’s flat”. I still ate a lot of snacks and food but I wasn’t physically able to eat as much as before.

My parents always comment on how thin I am, even though now I eat more (although very occasionally I feel regret when I eat a lot of snacks at once. I think of throwing up but I never go through with it), and I know I don’t have a healthy eating pattern, because I tend to go a long while without eating much and then I just eat a lot at once and the cycle repeats. I don’t consciously do it, but it happens.

My mom noticed I started gaining weight and mentions my stomach, arms, and face/chin a lot. I get kinda nervous when they take my weight at the doctors office because she asks them about my weight and how much I weighed at the last visit and I can’t tell what she’s thinking, as she has a poker face but also looks like she’s thinking. Before that summer before seventh grade, she also constantly talked about how I needed to lose weight and when I was a lot younger, she put me on a diet.

I don’t feel like this is an eating disorder, but is it?

TL;DR There was a period of time where I didn’t eat and wanted to stop eating even more when people commented about it or I noticed my stomach sticking out. I don’t mind how if I look bigger but I don’t like hearing that I gained weight or my mom hearing my weight at the doctors office. I don’t have a very healthy eating pattern currently, eating a lot one day and the next few days not eating. It’s not on purpose. My mom talks about my weight and my looks a lot.",

&amp;#x200B;

Struggled with eating disorders my whole life, starting at about 12 or so. Really toxic family-you're familiar I'm sure. I don't want to get into the specifics of how unhealthy my relationship with food and exercise was- but I was big into pro-ana tumblr if that gives you some kind of measure of where my head was at. Somewhere in 2015/16 I started working on it and became more comfortable with food, and slowly over time I just.. abandoned all diet and exercise. I felt like I couldn't handle looking at any kind of nutrition or workout routine in a healthy way so I just tuned it all out. Not so shockingly, I ended up putting on a lot of weight. But to be honest, I didn't mind. I liked not having the stress of diet or exercise preying on my every move and destroying my mental health. I didn't love my body but I was accepting of her new look and figured it was a fair trade for not having to think about food/workingout/looking perfect all the time. That's the background story, more or less.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Completely ignoring and avoiding something is not the same as healing from it and I came to recognize that. Since 2020 I've been slowly working on making healthier choices and being a little more active. And I liked it! This year I've started doing lots of activities that I've missed and feeling really good doing them. The last time I was active, it was a means to an end- I enjoyed the results and the process was sacrifice to achieve it. I forgot how great it is to run just for the pleasure of running. Physical activity feels amazing and brings me so much happiness! And I've been healing my relationship with food, making healthy choices for health's sake while still enjoying some less-than-healthy favorites. Honestly? I'm really happy with where I'm at and how I got here. It took years and I'm only excited to see where this goes. I would love to become more physically capable so I can enjoy more achievements within my new hobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky:

&amp;#x200B;

Ana sits on my shoulder like a devil and whispers into my ear. I've noticed my own weight loss and I try not to give it too much space in my life. A part of me will always have that ED and I have to deal with that everytime I look in the mirror. That's a struggle on it's own, but one I've been managing.Everyone else, however, keeps commenting on my weight loss and its devastating. I'm aware that I've lost weight but I have been so so careful to make sure it's not a focal point for me. I don't count any calories or look at portions and I don't weigh or measure myself. I measure my progress in what I'm physically capable of. A few months ago I could barely run 3km. Last week, I ran 13km! I've put in a lot of work and I'm finally seeing progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I said that to a friend recently: that I had run 13km and I was happy to be seeing progress and he said, ""I'll say you can see progress! That shirt's hanging off you like a tent!"" A few people joined in behind him, remarking on my weight loss, singing my praises. My heart shattered. Weight loss hadn't even occurred to me as something worth being proud of. It was just a side-effect of my hard work. There I was beaming about my accomplishment and it was inconsequential compared to how i looked.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only do I have to work extra hard to make sure I keep my mind focused on what's important so I don't slip into a bad place- But that now that task feels impossible since it seems that everyone only cares about weight. It feels like I could run a marathon and they'd tell me how amazing I Look.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm disheartened. I haven't even lost that much weight (posting numbers is against the rules, but believe me, it hasn't been much and it's been over the course of months) and EVERYONE comments on it. I don't have a single person in my life who hasn't brought it up. It makes me sick and honestly? It makes me want to quit doing anything just so people stop talking about my body and my weight.

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm terrified the more I get praised and complimented for my weight loss- the louder Ana gets. The validation of people liking me and liking my appearance more is equal parts saddening and tempting. I haven't slipped up yet: I'm still eating well and I'm not over exerting myself but I am thinking about my weight and my body more. I'm finding myself longing for more weight loss- and this wasn't the case before people started commenting.

&amp;#x200B;

I needed that off my chest, but I'm also looking for advice. It's a struggle quieting my own mind against ED... but the struggle of standing up to others and quieting their voices in my mentalscape was a challenge I wasn't prepared for. I don't think people will understand if I try to explain, but then again how can I get them to take it seriously and stop fucking talking about it?",

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest this is hard for me to write out so I’m just going to state some facts. I am underweight. I purge at least 3 times a day, and up until recently was running every day as well. Then I became too weak to really continue that and things got worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I am experiencing some health problems, I’m not sure what I am allowed to say but I am very weak. I have been to a doctor who said I was malnourished. He wanted me to come back for weight checks but I never followed up. I have also been seeing a therapist for years (struggled with addiction but been sober for three years!) but I haven’t told her what’s going on regarding my ED. We have therapy over the phone so she hasn’t seen the change in person.

I’m feeling very lost and trapped. I think in patient is extreme, but his concern is worrying me that I am not seeing what he is seeing.

I've been underweight my whole life. I seem unable to gain weight even if I try. I don't really fear gaining weight- maybe a little afraid, but not much just because it seems unlikely that I ever would due to my eating habits.

I also love food. I'm passionate about cooking, baking, etc. Sometimes I have an issue with binging on desserts, and I do so privately so my partner doesn't judge me.

But most of the time, I under eat. I can't tell if I do it on purpose or not. I just take small portions and get anxious if I think about eating more. Sometimes I don't realize it's a small portion until after I take a picture of my food or something and then look at it again. I'll have a couple olives and feel guilty about it. I think the guilt is partially tied into financial reasoning and memories from a child where I was afraid about my parents being poor. If I have a binge eating session, the rest of the day or the next day I'll under eat to make up for the cost of the food I binged on. It's not like I'm in financial trouble now but I starve myself a bit anyway as a punishment or way of making up the lost money. When I'm stressed and having negative thoughts about my self, I'll also avoid eating too punish myself for being stupid or whatever it was that I was thinking negativity about.

I tried a version of a keto diet previously (not for weight loss) and became very obsessive over counting carbs and calories, and weighed everything I ate (including herbs) and tracked it. I think that opened my eyes to my general issue with food restrictions.

So, I want to ask if this sounds like an eating disorder. I'm a bit unsure because I really don't think about my weight much and I don't know if that's makes it not an eating disorder.",

There have been a handful of occasions where this feeling has gotten so bad that I’ve made myself purge, but I mostly find it difficult so I try to purge after I eat somewhat frequently but most of the time I can’t get anything up. I then tend to resort to excessive exercise in the gym, and also when I don’t meet my step goal I feel exceptionally guilty and pace around my room until I get my target. 

I also count calories religiously and get very distressed when other people touch my food or cook for me because I don’t know how accurately I can estimate the calories. I know I have a bad relationship with food and I do talk to a therapist about it but I don’t know if I can call it a full-blown eating disorder because I’m technically overweight by bmi standards (mostly because of the amount of muscle I have as I lift weights 5x a week) and I don’t know if I’d call my weight loss “drastic” I’ve lost xx kg in a few months but then gained it back so I don’t know if I even meet the DSM criteria for Atypical AN. And I don’t know if I purge enough to be considered bulimic. I’m reluctant to self diagnose but I do want to have some sort of label because I always feel so invalid in the ED community.

I’d appreciate anyone’s take on this—Once again, not asking for a diagnosis on here just interested in people’s thoughts on if I am likely to have an ED or not. Thank you x",

Over the last year and a half, I lost weight very quickly. I began taking ritalin for my adhd and it made me nauseous to the point of not eating meals for a day or two at a time. Before that, I was always a healthy weight with some purging episodes when i was \~14 years old, due to body image issues. Those issues remained with me until last year. Now, at 20, I found i lost a lot of weight (especially in my breasts and butt) and feel very badly about myself. I thought i was so overweight before, up until a few months ago, but now realize i looked fine. Now on the other side of the spectrum, I feel very underweight and hate that i think i look underdeveloped for a girl my age.

I don’t know what any of this means, but i do know i am extremely nauseous all the time to the point where even if i want to eat, it’s difficult. I have been trying to gain weight and feel healthy again for almost a year now, but nothing’s changed. In fact, reaching out is partially due to my mom forcing me to weigh myself recently and saw I had somehow lost MORE weight. I haven’t had serious health complications/hospitalizations after losing weight, a few instances of almost-fainting (got better with rest) aside, and don’t know if my situation qualifies as an ED. I hate when people watch me eat (due to social anxiety), am extremely restrictive in intake when i thought i was overweight, and have body dysmorphia with any way i look.

I just dont know, should i definitely talk to my therapist about this? Could it be AFID? Anorexia nervousa? or is it not bad enough to be one of those, and is just disordered eating? Thank you for reading",

I'm currently eating a sandwich while feeling very guilty and like i want to starve myself instead. In the past I've torn bills while hanging out with my friends to not be able to buy good cuz i was so anxious that they were going to see me eat and that I would look disgusting while doing it.

I know that it can be bad for my health but i feel like i deserve this pain cuz i look so ugly.

I’m very fem presenting, but I’m terrified of looking any more womanly than I already do, and to constantly be perceived as a woman. Not eating somehow makes me feel more easy to pass as masc when I want to, but I’m equally as terrified as being seen as masculine as I am to be seen as feminine. I feel trapped in my body all the time because it will never look like how I want it to. It literally does not help that I relate my gender-fluidity more to cisness than transness—I always tell myself that I’m not trans enough and I get so hung up on trying to be female when I just genuinely don’t feel like that, and it’s a never-ending cycle that feeds into my eating disorder. And to make things worse, now I’m stuck in a depressive episode feeling both underwhelmed and overwhelmed with life, and I just wish I didn’t exist. I wish I could just return my life. I don’t want to be here, constantly feeling miserable all the time, wearing a fake smile so people don’t worry too much about me. I don’t know how to ask for help… but here I am, anyway. ):

&amp;#x200B;

Coping with BPD is hard enough as it is… I’ve really been trying to make progress, but it’s like everything triggers me and I completely shut down. My dissociation is at an all-time high. My therapist is concerned I might have OSDD. I’ve been dealing and struggling with traumatic flashbacks more frequently. I feel myself trying to self-destruct because I don’t know what else to do. It’s like little Spongebobs running around my brain, throwing files everywhere, starting a fire. My emotions are off the walls, but I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and numbness more often than not. It’s the complete opposite of my usual positive mindset. I’m scared that my BPD will always be as severe as it is now and I am scared that I will never recover, in any way.",

My loved one says that the BMI scale does not apply to them since they are very tall (it doesn't really apply to anyone) but use this to deny that they are obese. They feel that since the BMI scale doesn't apply to them, there is no way to quantify? I guess? that their weight is too much. They have a very high body fat percentage and never intentionally exercise, and binge eat every day. (things like drinking several liters of soda in one sitting, eating nothing but sweets and pastries some days) They also spend our shared income on these excessive amounts of sweets, they buy a lot at a time and say that they're going to eat them slowly, but go through them in a day and go to restock.

We are unable to see doctors due to the high cost of medical, otherwise I would ask my LO to speak to a doctor about it directly. I live with them and their health does impact my quality of life as they are a caregiver for me.

Recently they had a health scare and it was a concern that their weight/unhealthy diet may have been the root of it, but when the health scare absolved itself on its own with time, they went right back to their habits.

I've talked to them about this before and on some level they understand that they are significantly obese and that even if they weren't, the way they eat is awful for anyone, but they don't want to work on it because then they have to think about it. If it were up to them, they wouldn't do anything productive or good for them (bathe, practice hygiene, exercise, wake up during the day, work), we both have some mental health struggles so I understand where they're coming from and we've both had to push eachother to work on these things.

How do I approach them and help them work on this? If I had a solution for them (a way to transition into eating better, exercising, etc.) and presented it to them in a way that didn't make them feel overwhelmed, they would be willing to work on it.",

Hi. I need some help, but where i'm from there isn't that kind of help available. So i thought why not ask reddit. Like what's there to loose.

Im 165 cm, xx kg (a little more than normal range of BMI). I am currently on a keto diet (kind of). You see, my problem with diets are always the same. I start restricting myself and then I developed an unhealthy relationship with everything im not allowing myself to eat until i reach a breaking point and buy what im not supposed to eat. Eat it, and then purge. Just a few days ago. I was so hungry. I left work, bought stirfry noodles with peanut sauce ate the whole thing then made myself purge..

I am not happy, I am never happy on a diet. I must go on a diet, because I can't limit myself and end up gaining too much weight to the point where I dont feel comfortable and am on the verge of getting diabetes (which a lot of my family members have they also have high blood pressure).

I have tried to get help. But to no avail.. I feel like this is going to be a struggle for ever and I don't know if I can live like this.

I dont know if this is the right place for this post, im kind of hoping it is. Has anyone had the same struggles, and later on over come them?

Doctors I go to have never mentioned me having anorexia or an eating disorder, and advise me to eat high caloric snacks throughout the day.

Everyone in my life has always been very concerned with if I eating disorder because I’m very thin. I always just thought that in the way that I deal with stress was I undereat. Some when they are stressed may eat a lot to cope, but I am the opposite. So, sometimes I’ll be hungry and go out to eat. I’ve always behaved weird when going out to eat. I’ll be hungry, and then the food will come out and I suddenly get turned off by the food (even if it looks good) and have difficulty eating it. I’ll always get a doggie bag to go, and I’ll leave it in the fridge and a day will pass and then it just goes to waste. And people get mad at me when I go out to eat and don’t eat enough. I always feel eyes on me to make sure I’m eating.

I never have counted calories, I do not make myself throw up, I don’t feel guilty. It’s just sometimes eating can feel daunting for me. Like a chore sometimes. I am very busy and i almost try to push off eating because I feel strapped for time a lot.

I think my main concern is that I lose my appetite when a large meal is prepared. But is this disordered eating? I always felt like I had a normal relationship with food. It’s not like I have a massive fear of gaining weight. I wish I was a little bit more curvy, but at the same time I kind of don’t want to get big.

And then people will tell me I have an eating disorder, and that “you just don’t know it”. It makes me upset because I don’t know what the truth is. I will say sometimes others can help give direction at times, but this is something I’ve experienced for a very long time. I don’t know what to do. I grew up with people making fun of me or embarrassing me for being thin and saying I’m “bulimic” and I have never, ever done that. I’ve gotten a lot of comments on my body by friends, partners, and family. It makes me feel gross.

What do I do? Does anyone have advice for how to deal with this? I’m genuinely trying to understand why I get turned off or nauseous around food. It’s like I will take a few bites, feel nauseous and stop. Or feeling very bloated. But it isn’t something emotional I think? I don’t feel “fat” or “gross”. If anything I watch mukbangs to help encourage me to eat more and think less.",

My sister just said she won't eat today because she wants to get skinnier

I'm 20, and she's 12. My eating disorder started that way at 12, I thought I wouldn't eat for a day, after that, I haven't lived a day obsessing over food.

My mom, who probably has some form of Ed herself, talks often about losing weight. My sister is a bit chubby, however not overweight. My mom says that my sister, me and her all need to lose a bit of weight, even though my mom is skinny. On the other hand, I'm overweight. I messed myself up so bad that losing any weight is extremely hard.

I constantly think about food and any little things trigger me. I don't want my sister to suffer the same way I did. I tried talking to my mom, tried telling her not to tell my sister to lose weight, but she said that she thinks it's good if my sister starts thinking about weight, and being healthy.

I think that it's my mom's responsibility, as a parent to adjust my sisters diet, and not tell her she's fat. It breaks my heart. When I was 12, my mom told me that I was obese, and I believed her. I wasn't. I recently looked back at my old pictures and I was a normal kid. Not even necessarily fat.

I think she tries to ignore that time when I had anorexia and wouldn't eat for weeks straight, and at one point I couldn't even eat anymore, my doctor said that I would be hospitalised if I lose 4 more pounds. She never talked to me about that after I gained weight back, like it never happened, like I was always fat and disgusting and lazy bitch.

I don't know what to do to help my sister, as I don't know what I need to be helped",

hi! i’m really sorry if this triggers anyone and if  you feel like it will just click off. anyways i’m confused if i just  have bad habits and “disordered eating”, not necessarily an eating  disorder.

basically i just moved away from my friends which isn’t great and  caused a lot of stress, i never really ate a lot before but i still had  the basic 2-3 meals. now i don’t even have that much, only some drinks  and a snack. i used to think it’s cause i was just stressed and i’d get  back to normal eventually but i haven’t. the real problem started when i  tried to get my eating back to normal but i just couldn’t, i’d feel so  guilty when ever i tried to eat a decent meal ,, so i just wouldn’t.  it’s never got to regular purging and it’s not like food is the only  thing i can ever think about so i don’t know if it’s an actual  disorder??? or just “disordered eating” because of a shitty situation  that spiralled out of control. i’m really scared that one day it’ll get  seriously bad and ruin my life and i won’t be able to do anything about  it.

It started a month or so ago- at least, that's when I began to notice that she'd lost a LOT of weight in an abnormally short period of time. Upon enquiring about her health, I realised that she hadn't been eating at all. Later, as I probed, I realised that she had been getting through her days on coffee and refusing to eat because ""food looks nauseating"".

She recently had issues with an irregular period as well, but they couldn't find any abnormalities in her physiological functioning as a cause. It is suspected to be a lack of nutrition, which leads me to believe that this issue may have been going on for longer than I thought it did.

I was a bit harsh, and might have overstepped because I was worried- I first tried to make her eat by asking her constantly about breakfast, lunch and dinner to make sure she didn't forget. I did not realise that this could be an eating disorder at first. I assumed she simply wasn't prioritising food enough and wanted her to take care of herself.

Later I realised that it was a lot more serious than that, and although I had tried not to, I was concerned that I was guilttripping her, which could do more harm than good. I apologised, and I don't ask aggressively about her food intake anymore- however, I feel like any efforts that she might have made when I did, have completely dropped now. She's been experiencing a cold feeling and dizziness at random times now. I'm quite worried.

My friend and I don't live in the same area anymore, so I feel a little less helpful than I could be, although we talk almost everyday. She's been in therapy for anxiety before, but her parents withdrew her a year or so ago. We don't know if they would be open to reconsideration since they're having issues with medical insurance right now. She recently started going on the pill for period correction, but it had a negative effect so they stopped her.

I know I shouldn't use Google as a diagnosis tool, but her symptoms seem to closely match that of Avoidant Food Intake Disorder. She complains that eating food makes her want to puke, and the thought of eating scares her abnormally. She's worried that eating food will make her feel sick, and she avoids eating because ""she's worried there'll be leftovers that she'll have to eat later"". Whenever she does eat, it seems to be tiny portions of random snacks that have no nutritional value- which probably increases the sick feeling.

Can someone give me tips on how to help her get into eating better and help her hold out until she can get therapy? Although she hasn't expressed much annoyance, I don't want to be overbearing- but her parents have given up on her eating breakfast and aren't aware that she isn't eating much else for the rest of the day.

I'm trying my best to emotionally support her, telling her that how she feels towards food isn't ridiculous in any way, and that her struggle is valid.

My girlfriend is an anorexic in recovery. She has recently gained some weight after being weight restored for a couple of years and wants to lose a bit of the weight. I want to support her in whatever she wants her body to look like but I want to make sure she is healthy and not slipping back into dangerous habits. What can I do to help, support and just generally look out for her safety since I know food and weight are a very touchy subject for everyone, especially her.

I'm not sure this is the community to ask this too but if not, if y'all could redirect me, that would be great! I really just want to help her feel as beautiful as I think she is but I would be lying if I said I wasn't worried.

I’ve been doing so well… I went to a treatment program two years ago and I felt “cured”. I felt like nothing could ever make me restrict or use any ED behaviors again. I thought I was free.

A few months ago I started birth control pills, to prevent pregnancy. For many reasons I am not comfortable with other methods of birth control, like the non hormonal iud for example. The pill is pretty commonly reported to cause weight gain. I went into it telling myself that it would be ok, I could handle any changes that happened, it was worth not getting pregnant, etc. I learned that the hormones really just make you hungrier, they don’t magically make you gain weight.

However, learning this fact has made me so untrusting of my hunger cues ever since I started. I’m not consciously restricting but it’s like every time I’m hungry outside of a meal I just ignore it because I blame it on the pill and not my actual hunger. I don’t measure food anymore but I feel I have been eating less, but telling myself it’s not ED related. “Oh it’s just stress” “oh it’s the nausea from the pill” etc.

I don’t really body check anymore but I do own a mirror, and I wear clothes (lol). I don’t want to mention anything specific but now I’m noticing that little body checks I would have done a few years ago would make me very pleased, if I were to engage in them today. I don’t own a scale but it seems I’m losing weight pretty quickly again. I know I need to just force myself to eat despite the nausea, despite the stress, despite the fear of the birth control making me “too hungry”… but something in me is scared. I’m so angry at myself for being scared. I did it before. Why is weight gain still so scary to me? How can I get past this?",

I'll start by saying I'm already in contact with a therapist's office and waiting for them to get back to me once my insurance is processed. It's been two days now, so I'm going to call them tomorrow, because I think this might be the beginning of something I need to catch early.

I've always had body-image issues. I grew up with a father that made comments on my weight very often, even though I was never overweight as a child. I'm in my early twenties now, and overweight, and every time I come home, he comments in some way. Usually it's a comment on when/how much I'm eating. A few years ago, when I was a teenager, I started restricting under the recommended minimum. I stopped because I was recovering from an alcohol addiction and wanted to be honest about every aspect of my life. I've tried to lose weight more times than I count, and every time it ends in me giving up on the calorie counting and binging, sometimes for long periods, which has contributed to my weight gain. I'm told by my friends and men that ""it suits me"" and that they don't think I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop equating ""skinny"" with ""pretty."" But, more than that, now that I think about it. Worthy.

So, it started with that cycle again, just me deciding to count calories, but within the recommended range. And then I saw a pro-ED Tiktok, and then I sought out that kind of content, and started restricting far too much again. I've had physical symptoms now and it's scaring me. The thing that's scaring me the most is that I have tried to stop, and I can't. Now, the thought of food honestly fills me with dread. It truly feels easier to just be hungry than eat. I have done well these past two days, meeting the recommended minimum. I have a friend that's been checking in with me. The weird thing that's helped with it is intermittent fasting. It's like if I tell myself, ""Okay, you have to eat, and you have to eat enough, but only in this 8 hour period,"" it's doable, at least for now. But I'm terrified of what I might lower myself to tomorrow.

So I finally called a therapist. The thing is, I'm really afraid to be honest with her. I'm graduating college in a year, and it's been rough ride for me. I've been hospitalized for depression several times, and although I'm grateful that those inpatient stays saved my life, they did disrupt my life, especially my academic life. I can't bear the thought of losing what I've worked so hard for (to clarify, I'm taking classes right now to graduate on time). If I tell her how low I've been restricting (I'm trying not to use numbers, and I'm sorry if I'm getting too specific with what I have said), I'm afraid that she'll IVC me. I'm not underweight, again, I'm actually a good bit overweight, and I can't see any emergent symptoms right now - I also am not having any suicidal ideations.

I'm sorry, because I think I'm partially coming here for validation. I feel like I can't have an eating disorder because I'm overweight. I know if I were to tell my family, they would tell me that I'm ruining everything I've almost lost before, and the thing that kills me is I KNOW I am. I know why I shouldn't be doing this, and I'm still doing it. I ate enough today and yesterday, but I'm still spending so much time on those sites. And I still feel pretty when I'm hungry while I'm fasting. This is something, much like alcohol (which I haven't consumed in three years), I just don't think I know how to fix on my own. If I'm told that she probably will commit me, honestly, that's fine. I'll go and I'll be honest anyway, because I have to be alive to graduate. I just would like to know what to expect. It's also good motivation, in a macabre way, to eat enough in the days leading up to meeting with her. Any suggestions people have that have worked for them to get themselves to eat are more than welcome. I want to eat, I do, I'm just afraid of it. I'm thinking of calling my best friend and asking if I could send her my calorie counts at the end of each day for accountability, but I don't know if that's crossing boundaries too much - I don't want to make someone else feel responsible for my safety. She's a sweetheart and I know she'd say yes but I don't want to be codependent with her. I'm just trying to think of ways to stay safe until I can get some help, and I don't know that fasting is the right way to do it. That could spiral, too.

Sorry, this has gone on forever.

TL;DR - I'm going to a therapist about restricting my intake too low and I'm afraid she'll IVC me. I'm asking for experience on getting yourself to eat when you're afraid to do so, and also wondering if fasting could put me in more danger even though it's helping right now.",

Hello. I’ll be honest, 4 months into recovery, and I still can’t accept how my body has changed. I’m having daily panic attacks over my shape during trips to the bathroom. I’m also distressing knowing that all of this anxiety hasn’t gotten me to stop eating like I want. It feels like every waking hour of my life is spent dealing with nagging thoughts about eating and hunger. I’m insatiable, and I’m now the biggest that I have ever been.

Nonetheless, I saw to my ED specialist today, and she wasn’t concerned about my weight or my eating. She specifically quashed my fear that I might be bingeing, so now I’m not sure how to deal with my appetite and changing body. All I want to do is go on a diet to lose weight, but everyone—from my doctor to my therapist to my girlfriend to my own inner voice—is telling me I shouldn’t do that. They all say, “embrace your curves,” but how do I even do that when I’ve wanted to be skinny for so many years?",

I’m currently grappling with a full fledged eating  disorder for the first time in my life, but I’m going to therapy and  really trying to overcome it. 

I have a very small circle of friends because of life circumstances.  One of these friends I see every now and then, she usually suggests  dinner or a drink which of course is extremely difficult for me. 

During the meal, she will mention several times that she either A)  did not eat at all until then, B) she worked out intensively that day,  or C) that will be all she eats for the day. 

Obviously, these comments are really triggering to me. I’m so  desperately trying to overcome my behavior of restricting food, but  whenever I’m out with her, she acts like it’s a normal part of every day  life. 

To my knowledge she does not have an eating disorder; she is just  insanely competitive about everything. In the past, she’s asked me about  how much money I make, tried to see if me and my boyfriend have gotten  in any fights, or even pried into any family issues I might be having  (her family situation is super rocky). I’ve suspected for years that she  has always tried to make things a competition between us and I can’t  stand it. 

How do you suggest I handle this situation? She’s a nice friend to  hang out with every now and then when the conversation doesn’t involve  how little she ate that day.",

Is this an eating disorder? I'm sorry in advance if this triggers you So, in the past few months there’s been a ton of shit happening in my life. Family issues, friend issues, my ex tried to commit suicide, it’s just been a lot.

I’ve been struggling with this for a while and my love ones have noticed, and I’ve asked them for help but I’m not sure if it’s just body dysmorphia?

I feel super panicked to eat certain foods, Let me give an example,

The other day, my best friend and my family and I went out to dinner. I had a swim meet and the only thing I had to eat before that was coffee, and one of those low calorie fiber one bars. I did go to work and I ran to target and I purchased 4 Alani nu energy drinks and two boxes of the fiber one bars, and some other non related food things but it was a lot of money I had spent on food.

My best friend came over before we went to dinner and she made a pop tart in my toaster. I told her she was crazy for eating one of those because they are full of sugar and I read this thing that someone literally died from eating one of those. Those things are just cookies basically. And she knows about my eating habits because its gotten better but then I would fall back into the bad path again. She asked me why I was freaking out about those damn pop tarts and I just said they are so bad for you. And she was like well yeah, but you gotta live a little sometimes dude. I said, yes I know.

When we got to dinner, the only thing I ordered was a side salad, which was xxx calories which was perfect for me. She ordered a thing of chicken wings and fries. She tried to put a couple fries on my plate and I quickly told her no. It was a different type of fear that I had felt. She was like, “ok dude.”

I was over at her house last night and her mom made dinner. I was a bit anxious to eat because I went to the gym after swim practice yesterday and I really didn’t want to waste all the calories I had just burned. I just decided to eat a little, because I knew she would flip shit if I didn’t eat, and so would her parents. I put 2 tiny pieces of the little chicken breast and maybe a tablespoon of the salad. Her mom noticed, she says “you eat like bird! Is that enough for you?” My friend says,”She used to eat more.” And then proceeded to give me a really hard look. I told her I’m fine and she doesn’t need to worry. I finished my dinner, and I was helping her do dishes and she was talking about how a milkshake would sound so good. And I told her “ew no” she said,”you used to love those, why doesn’t anything sound good to you anymore?” I said “I don’t know.” And I told her again not to worry and that I was fine and she worries way too much, which she does sometimes😂

We went to the grocery store and I was helping her shop and we were in the ice cream isle and I was so anxious. She’s my best friend, so sometimes we do stupid stuff, this time, I was sitting inside the cart. I was very tired and I was zoning out, that’s why I didn’t want to walk. She was talking about dessert, and I made a face. And she goes,”are you a sugarphobic now?” I feel like I am lol. And I said idk, and then I brushed it off again.

A few hours later My stomach was hurting a lot, so I was laying on her bedroom floor. She asked me if I was ok and I said yes. She told me that I could go home if I wanted to, and I told her I was fine. We were talking and my brain kept wandering and I kept forgetting what I was talking about. She went to the kitchen and got an ice cream bar, I said,”how can you eat one of those things” and she was like because they are good, and you should have one too. And I said,”no I’m tired and I’m going home” so I got up and then I said, are you going to walk me out? Bc she always does! And she said no. I mean it was fine. But I guess I can’t tell if she’s mad?",

Hi there, F34, first time here on reddit. I have recently come to the conclusion that I have an eating disorder, I'd say it's some sort of anorexia, but I only ever find resources about anorexia nervosa, which I think is not my issue. My problematic relationship with food is rather a consequence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and ADHD. I've had episodes of complete loss of appetite since I was a teenager, sometimes it would last days, sometimes weeks, but it would always be linked to some sort of preoccupation that led to anxiety (important exam, new job, heart break and such). I've had only one episode of some sort of bulimia, where I would feel hungry all of the time, which lasted about a month. In the end I never worried too much about it, because it would last a limited amount of time, and then things would go back to normal. But this year has been different. It's obviously been a tough year, psychologically speaking. But I first noticed a weight loss upon getting a serious parasitic infection, which makes sense. The problem is I never quite recovered appetite, cause depression and anxiety piled up, and then I started medication that also tends to lower appetite. Work has been really tough (I'm doing a PhD overseas), and the work load and stress is just too much for me to actually care to think about food. All in all, I lost xxkg in less than a year (I'm 1m64 tall, and went from yykg to xxkg, which makes it 20%). In the past months I've also been exercising quite a bit, for I took dance classes that helped me cope with stress. Right now I'm trying to get into healthier habits, chill a bit, dedicate more time to my crafting hobbies, etc. I'v gotten more appetite, but when I do eat complete meals I end up feeling stomach sick, I guess because my body's not used to it anymore. So I guess what I need help with is, how to go back to a healthy diet, given that I've spent months eating very little, and that I have little free time and the whole ""planning for meals, going to the super, cooking, doing the dishes etc"" seems pretty overwhelming to me? What easy/quick/healthy food could I get? Any other recommendation or resource welcome. Thank you.",

I mentioned to my therapist on our call yesterday the fact that I really think I might have an ED. She agrees that there’s something up and we went through her little diagnosis book and answered all the questions for each. I was kinda leaning towards it being one thing but she really feels like it’s just unspecified. I’m a little confused now I guess. If it’s unspecified how do you know how to treat it? She also kept saying I wasn’t an unhealthy weight which was kinda invalidating because while yes I’m not currently an unhealthy weight I’ve lost a LOT of what I did weigh and I’m on the way to being underweight. I want to get a handle on this but I feel kinda discouraged that it isn’t anything really specific because it still just means I don’t know how to deal with it. I’m supposed to go on vacation to my absolute favorite place here in two weeks and I know I won’t cure my ED in two weeks I’d like to get motivated to start working on it and enjoying the food I used to love so much while I’m there.

&amp;#x200B;

My experience- I don’t really get super hungry anymore, nothing also sounds good. Sometimes I can think of a single thing that I could eat in that moment but it’s usually like something really specific and then when I get it sometimes it’s fine (I still only eat half) and other times I eat a few bites and it’s as repulsive as everything else sounded. I know I need to eat but I can’t find anything and then I have a panic attack. But at 11:30 at night I go ugh I’m hungry and I make a chocolate pop tart and a glass of milk even though the rest of the day food gives me anxiety or I just don’t care enough to eat. I also struggle with wanting to spend the money especially when I don’t finish anything I eat it feels like a waste (I try to do leftovers but I eat so irregularly that they go bad before I get to them or I just don’t want them)",

I now f19 have had issues with appetite since I was 15. Around 15 I started becoming underweight, because my appetite left. It’s like everything taste like card bored or makes me gag or has a really bad texture or taste, even if I love the food, because of the fact that I have no appetite.

Cannabis is the only thing that has helped me, I practically can’t eat without it. It’s helped me gain weight some. But now, even with the Cannabis it’s like my appetite issues it fighting through it, and My stomach isn’t able to eat as much. Im loosing weight again and it’s worrying me and I also feel weak all the time now, I feel like I’m starving all the time. I get this wave of nausea and a pit in my stomach a lot too, and I’ve realized it’s from hunger. I just want to enjoy my food and pig out. But I can’t. Now I’m also dizzy/nauseous through my eyes. This started when the appetite issues started up again. It feels like I’m stuck on a fair ride the ones that make you sick.

I am very uneducated about ED’s, but from my understanding, you normally care ALOT about your weight or body image and that causes you to shift your food and eating tendicies… my mom and brother and boyfriend all think what’s going on with me is an eating disorder.. but i don’t really care if I’m skinny or midsize… so Can it really be one? I hope this doesn’t come off as rude or dumb… I’m genuinly concerned.

I have celiac disease RA, fibromyalgia and pots as well. Not that’s Thats relevant to this sub...",

I knew about this then and then she got better, for a while  She never spoke about it much and she helped me through depression for years but didn't speak about her own struggle really. For the last two years she and I haven't been home together so I didn't know she wasn't well again, but a few days ago we came back home for the summer and I heard her vomiting in the bathroom after dinner.. It threw me back to when we were younger and I didn't know what to do except stand rock still behind the locked door and think emptily, until she opened the door and I acted like nothing happened or I left before she opened it. So there I was again, standing there like an idiot. I want to help so bad, especially cuz she's done so much for me and I love her infinitely, But behind a locked door I couldn't really stop her from vomiting and obviously that's not a thing

I’ve been overweight for a large chunk of my life. I’m also in a community that is not very body positive and I feel so out of place, even thought I’m in a caring relationship and have wonderful friends that support me.

During the pandemic, I would yo-yo between a couple different numbers but even when I was losing weight at a healthy weight, I still didn’t LIKE myself and I would then swing into the other end of overeating, until I was full, and then just KEPT GOING.

Now that the world is opening back up again, I’m trying to be better about what I eat, and I’m scared that I’m undereating and overworking at the gym, or underworking and overeating and it just makes me feel like garbage.

binged yesterday, but today I bounced back. Hello [r/BingeEatingDisorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder), this is the first time I wirte here. I am 18M and normal weight right now I am not very active due to an overtraining injury that didn't heal properly (another binging problem I had, but that's another story). I don't have a binge eating disorder to the extent that some poeple on this sub have, but I do have my fair share of struggles with food, hunger and satiety, and to a lesser extent body Image. It is 10pm as I'm writing this post, and I feel like I wanted to share this story.

me, my mother (who BTW lost a lot of weight in 2018-2019) and her husband (not my dad, my mom is a single mother) are right now at a hotel. the hotel has breakfast and dinner. on thursday my family went to a restaurant, and I ate a pretty hefty meal around 5pm. then there was dinner and I was not hungry, so I ate a small dinner bc I know that if I don't eat something in the evening, I can't fall asleep (yes, it sucks). It was around xxx calories. friday morning (yesterday) I ate for breakfast a huge meal, and for dinner, It was a motherfucking feast. *meal details deleted*. I was absolutely conscious about that (although not completely under my control), and it was planned ahead (I told myself ""fuck it, I'll just eat undtil I'm stuffed because this is food that Isn't readily available at home usually"") after the meal I was stuffed as hell, and had a few mini-pukes. I told myself, while looking in the mirror and having my camera on ""I am worried for you [u/nothereforupvotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/nothereforupvotes), I don't want you to develop and eating pattern like this, of eating until you are stuffed and gaining fat. tomorrow you will eat 2 slices of bread, a small container of cottage cheese, an egg, and a lot of veggies, maybe a small savory pastry (kid of a trigger but I ate only a small one). understood?"" I didn't beat myself up as much (and when I did, I said ""this is an alarm going off, that something isn't right. I can do this without beating myself up"") which is an achievement bc I used to beat myself up after occasions like that"". "" then went outside for a little bit, wrote down my thoughts and feelings about this event and other events throughout the day, and then got into a convo with a friendly couple that also slept in the hotel. woke up at around 9am today (saturday), went to breakfast with my mom and kept that promise.was full, but not stuffed. then around 2pm there was lunch and I slightly overate (more than I planned) but not to the extent of what happened on friday It was much better. an hour ago I ate a large salad and a small bowl of mac&amp;cheese. I was proud of myself for bouncing back and not going to the other extreme like I see other people do on this sub. I am really happy for myself for not purging/starving like othe people would do, and wanted to share some tips that when I do have a successful time managing my eating.

find passions unrelated to food, or at least not eating it. music (huge one for me), hobbies, skills, shows on TV.

hard AF, but try to be compassionate with yourself. Instead as labeling yourself as a ""pig"" or a ""fatso)"" but telling yourself ""I have a problem, and it sucks. I want to have better habits and be able to control myself.

prepare your meals ahead of time, and eat low calorie dense foods that taste average to good, so they won't be extremely disgusting to the point of not being able to stick long term, but not extremely delicious so you'll be able to stop.

find an accountability partner with the same interest (for me it's my mom who tries to maintain a healthy weight and has a history with being overweight)

try and understand the root of your binges. maybe it's lack of other interests other than food, boredom, FOMO (a huge reason for me) trauma, mental health disorders, etc. I don't want to be a holier-than-thou, rather give people hope, BC this sub is at times very pessimistic.

tl;dr- went to a hotel, gorged insane amounts of food in the span of 30 hrs, but held myself accountable and bounced back with a healthy and relatively small breakfast, avoiding compensatory behavior.

good week everyone, peace&amp;love.",

I went home and went to bed, thinking maybe that inconvenience was a blessing in disguise. But even today so far I'm so tempted to just go smash through some drive thru food. I havnt given in, but it just seems like now it's so difficult to resist it. Asking people that have recovered, how long did it take for the urges to subside? Do they ever go away or is this a life long battle?

Hi all,

My boyfriend was decently overweight before we started dating. He lost many many pounds very very fast over the course of 3-4 months by restrictive eating with no exercise. Though, because we were close friends at the time, and I saw him every day it didn't immediately hit me that he was losing weight extremely fast.

After those 3-4 months we started dating, and we've been together for 6 months. He's still losing weight, even though he really doesn't need to anymore. I try to be supportive and suggest regular healthy meals; but he doesn't eat more than once a day. I'm fairly sure his diet is causing him other health issues as well, but he's yet to make a doctor's appointment.

It's gotten a bit worse now since some COVID restrictions have been lifted, and he's started going to the gym on top of this. I'm just worried that this might get out of hand, and I'd rather try to stop it from getting any worse.

Quick background - early 40s, F, single and I have had an ED (to my estimation) for the past 12 years. about 8 years ago my girfriends had an intervention with me about my weight loss and my size and were concerned for my health (which I was able to concede eventually at the time, I was indeed suffering from an ED and it was causing health problems) I also agreed at the time to understand ED's are not ever cured but instead we must be consciously aware of them for life. 

I then began to gain weight again (yoyo up time) and silly me forgot EDs  life long hold. I proved overtime my ED was in fact NOT all behind me. 

About 5 years went by and I was realizing I had begun to swing the other way. I was a junk food addict.  I up-ed my exercise to stop the gain (blame excercise not food) but it did nothing.  Then it peaked last year (adding in the pandemic) and sadly I had gained too much, my health was starting to suffer from over-weight problems. So I decided 2021 would be a year to rectify and get back to healthy again. To find a happy medium. And to make myself accountable for it and do it consciously! 

So never being a stranger to EDs, I made my healthy meal plan, spoke to one of my GFs to be my moderator/ sponsor (AKA - she would hold me accountable to be safe while loosing, and report me if I was being unsafe.) I also refused to be a scale hugger (only weigh in once a month - not 3 times a day like before) and tried to go at this safe.  And its worked! I hit my goal weight this month. I am so grateful for my friends and family to help me, but its not over yet sadly.  And being at the ""healthy"" finish line, I have hit a snag. 

Problem is I have passed my loss limit (not by much) but I am still dropping. My GF sponsor is fully aware and I just told her the numbers (nothing to concerning but its notable). I want to tell her and my doctor that I will stop loosing, but I am worried I won't know how.  I started adding calories back to stop it but its not helping. 

Therefore, I'm hoping someone here has healthy ways to begin a maintaining weight plan. (not so much calories/ foods/ exercise) but perhaps tips around times I eat, or exercise. Or skills around making sure I don't panic about a pound here or there fluctuations. Since I am concerned about the loss, I am planning to weigh myself more often to make sure I'm stabilizing but I am fearful of a relapse (becoming a hugger again). 

As I am sure  others on here can vouch for, being the size and weight you want *SHOULD* be time to be happy and proud. I am sadly not feeling this, instead I feel a bit stressed knowing that I am no longer in a loose mode/ (or gain mode) and I never tried to find a ""happy or stabilizing"" mode. Is there anything I can do to be happy and confident as I am sure stress is not going to help this process. 

Any advice most welcome. TY",

Hi, long story. I was always big, over the course of a year or so i lost a massive amount of weight, made bad choices in the way i lost it etc. I've maintained my love for fitness and not just for looks but also performance.

I've tried everything - stopped and started calorie counting countless times, read and tried to utilise books, researched online etc. I've lost hope. I haven't regained all the weight, only about a quarter of it so far. But it's killing me seeing myself undo the one good thing i was proud of.

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 5 years, and he’s seen me at my worst. My ED made me extremely sick a couple years ago and that was what got me to realize that I actually had a problem and I had to get better, it was a very long journey that brought me to giving up diets forever for the sake of staying in recovery. I’ve gained weight, but I’ve been more confident and in love with my body than I’ve ever been and I’ve just been feeling so much better mentally and physically.
It’s only been a year though, and I still have bad mental health days sometimes and I do get triggered when I see or hear people speak about diets, numbers on nutrition labels, or weight loss/gain, but for my sake no in in my life brings these topics up, including him. However he’s always been really self conscious about his body lately. he’s very attractive, thin with a muscular build, and tall, but he’s from a family where every women has an ED and is very fat phobic. He’s very body positive and not fat phobic towards me or anybody else, but lately I’ve noticed him body checking himself a LOT. Every time he walks by the mirror, he looks at his body from all angles and sees how far his stomach is sticking out, he does this more times a day than I can count. We’ll be watching TV and he’ll get up to do this and then immediately go back and sit down. He also started skipping breakfast, and when I try to get him to eat something he says he’s not hungry, and most days he’ll skip lunch too and claim he just forgot. He confessed sometimes he tries to see how long he can go without eating, just out of “curiosity” but I think it’s more than that. He has noticeably lost weight, despite the fact that he was already thin to begin with. 
A couple nights ago I told him the fasting and small amounts of food he’s eating was worrying me and I asked if he was dieting. He said “to be honest every time I look at my stomach I feel disgusted, but I’m not doing anything about it”. There’s a scale at his dad’s house and he confessed that he’s been weighing himself every time he goes over, and sometimes he visits just to do that. I told him this wasn’t normal, and that I was limited on my abilities to help him without getting triggered, but I needed to know that he was going to bring this up to his therapist. He refused to bring it up in therapy and then agreed he just wouldn’t talk to me about it. I don’t know what to do, I’m scared he’s going to go down the path that took me so long to get away from, I don’t know how much responsibility to take or what I can do without risking my own relapse. I’ve already been struggling a lot just by noticing these behaviors and especially noticing his weight loss, it’s made me feel that like competitive feeling that makes me feel like I need to lose more weight than he has.

My post is as follows: 

I have always struggled with my relationship with food. At the age I became aware of my body and the concept of an “attractive” and an “unattractive” body (i.e 12 y o), I started either eating in extremes as a reward or I would eat scantily for months as a suffering to look a certain way. 

I’m 30 now and but this habit seems to stay. There is a lot of emotional eating and withholding involved. Because of it, I have had to face a myriad of health issues. I got pancreatitis and it gets flared with high fatty food. So either I don’t eat at all, or I eat a lot of high fat content food that has triggered many pancreatitis episodes. Similarly with exercise…either I over-exert myself or I don’t exercise for months altogether. 

Food is not a means to survive for me but a means of enjoyment or punishment. I’m in therapy and this is the realization I have reached. But nothing has come out of it. Unfortunately, there has been throughout my life, a lot of fat shaming from near and dear ones. But I feel like I made space in my life for the comments, I engaged with them so I am part of the problem here. 

I would really appreciate your thoughts and any tips on how to rethink my relationship with food and what are your eating habits like?

I want to know how to help her, I hope this is the right sub. Apologies if it isn't, please do guide me to one that can help if possible. 
Since the pandemic started, my sister began to restrict her meals (she still takes three meals a day but she admits that it's only because of how strict my parents are about making sure we don't skip meals). She started to exercise regularly, which seemed fine. Over the course of last year, she lost a bunch of weight visibly and my (very South Asian, not too sensitive) family made sure they told her how much they've noticed it. When she went back to school, her friends and teachers commented on it too (which made her feel worse, as she told me, ""Does this mean I was really that fat?"")
I had been feeling strange about it and so have my parents, because she used to snack earlier and give in to cravings and now she completely stopped any of that. There were multiple fights over it. Now, she has confessed to me that she's acknowledging that her relationship with food is strained. She has been counting calories on an app for months and even when she deletes the app, she often remembers by now what dish is worth how many calories. She cried to me and said that she thinks she's going to get worse. She also explained that she sometimes spits her food out in the bathroom (no throwing up) because she feels guilty with every spoon that she takes in. On the days she does not exercise, she feels guilty about eating anything at ALL. Basically, it is something that has been bothering her, disrupting her everyday functioning, and actively visible in the way she continues to reduce her eating.
I haven't experienced anything like this in this magnitude. I really want to help her (and she also does want to help herself), just don't know how. I told her that the next time she wants to spit her food out, she should come to me and we will swallow a bite together. And when she is craving chocolate but is stopping herself, to take a small piece and swallow it with me. I'm not sure if it is helpful but I wanted some tips/guidance on how to help someone who may show signs of a developing ED or simply a deteriorating relationship with eating. Thank you.",

I have struggled in the past on and off with disordered eating (most closely resembling BN, but never sought diagnosis, just recovery). My most recent and most severe lapse was last year during quarantine, wasn't fun. 

With the help of my therapist and husband I managed to stop all behaviors, as I knew I wanted to start a family and my body needed to be able to support a baby. I gained a lot of weight obviously, reaching an overweight BMI, and felt very uncomfortable in my body. Then I got pregnant. 

My morning sickness was bad, and I ended up genuinely unintentionally losing a lot of weight in my first trimester. This I think is what triggered me, the weight loss felt fantastic. I was miserable of course I felt like I had the flu for nearly 2 months straight, but I was weighing myself every week to track how much I'd lost. Sometimes if I had a good day and could eat a lot of food, instead of being happy for the calories I managed to get in to fuel me and baby, I would agonize on whether to resort to old behaviors to compensate. I never did, thankfully. I've been able to put me and baby ahead of ED, but...it was harder than I'd like to admit to make that decision sometimes.

Now my nausea is gone and I feel great, and I know I'm going to start gaining soon, which is GOOD because you need to gain a certain amount in pregnancy for a healthy baby, even if you have an overweight BMI like I do. But even at a lower weight now than when I got pregnant...I'm starting to show, my belly is bigger. But I honestly just look...fatter than before. It doesn't look like im pregnant yet properly. I just have a big tum.

And im just suddenly so disgusted by my body again. I hate it. Not even just my belly, everything I can hate thr size of and want smaller, I do. I've always heard how pregnancy really makes you appreciate your body and see it in a  new way because its creating life...but I feel fat and ugly and I just want to keep losing weight. I'm avoiding scales because I'm scared at how upset I will be. But when I have to weigh myself at the doctor every time that number is seared into my brain.

I guess I just wanted to get out there how im feeling, and see if anyone has been in the same boat, and has any words of wisdom or advice for me because I feel like one heckin failure right now for having these thoughts even though I love my little baby in there and want him to be healthy and happy. I want to do, and eat whatever it takes, but im scared of my own thoughts and scared that even though so far I've been able to push through and do what I gotta do...that one day ill fuck up. 

I wanted to feel in love with my body, not be thrown back into destructive ED thoughts. 

Thanks for listening, and for any advice or experience anyone can share.",

I (15f) have been struggling with a restrictive ED for over a year now. This led me to becoming extremely underweight and in a life-threatening condition. I had numerous deficiencies, amenorrhea, hypotension, bradycardia, and was at risk of heart failure. If I’d continued like I was, I knew I would probably die, but I had trouble caring. It was only seeing how devastated my parents were when my family doctor had me admitted to the hospital that I decided to comply with recovery. I chose it for them, not me. Stress got my heart rate up enough for me to leave inpatient quickly, though, and return home. About a month and a half later, this is still the case. I’ve more than doubled my caloric intake, but my parents and paediatrician want me to consume over a thousand more than I am now for rapid weight gain.

I can’t bring myself to do it, but my parents are counting calories and serving me food to ensure that I eat as much as they want. I’ve been lying and I feel absolutely awful for what I’m doing, but I can’t bring myself to stop. I’ve turned to either pouring drinks down the sink, flushing it down the toilet, or feeding it to my dogs (when safe for them) to avoid eating food. Has anyone else experienced this compulsion? I’m desperate to stop. I’m literally flushing money down the drain, and soon enough some doctor is gonna catch on that I’m not gaining as much as I should be.

Note that I am still eating enough to gain weight. I think I’m just scared of surrendering control and eating this much and not being able to stop once I’m at a healthy weight— I’m scared of spiralling out of control. Although I’m still eating enough, I’m still heavily restricting. I eat pretty much the exact same things every day, never daring to try something new, still counting calories (real calories, not the lies my parents know) and still can’t get out of the ashamed mentality that I have for eating.

I just despise myself for what I’m wasting when all my parents are trying to do is help me in every way they can. I don’t know how to fight this.",

I have an 11 year old daughter who has a limited number of foods she will eat. It has been like this since she was 2. Over the years the list has changed but has been very, very limited. She has an extreme fear of trying new food. I thought she would grow out of it, her doctor and dietician thought the same but if this is an eating disorder I want to get her the help she needs now. The wait list for her to speak with a counsellor/therapist is long where I live so I need to get on this but I can’t figure out if it falls in the category. 


I do apologize if this post offends anyone as I know that there are much more serious disorders out there and this might seem trivial but I’ve tried everything I can think of including “Eat what I make or eat nothing at all” and that results in her eating nothing at all for several days. 

If this is an ED and it has a name could someone kindly point me in the right direction so that I may begin research to help my girl?

Thank you all in advance.",

I’ve never posted here before and haven’t been able to find anything in the sub about the specific issue I am going through. So both my friend and I have eating disorders. Her disorder is more severe than mine so I have always made it a priority to not engage in behaviors/talk about things that may be triggering to her. However, recently I don’t think she is doing the same for me. I’ve recently noticed that in Snapchat she is clearly sending me photos where she is body checking and showing off the weight she lost (also including numbers) specifically choosing angles that show the size of her waist etc. I love having a friend who gets what I’m going through and understands having issues with food but I can’t help but wonder if it’s doing more harm than good. Is anyone else dealing with something similar? I feel really alone...I tried to talk about it with a family member the other day and they just didn’t get it, they don’t understand how EDs can be toxically competitive.

It helps me soothe myself and at this point is mostly a habit I can’t stop. I’m 30. 
I can tell my body is suffering. I’m sick a lot, exhausted a lot and very likely have a vitamin or electrolyte deficiency. 

I want to get help but I don’t want to disclose to my doctor in specific terms what behaviour I’ve been engaged in. I have an appointment to see him tomorrow and I’m hoping I can get a blood test, even though I’m scared that if I do have (as I suspect) a severe electrolyte or deficiency, I’ll be interrogated and I’ll have to confess. 

On one hand, I’m scared to get found out because I feel deeply guilty and ashamed for damaging my body. That’s the central thing. I’m caught up in self-blame and I’m ashamed that I’ve been hurting myself. I know it’s a psychological problem of mental health, but I feel like I should be able to just stop and I feel guilty for not taking care of myself and of the reality that I’ve done actual irreversible damage . On the other hand, I can tell that I need medical attention and that I can’t go on like this. The childhood-esque fear of getting in trouble for doing a bad thing to my body is so strong that I have avoided getting medical help all these years. I’m scared that ultimately, shame will prevent me from getting help. I ignore my body’s symptoms often because I can’t handle the guilt and shame and I want to pretend it’s not happening. But it is 😔

The only person I have told is my previous therapist, who moved away and I can’t see anymore. Due to the shame, I could tell her that the problem existed but we never worked through it. I was too afraid and overwhelmed to actually discuss it.

I have a new therapist who I haven’t told. I’m seeing her on Thursday.  Since things are pretty bad mentally, I’m thinking of disclosing (in the same vague terms as I used with my old therapist) to her. I’m worried that telling her (or even getting blood tests done) will overwhelm me. 

Tl dr; too ashamed and guilty to let medical professionals help me. How do I overcome this? 

Any advice or thinking-through these 2 appointments and what to say and how to be nice to myself would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.",

(I have lost my period a couple more times in the past during my ED and in early recovery.)
I didn’t start this diet to lose much weight, since I’m already on a healthy weight and I haven’t weighted myself in years in order not to trigger my old ED. I only wanted to shred off some excess fat around my belly for summer.
But during this diet I have found it to be much much harder to get full after a meal and I usually eat a second plate or I come back to the kitchen for snacks very quickly.
Since I’m not getting carbs I can not measure how much I’m supposed to be eating cause it’s so different than what I’m used to. So at first I thought I wasn’t eating enough, then I started eating more and now I fear that I might adopt to a binge eating habit and I really don’t want to get another ED after five years of recovery.

So here I am sitting at plates of food I know I like and I can't tolerate it past a certain point. Things I've noted:

1. My mood can cause it to (and by it I mean the ability to just be unable to eat, trying to anyway makes me nauseous and queazy)
2. Other times my mood has no relation to it. I can be happy and unable to finish something.
3. Yes I do feel hunger. And I do eat but I will stop suddenly feeling full despite only taking one bite
4. It can happen for weeks or just once or twice a day.
5. I rarely throw up over it but it's possible if I become gluttonous and consume even when queazy kicks in.
6. I don't hate food at all. I just don't like it either unless it's what I'm craving

Now why am I not asking a doctor? They cost money. And if I want help they will consistently cost money. I can live with this. I only dip my toe in the dangerous area (occasional spells of dizziness, low energy, trouble sleeping, late periods). I'll survive and I'll either always be xxx or I'll slowly gain weight. I guess my question is how feasible is my recovery? Is it a real problem or is it as I think? Maybe I'm just a picky eater. Title: I don't know.",

Here's the backstory:

At the beginning of last year while school was still running normally, I noticed C rarely ate anything at lunch. She made excuses for why she didn’t do so and she would also be frequently looking at dieting posts and ‘healthy’ meals on instagram. Even before this began, I always noticed how she constantly looked at calories before eating anything. This behaviour worried me, but I never brought it up to her. A little while later, she confessed to me that she was throwing up everything she ate. I knew this was an eating disorder and she told me not to tell anyone, but I was very concerned and debated how I could have told her parents what was going on without revealing my identity. In the end, I didn’t end up telling them. If I could go back in time and change one thing, I’m not kidding you making that decision would be it. If I had told her parents right away I could have saved her so much pain and I feel so much regret for not doing so. Fast forward a couple months when we were talking one day and she told me that she told her dad everything that was going on, how she was throwing up her food and that now they went on grocery trips together and bought (what she perceived was) healthy foods that she would eat. I trusted she was telling the truth because she is super close to her dad. I was so happy that she had told him and I thought this would be the first steps towards her recovery. Although she should be able to eat anything without feeling guilty or feeling like she needed to throw it up, whether that be ‘healthy’ or ‘junk’ foods, not just with ‘healthy’ foods. I was just so happy that she was eating. I thought everything was going well until a few months ago when one day on our walk she told me that she wanted to start working out. I told her to take it very slow and to make sure she was fuelling herself with food and water so she could have lots of energy. She often made negative comments about herself and how she hates her body so I was a bit worried she would develop unhealthy habits but if she started slow, I thought she would be okay. In the past few months, I have noticed she has lost a significant amount of weight which is not something I would usually comment on but I think it’s important to bring up here. It has been so drastic that even my mom has asked me if she is okay. A couple months ago, she told me she hadn’t gotten her period in 5 months which I knew was a sign of under-eating and not getting enough nutrients in her body so this made me worried that she wasn’t eating at all or she was not eating enough. The last time we saw each other, she told me she still hadn’t gotten it and it had now been 7 months. That same day she told me that she works out for 2 hours which really shocked me! This is an excessive amount of time to be working out so I am really worried she is under-eating and over-exerting herself. She also said to me (something along the lines of) “If my thighs were as small as my calves everything would be fine.” I’m really worried about what kind of habits she has developed and I think they are affecting her physical health in a very negative way. 

I cannot put into words the amount of regret I feel for not having told her parents when she first told me. A couple weeks ago I wrote a letter that I was planning on emailing to her parents from a fake email address that basically mentions everything I said above. I saw her again today as she came over with her mom and sister and the entire time I was thinking about the letter and literally felt like I was going to throw up because I was so guilty and nervous and as soon as she left I went to my room and cried and was shaking (I know this sounds way overdramatic but I feel so guilty every time I think about her or talk to her or her parents).

A few days ago she also informed me that she spent 2 hours at the doctors and that she had to follow up with him. She didn't tell me much about it but when I tried asking her about it she didn't want to talk about it, so of course I didn't push. I have no idea if it has anything to do with this but I'm starting to think it might. 

Anyway, I really want to tell her parents everything I know, but I don't know how. Should I send them the email? My mom and her mom are really good friends so should I tell my mom and have her tell her mom? Or should I meet with her in person (it's probably the best way but I'm so scared she's going to hate me for not telling her earlier which is stupid cause I should be putting my friends health before my feelings). Sorry for the super long post I just really need help on what to do please I just want to do what's best for her but I'm so stressed about how to do this. I greatly appreciate anyone who is willing to give advice!",

I am very overwhelmed and want the best for my partner but his health is concerning and I feel out of my depth. 

My partner has an ED that involves both restricting/purging and recently it got so bad that his health was declining. I read up on some studies that essentially scared me, particularly with purging, and we tried to establish some healthy boundaries together that would keep him safe.

Here's where it gets messy:
His therapist had just offered him a treatment program that took months to be approved for-- by the time he was approved, he had just been hired for a new job. He couldn't do both, he'd have to quit his job to do this 2 month program. At the time he told me he was doing better with his ED and I said the decision was up to him-- if he felt he was OK then I felt that it was also important to have a stable income since he was having a hard time finding a job after the pandemic. 

Except I found out that he'd been lying to me about how bad it was and it was serious enough that we got into an argument because I'm so afraid for his health. I found out his therapist left him because he refused to take the program. If I had known how bad it was, I would have encouraged him to take the program and I'd support him financially as much as possible. I don't know what to do, because he realizes it's bad but he sounds more concerned about reaching his ""goal weight"" before going into treatment. He's upset about the idea of gaining in treatment, and I've tried to be supportive but I feel like I'm sitting by and letting his ED consume him. He said he doesn't want to be like this anymore but I sometimes feel like I'm being gaslit by his disorder when he's convincing me ""it's not that bad"" or ""I've only been restricting this much for x days"", etc.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to micromanage, I've tried to make all his triggers easier by helping plan grocery lists and getting groceries for him, making sure he always has ""safe food"" available, exercising together so he doesn't overdo it (another issue he has). I remind him all the time how much I love him and any little progress he DOES do I am quick to acknowledge and support. 

Is there anything else i can do? I'm stressed out but I fear if I don't try to help more I will be complicit in his self-harm. I've been trying to seek therapy, so I know that is one thing I can be doing for myself. Thank you all. :(",

So my mom has always been into fitness, she used to run marathons, but lately it has become a borderline obsession. She noticed around this time last year that she had put on a little bit of weight, nothing major but she decided to dive into fitness. She is a 5' 3"" 47 year old woman and she started off weighing about xxx pounds (normal weight)  and didn't like the way she looked. Now almost exactly a year later she weighs yyy pounds (much less) and she is still obsessively logging everything she eats into a calorie counter, and she works out every single day. She will get home from a 12 hour day of work and run 5 miles or do like a P90X style workout. She is also training to climb a mountain, so she will regularly walk/hike like 17 miles a day on her days off of work  and then do another actual workout later. I am starting to get kind of concerned that all of this working out combined with the eating and calorie counting might have developed into something a bit more serious, like an eating disorder but I don't really have any experience with this, and I don't wanna like approach her and seem like accusatory or make her self conscious if there's no reason to so I guess I'm asking, do you think I have reason to worry and if so how do you think I should go about addressing it? If it is serious I don't want to just pretend I don't notice, but my sister has brought it up to me too and we are both borderline concerned. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!",

this has made me so so stressed, the recent weight loss has made my hair fall more frequently and i deal with a mood instability that makes me mentally drained all the time (idk what this, if it's a mental illness or not because i've never seen a therapist) and overall it just makes everything harder, but since i've never experienced bulimia or have been diagnosed as anorexic i can't really tell if i'm being a fraud or if i should actually try to work my mental set to go get some professional help, but like i said this has been frequent since my early teen days and i learned early about some eating disorder terms and habits thanks to tumblr, but the only thing I have tried has been fasting and drinking only water for as long as i possibly can. 
would anyone maybe share the same experience as me or even help me about anything i said?? thank you!",

I later realized these are symptoms of bulimia. Earlier this year I started self-induced vomiting and that’s just made things worse. I decided to recover and so in April I stopped dieting and it was going great for 2 weeks until I took a photo w a friend on an occasion and then when I later saw it I felt like I looked fat (I probably didn’t). But that just made me go into a hate spree and I decided to diet again. And so the binge purge cycle started once again. But this is making me miserable, especially with added stress from college. I really don’t wanna be worrying about my body and food all the time. I know the right thing to do would be to stop dieting and start eating intuitively but I am so scared of gaining weight. I know I shouldn’t care about this but I do. Ever since losing weight I have been feeling a lot more confident, I can wear the clothes I want and I don’t feel as insecure.

Hi beautiful people! I'm a 21F looking for advice in a world that seems to have no answers. A little bit of background: I have struggled with disordered eating for a big chunk of my life but I have been committed to recovery for over 3 years now. I love the peace that recovery has brought, and I'm very scared of losing it. Nevertheless, I'm at my highest weight ever and while it doesn't necessarily bother me, all I can think of when I look in the mirror is of how my fat phobic friends and family perceive me. They make comments about how much better I looked before, and I feel the urge to go back to those behaviors just to be more visually pleasing. It might be all in my head, but I feel unsafe in this bigger body in some way. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Attempting ""healthy"" weight loss has never gone well for me, so intentional weightless is not an option, but I feel desperate to feel fully accepted in my community.

I went to the doctor because, to be honest, I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a long time now, and my lack of interest in eating has spiraled out of control. Don't get me wrong, as a kid, yes, I was picky, but I loved to eat. I would binge eat like crazy. All I wanted to do my whole life was gain weight. But when I was 18 I had an illness causing stomach ulcers which made it unbearable to eat. I would take a few bites and clutch my abdomen in pain. My new doctor thinks this may have caused me to develop a negative association with food in my brain which has persisted even though the pain is gone. 
Things did get a little easier in time after the ulcers went away, but when I was 21 I went through a pretty awful breakup and I've been gradually losing weight since. Now I'm 23, 5'6' and only xxx lbs (underweight bmi)  which must be my lowest weight since middle school. I basically starve myself until 4pm, then eat just enough to get myself through the night, and I despise exercise which is just sad as I've been an athlete my whole life. 
The depression and anxiety started when I was roughly 16 I'd say, but it's been the hardest in the past year or so. Last July I found myself having suicidal fantasies, so I started counseling briefly, until suddenly I felt it wasn't worth anything. Shortly after, I found myself in situations I had never been in before. I was a SB here and there and even flew to Vegas spontaneously with a girlfriend. I ran up my credit card bill, and developed intense feelings for her at the time, but felt so much shame at the end of all this that I isolated for a solid month. I keep going in and out of these cycles and patterns in my life, and I feel like I'm constantly slipping (but honestly it's like I never really came back to myself). I don't know where to begin or end with all this. There's been so much, I don't know when the unraveling started or when I started starving myself.
My doctor thinks I have an undiagnosed eating disorder, though she confirmed it isn't anything basic like anorexia or bulimia. She wants to start me on a mild dose of Paroxetine until I can get into counseling to sort all this out. I'm worried about the side effects and I'm worried about the withdrawals. I have a new guy in my life, and I don't want any loss of libido, but also, I don't want to crash into depression again when we inevitably end.
Has anybody ever tried using this drug for eating disorders, possibly to gain weight? She said it may temper my personality, which would likely help. Lift my mood. I am scared to start my dosage, but I'm also scared to not do anything.",

My doctors have always treated it as anorexia because I’m so underweight, they face me away from the scale when they measure me and don’t tell me the numbers.

I don’t THINK I have a problem with food. I never think about calories or anything. I even look forward to eating good meals.

On top of that, I am constantly nauseous when I wake up in the morning and sometimes throughout the day at any time of the month. Sometimes I throw up for no reason.

I don’t know if I subconsciously have a problem with food or my body image? Or maybe it’s just anxiety? But this problem persists regardless of my mental state. I guess it gets worse when I’m in school but it’s the summer now and I’m facing the same problem as I have been for the last 4 years. What is going on with me? Should I be asking doctors about problems with my digestive system or something? Or should I be seeing a mental health person for an eating disorder?",

I have obviously been troubled by the weight restoration aspect, but I’m even more troubled by how I’m eating these days. 

I’ve had a lot of hard days at work, and simultaneously, and on those days I’ve been finding myself practically doubling my food intake. As a result, I’ve gained a lot of weight, and I’m just really scared that all of this is potentially going to derail my recovery. A sad day like yesterday resulted in me eating fast food three times. It just doesn’t feel like a healthy relationship with food.

At the same time, my ED doctor just seems happy that I’m not underweight, and she thinks it will all equalise out soon. My therapist is also in that boat, and she specifically thinks I’m “looking for an excuse to starve myself.” She also asserts that its normal to use food as a coping mechanism (sometimes). Is she right? Am I being overly concerned, or should I actually seek help for these eating habits I’ve formed.",

&amp;#x200B;

I’m looking for some advice, potentially a few people to support each other while recovering from eating disorders. Little bit about me, I was 14 when I first began purging and since then I have had an on again off again relationship with it. My weight has ranged from underweight to overweight and currently I am still overweight. I’ve tried to seek help numerous times for recovery and support, I do have other mental health issues including autism, depression and potential borderline personality disorder. I’m currently on antidepressants and I have been for two years now; however I do not feel like I am equipped to make healthy choices with food. I feel like I either go between over eating and bingeing, sometimes purging or being far too restrictive. What I would like to do is get to a point where I’m eating to nourish my body and not just focusing every moment on what to do and what to eat next. I’m aware that my eating and what I put into my body is massively linked to my mental state. However I would love to get to the point where I am not emotionally eating all of the time. I’m in my late 20s and I would love to find a relationship and settle down in the next few years and I hate the idea that I might potentially influence my children in the future. I would love to learn how to carefully choose my food nourish myself and enjoy what I’m eating. If anyone has any helpful tips or would like to chat, I’d love that.",

Last year it was binge eating and then I was working on unrestricted eating which helped for a while, but then I started restricting again and was feeling really stuck mentally. 

So I got a therapist who, despite asking for an eating disorder specialist, is not one. The first thing she told me was to choose a goal to work on (her examples included a goal weight or BMI, I said I just wanted to feel stronger again and I don’t use a scale, but I’m having a hard time not thinking about weightloss 24/7) Her using those examples has really freaked me out and when I brought that up she said I could lose weight in a healthy way, I just don’t know how yet. She said it may be unrealistic for me to be happy at my current weight if I don’t feel good in my body, and if I lose weight it will help me feel better because I’ve accomplished a goal.

But lately I’ve been having such a hard time eating. It’s been messing with my sleep cause I get too hungry, but I don’t want to eat. I hate eating and making food, I hate even thinking about food. I want to lose weight but I’m gaining weight and feeling sick all the time because I’m too hungry. 

I just don’t know if this therapist is a good fit, I kind of feel like I need a higher level of care but I don’t know how to ask for that. I hate that I asked for ED treatment and all I got was two appointments a month with someone who doesn’t specialize in EDs. This is my first time asking for help and I don’t really know what to do. I don’t even know if she’s right and it just doesn’t make sense to me because I’ve never lost weight in a healthy way. I just feel lost.",
