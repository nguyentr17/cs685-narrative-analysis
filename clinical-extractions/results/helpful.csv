Brief background, I was diagnosed with anorexia for 4 years, then binge-eating disorder for 1 year, and began attempting recovery in 2017 while struggling with flip-flopping to both sides of the spectrum. 7 years total of major depression and other related mental health issues prior to 2017. I am currently 20 years old. 2017: 

1. How to stop binge-eating?? First focused on awareness mid-bingeing that I wanted to stop. I realized I would go mentally numb and binge-eating was a coping mechanism for my stress. I wrote myself a letter the morning after a binge, describing every detail, telling future me why it didn't help, how awful my body felt, and that I could do better for myself. I still read this from time-to-time today. Discovered I felt like I was intrinsically-worthless, but did not yet make a connection that the false belief contributed to my binges. 

2. I always had a journal my entire life and realized I only ever journaled the negative things in my life. I made my first attempts at jotting down positive things as well. 2018: First time I went to therapy. Realized anorexia &amp; binge-eating both had to do with control. I turned to not eating to feel in control when everything else was crazy, and binged when life was too painful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I realized several very important things that made this year a turning point: 

1. I allowed myself to be alone and feel pain alone. I previously used food to avoid facing my emotions. 

2. Food-focus was a coping mechanism. I brain-stormed on paper a list of 50+ other possible coping mechanisms for stress and picked a few that I loved: meditating, drinking sparkling water, reading, going for walks, taking hot showers, reaching out to a friend, working out. 

3. I learned it was important to give names to what I was avoiding: discovered that being sxually abused as a child was what triggered my initial disordered eating. I had refused to face it for years &amp; through professional help, finally began processing what happened to me, instead of avoiding it with food control or binges. I identified my disorder as something inside of me, not actually \~me\~. 

4. Facing a very invasive surgery (unrelated to my ed) I discovered the power of meditation with self-awareness and anxiety. The best way for me was to visualize that I was a tree &amp; my thoughts were the birds around it. I am not my thoughts. I am a being. First discovered the experience of being fully present, with short 5-minute meditations where I just allowed myself to be aware of all my thoughts, sitting cross-legged in a quiet room on the floor with my eyes closed. 

2019: Had a few relapses from challenging life events, but learned a lot. 

1. First learned how to forgive myself even if others were still hurting. 

2. Learned about boundaries in therapy. I either had stringent boundaries or very weak boundaries and almost nothing in-between. 

3. Began learning how to be more open about my issues &amp; chose people to confide in \*VERY critical to the next steps of healing in the next 2 years, although it seemed unrelated. This was the year I began to build my ""support group"". I had no one to confide in previously. 10/10 highly recommend first focus on finding 1 person you can trust with your journey. 

4. Learned about Guilt vs. Shame: my therapist recommended TED Talk ""Listening to Shame"" by Brene Brown on YouTube, it CHANGED my life. I realized I struggled with shame, not guilt, &amp; began to make distinctions between the two &amp; reframe how I felt about myself. 

2020: Huge accomplishment: Achieved my first 6 months at a healthy weight that I felt beautiful at, w/o fluctuating up &amp; down significantly! Really began developing a sense of when it's ok to eat &amp; when to stop. Had 1 more major relapse. 

1. I read the book ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"": just the 1st 2 chapters was enough to realize how deeply embedded our childhood is in all of us. HIGHLY recommend. Gave me further power over my deep pain &amp; ability to separate desire to eat/avoid eating with desire to not feel pain. Realized I could be in control if I wanted. 

2. Did a 30-day challenge called ""Beating Binge Eating"": learned a TON, highly recommend. For me specifically, learned I had a lot of bad habits with control. I not only controlled food, but tried to control everything else too. I attempted a more holistic approach, identified things (like my family) that I gave too much power to, &amp; began to focus more on me through ""self-care"". -Important Take-aways from this challenge: Even tho my over-eating was not as calorically large as it used to be, it was still compulsive and therefore a binge. I now label any compulsive eating as a binge, because naming it gives me power over it. I would often spend 20 minutes in Walmart picking the perfect calorie/flavor/type of ice cream &amp; realized I did this with a lot of foods, and ordering in restaurants. I gave myself a time limit to decide on food--because, after all, it's just food. Also made 2 new rules on my weekly food-shopping: (1) if I saw a food I liked 2 weeks in a row &amp; still wanted it, then I got it the 3rd time I saw it. (2) every week I bought myself at least 1 treat, no matter what. This allowed me to discover I could in fact have treats &amp; not binge on it, because I knew I would be getting more the next week no matter what, &amp; helped heal some scarcity mindset. 

3. Self-Care: Watched ""AlexandrasGirlyTalk"" Youtube video on How To Self Care. Applied it to my life: scheduled in showers, researched best soaps/makeup/ways to make myself feel good in ways other than food to decrease my stress. For the first time ever, dedicated a couple hours a week to relaxing, even if it felt selfish or like I should be doing other more ""important"" busy-work. Really learned how to connect with myself &amp; truly feel, cry, &amp; not be numb. 

. Attended EMDR therapy for my trauma&amp; began learning how to re-file everything. HIGHLY recommend therapy in general. By FAR the biggest contributor to my healing. I saw 5 total therapists in 2 years ranging from eating disorders, general therapy, and EMDR. It's OK if it takes a couple tries before you find one that you work well with. 

2021: I moved 1300 miles away from my hometown &amp; got a new clarity on what I want in life. 

1. I read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving A Fck"": Realized I cared too much about what my family/everyone thought of me. Fully accepted it’s OK to take a break from communication with toxic people &amp; am currently still on that break to connect with what I want. I had also assumed being a certain weight added value to my life. I was wrong. 

2. I read the reddit post ""How I Quit Binge Eating - A Guide For Those Who Struggle"": The phrase ""Bruh, it's just food"" stuck out to me. I’m learning to identify that the only thing a binge/over-eating does is satisfy the urge to binge. I gave it too much control/importance because of how I initially abused it as a child for a false sense of control. I will literally chant ""Bruh, it's just food"" in my head when I feel compulsive, &amp; most times I say it until my heartrate slows down, I believe it, &amp; I can simply move on with my day. Sometimes I fail (aka obsess over food for way longer than I like) &amp; that's OK too. 

3. Discovered I needed to Fail: one day I walked to the gym, stayed for 1 minute, &amp; walked back--shocked when I was in tears with sudden urges to binge &amp; couldn't get it together for a while. My whole life I told myself I can ""fail"" but never believed it &amp; always punished myself after without being aware of it. New way of thinking I am attempting now: If I don't want to do something, I will attempt it for 5 minutes and then stop if I still don't want to. Then actually allow myself to stop after 5 minutes without creating any consequences for myself. Still learning how to do this, but it’s incredibly freeing &amp; allows me to enjoy a large meal and move on with my amazing day. Or take a day off from a heavy lifting routine in the gym &amp; play videogames instead w/o beating myself up for being ""lazy"". 

4. New eating goal: I eat until my hunger signals go away, not eat until I am completely full for hours. Still learning to do this, but it leaves me free to eat enjoyable food when I want &amp; look forward to more later. 

5. Discovered I still struggled with feeling intrinsically worthless. To combat this, I began to put my worth in a higher power, Jesus. Yes this is specific to my religion, but my whole life I tried to get my worth from what I do for other people, &amp; how they perceive me. I realized this will always be lacking &amp; needed to choose something somewhat arbitrary for my mind to latch onto, something that will never change, so even if the people around me are not treating me well, I know I don’t need their validation to be allowed to live a full life. This has helped me ease desires of food coping mechanisms, &amp; instead believe I am not intrinsically dirty just by the fact that I exist &amp; am already loved by someone/something beyond us. 

I'd love to hear what others have used for combatting feelings like this too! I’ve tried everything I can think of, but this is the only thing that has truly impacted my life at its worst. Overall, I realized my eating disorders had almost nothing to do with food. It was the most convenient coping mechanism at the time, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong or dirty about me because I still obsessively think about food sometimes. There is SO much more to life than food. My journey needed a much more holistic approach than just focusing on food... so hope this helps someone else too. If you're at this point or beyond, what have you learned? How do you lose the desire to eat once you are full/move on with your day? Do you obsess sometimes still, or eventually it went away for you completely? Did you ever see a correlation between self-worth/food-focus &amp; what were your discoveries?",

binged yesterday, but today I bounced back. Hello [r/BingeEatingDisorder](https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder), this is the first time I wirte here. I am 18M and normal weight right now I am not very active due to an overtraining injury that didn't heal properly (another binging problem I had, but that's another story). I don't have a binge eating disorder to the extent that some poeple on this sub have, but I do have my fair share of struggles with food, hunger and satiety, and to a lesser extent body Image. It is 10pm as I'm writing this post, and I feel like I wanted to share this story.

me, my mother (who BTW lost a lot of weight in 2018-2019) and her husband (not my dad, my mom is a single mother) are right now at a hotel. the hotel has breakfast and dinner. on thursday my family went to a restaurant, and I ate a pretty hefty meal around 5pm. then there was dinner and I was not hungry, so I ate a small dinner bc I know that if I don't eat something in the evening, I can't fall asleep (yes, it sucks). It was around xxx calories. friday morning (yesterday) I ate for breakfast a huge meal, and for dinner, It was a motherfucking feast. *meal details deleted*. I was absolutely conscious about that (although not completely under my control), and it was planned ahead (I told myself ""fuck it, I'll just eat undtil I'm stuffed because this is food that Isn't readily available at home usually"") after the meal I was stuffed as hell, and had a few mini-pukes. I told myself, while looking in the mirror and having my camera on ""I am worried for you [u/nothereforupvotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/nothereforupvotes), I don't want you to develop and eating pattern like this, of eating until you are stuffed and gaining fat. tomorrow you will eat 2 slices of bread, a small container of cottage cheese, an egg, and a lot of veggies, maybe a small savory pastry (kid of a trigger but I ate only a small one). understood?"" I didn't beat myself up as much (and when I did, I said ""this is an alarm going off, that something isn't right. I can do this without beating myself up"") which is an achievement bc I used to beat myself up after occasions like that"". "" then went outside for a little bit, wrote down my thoughts and feelings about this event and other events throughout the day, and then got into a convo with a friendly couple that also slept in the hotel. woke up at around 9am today (saturday), went to breakfast with my mom and kept that promise.was full, but not stuffed. then around 2pm there was lunch and I slightly overate (more than I planned) but not to the extent of what happened on friday It was much better. an hour ago I ate a large salad and a small bowl of mac&amp;cheese. I was proud of myself for bouncing back and not going to the other extreme like I see other people do on this sub. I am really happy for myself for not purging/starving like othe people would do, and wanted to share some tips that when I do have a successful time managing my eating.

find passions unrelated to food, or at least not eating it. music (huge one for me), hobbies, skills, shows on TV.

hard AF, but try to be compassionate with yourself. Instead as labeling yourself as a ""pig"" or a ""fatso)"" but telling yourself ""I have a problem, and it sucks. I want to have better habits and be able to control myself.

prepare your meals ahead of time, and eat low calorie dense foods that taste average to good, so they won't be extremely disgusting to the point of not being able to stick long term, but not extremely delicious so you'll be able to stop.

find an accountability partner with the same interest (for me it's my mom who tries to maintain a healthy weight and has a history with being overweight)

try and understand the root of your binges. maybe it's lack of other interests other than food, boredom, FOMO (a huge reason for me) trauma, mental health disorders, etc. I don't want to be a holier-than-thou, rather give people hope, BC this sub is at times very pessimistic.

tl;dr- went to a hotel, gorged insane amounts of food in the span of 30 hrs, but held myself accountable and bounced back with a healthy and relatively small breakfast, avoiding compensatory behavior.

good week everyone, peace&amp;love.",

How can I keep up with what's going on with her without making it feel like I'm invading her privacy constantly? Are there any podcasts/reading/any other information for not only her, but her mom and I, too? I have already started listening to Food Psych, which has a lot of useful information. Thank you.",
