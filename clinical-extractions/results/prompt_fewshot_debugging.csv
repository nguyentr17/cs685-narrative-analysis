1,EatingDisorders,"I 26 f told the truth for the first time about my eating disorder to my boyfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years now. I've been bulimic since I was a child. The first time i purge was around when i was 12. I've been dealing with this alone my whole life. You know how it is, my ed consume my life in so many ways. Lately it's been particularly difficult, I don't have a nice life for many reasons that I'm not gonna explain here, because even though this is anonymous I'm not ready to talk about it. 
I find extremely difficult to talk about my problems, I usually bottles up everything. 
I didn't eat for the last 3 days. I've quit smoking 2.5 years ago and today smoked 6 cigarettes. Half an hour ago I was with my boyfriend and, I don't know fucking why I told him everything. I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me.

5,EatingDisorders,"So i (f21) had an ed for 3 years (anorexia and bulimia) and been recovering for 4. In my class, there is this girl who is clearly very anorexic. I can see all of her behaviours (not ever sitting down, perfectionism, never eating lunch or anything, exercising VERY excessively for multiple hours every single day, being very underweight, bragging about only eating vegetables, being clearly very insecure but needing a lot of attention, hair loss, brittle finger nails.... the list goes on). She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled. At that moment i felt a panic attack setting in. I recovered all on my own and told almost no one, and every time i talk about it, i get anxiety and panic attacks.

13,EatingDisorders,"Today my sister and I got into an argument of sorts. She said she was having a bad day. When I asked her why, she told me to just be grateful I “don’t have any problems”. 

I knew she was referring to her eating problems. She told me before how she gets annoyed when her friends complain about their problems because at least they “don’t go hungry every day”. She says that everyone else’s issues are “external” and fixable (e.g. having an exam to sit: the problem is over once the exam finishes) whereas her ED is “internal” - it’s part of her that she can never change, that affects her constantly.

I was initially annoyed that she assumed I didn’t have problems. I do. I just choose not to share them with anyone. I struggle with gender dysphoria, which I would consider to be “internal”, like hers. But I didn’t feel like coming out to her just to prove a point.

Anyways, I ask her the question “So, if you were born on a desert island with no people to interact with, no society, but all the resources you would need to survive, would you have these eating problems?”

I wanted to prove a point to her. The point being: your problems aren’t actually internal - they are a consequence of society. I posed this question partly to prove my sister wrong and partly because I care about her and want her to think critically about why she has her ED.

She mumbled a response, her eyes not meeting mine. “Sorry?” I said. I looked over at her and realised that her voice was choked with tears as she said “No”.

We were on a walk to the shops together and she cried quietly the way there. I felt like I had struck something important inside of her, some sort of realisation. But I also felt terribly guilty for upsetting her. I apologised when we reached the shops and she said “It’s not your fault.”

I want to encourage my sister to talk to me about how she feels about food, and she likes to occasionally. I’ve always felt like talking it through rationally might help. Today was a mess though. I was on edge the rest of the day, not wanting to make her cry again.

I want to help her. It feels like the only way I can is to reach her through words. But I don’t have an ED myself, and I fear I’m doing it all wrong.

15,EatingDisorders,"Okay so after a long time of just eating whatever I want I decided to restrict again. So today I decided to fast until dinner time. I was really hungry but I distracted myself by watching a show and sleeping. Then I ate some spicy chicken and rice around 9 pm. Everything was fine until I actually shat myself 💀💀💀💀

I ran to the toilet and cleaned myself up and decided to take a shower cos I was so disgusted by myself. Then my stomach started ACHINGGGG. I have been shitting non stop since then fuck. 

I don't care tho, gonna keep eating only dinner for 2 weeks atleast then I'll fast for 2 days at a time or something.

16,EatingDisorders,As a young male teenager I think I had a ED but I’m not entirely sure. I used to skip lunch frequently at school so I would have breakfast at 7am and then not eat anything till like 5pm. I did this on and off for about 8 years. I’m not sure why I did it but it would get to the point where I would feel faint annoyed and exhausted pretty much everyday. I’m not sure if it was an ED as it doesn’t match any of the descriptions. I also did this unconsciously and didn’t see anything wrong with it at the time but now when I look back I think why? I’m sure I have ruined my body due to 8 years of harm. I have gotten better though nowadays I don’t skip lunch but I just have fruit and like a yoghurt drink which is a massive improvement and I do this every working day.,,Previous ED or ED behaviours,1,,,,,,t5_2qpcj,10oczrv,1,ObsessedWithMagic,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10oczrv/previous_ed_or_ed_behaviours/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10oczrv/previous_ed_or_ed_behaviours/,1675013005,159,0,0,0,-1,1,Skipping lunch frequently for 8 years,harmful,"['Feeling faint, annoyed, and exhausted everyday', 'Unconscious behavior and not seeing anything wrong with it at the time']",Skipping lunch frequently for 8 years,unknown,"['Feeling faint, annoyed, and exhausted everyday', 'Unsure if it was an eating disorder, but acknowledges the harm it may have caused to the body']","Skipping lunch frequently for 8 years, unconscious behavior",unknown,"['Feeling faint, annoyed, and exhausted on a daily basis', 'Unclear whether this behavior matches criteria for an eating disorder']"
17,EatingDisorders,"I’m recovering from BED and haven’t binged in probably six months. I’m proud of the progress I have made, but I’m still going through some mental anguish. This is mainly in regards to socially eating. So I have a group of friends that are foodies and basically want to go out to eat a lot. I love hanging out with them, but every time I hang out with them, the event revolves around food or going to a restaurant. Every time I go and eat with them, I feel immense guilt and self-hatred afterwards. Even if the food is super good, I still hate myself afterwards. My closest friend in that group has reassured me that it will be okay if I have a day where I eat good food. She has even said that life is too short for bad food. I want to feel empowered by that, but I just can’t. When I eat food at a restaurant, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m wrong and disgusting. I feel like I’m going to go back to my old ways and I’m just super negative in my head after I go out to eat with them. Also I feel like if I go and say no to food, people are going to ask me why and I just don’t feel like telling them a whole story. I love hanging out with them, but I don’t know what to do to resolve my bad emotions.",,How do I become comfortable with socially eating?,1,one,question,,,,t5_2qpcj,10ocf8i,1,throwawaytransssssss,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10ocf8i/how_do_i_become_comfortable_with_socially_eating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10ocf8i/how_do_i_become_comfortable_with_socially_eating/,1675011638,246,0,0,1,-1,1,Social pressure to eat in group settings,harmful,"['Experiencing guilt and self-hatred after eating with foodie friends', 'Feeling like going back to old ways and being negative towards self', 'Concerns about being questioned if not eating', ""Struggling with feeling empowered by friend's reassurance""]",Social pressure to eat out frequently with foodie friends,harmful,"['Experiencing immense guilt and self-hatred after eating out with friends, even if the food is good', 'Feeling like going back to old ways and being negative in their head after eating out', 'Fear of judgement or questions from friends if saying no to food']",Social pressure to eat in group of foodie friends,harmful,"['Experiencing immense guilt and self-hatred after eating with friends, even if the food is good', 'Feeling negative and fearful of relapse after going out to eat with friends']"

Hi, I’m in my early 30s and I struggle with anorexia. I am underweight (borderline) and I am worried about fainting or having an episode that I end up in the hospital for. My husband has been begging me to get labs done but I am not ready for recovery again. Last time I felt like a cow being funneled oatmeal and it makes me nauseous and anxious just thinking about again. My question is, if something ever were to happen where I were to end up at a hospital, could they force me to recover? Admit me and force me to stabilize or tube me? Or is that just a thing for minors. Or do they just say “yep you’re sick, follow up on the outside goodbye” or do they keep you?
