I find extremely difficult to talk about my problems, I usually bottles up everything. 
I didn't eat for the last 3 days. I've quit smoking 2.5 years ago and today smoked 6 cigarettes. Half an hour ago I was with my boyfriend and, I don't know fucking why I told him everything. I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me.

10,1.0,EatingDisorders,"So i (f21) had an ed for 3 years (anorexia and bulimia) and been recovering for 4. In my class, there is this girl who is clearly very anorexic. I can see all of her behaviours (not ever sitting down, perfectionism, never eating lunch or anything, exercising VERY excessively for multiple hours every single day, being very underweight, bragging about only eating vegetables, being clearly very insecure but needing a lot of attention, hair loss, brittle finger nails.... the list goes on). She does all of those things VERY obviously and sometimes comments on them (starts listing all of her workouts loudly, or speaks about how 'nobody likes her anyways') and shes literally screaming for attention.

Its triggering me, but at the same time i want to help and dont know how, and its clearly none of my business though. Today i talked to another girl about my ed past, and she said she had an ed too and we spoke about losing our periods. The anorexic girl sometimes just threw words into our conversations (she was working next to us while we talked), and all of a sudden she said ""i havent had mine in 6 years"" and smiled. At that moment i felt a panic attack setting in. I recovered all on my own and told almost no one, and every time i talk about it, i get anxiety and panic attacks. Could this be because i am triggered, or because it holds a lot of trauma that needs to be processed? If so, how? Does crying about it make it better or does it Trigger my ed thoughts and depression?

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you. I don't like the idea of veganism or cannibalism. Diets can and should be balanced.",,28- orthorexia self diagnosed. i think i have gotten better. i got it when i was 15 and started with cutting soda plus fast food out. no candy bars or junk food aside from maybe nature valley bars.,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10o1fpx,1,Embarrassed_Cup2524,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10o1fpx/28_orthorexia_self_diagnosed_i_think_i_have/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10o1fpx/28_orthorexia_self_diagnosed_i_think_i_have/,1674975467,329,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,no,writer,,,,,,no,writer,,,,,,no,writer,,

I tried to recover and then relapsed again. I started to recover again at the start of December and it‚Äôs going really well. Especially in the last week. I went from a full meal a day to Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and snacks. I have so much more energy and all my headaches are gone.

My dad, who often has ideas about how to improve my mental and physical health,(even though his abuse is the reason I have both), will not stop sending me studies about eating a ""healthier"" diet. I am weight restored, too weight restored for him (he also has an eating disorder), so no one suspects I'm relapsed. I don't think he would believe me even if I told him.

84,1.0,EatingDisorders,"Hey everyone, over the last 3 years I have struggled pretty heavily with food. I'm gonna summarize what's happened so far, and will put my question after this paragraph if you want to skip.

I used to be very very obese, and I decided to start slowly eating better. I also started fasting. A few months into this, I went to the doctor, and got some scary blood work. An almost too high a1c. My lab numbers have always been bad, but the a1c sent me into a health anxiety tailspin. I kept cutting stuff out and eating less and less. I also slowly took on a keto diet. I also started regularly working out. I started to test my blood sugars all the time. I would even challenge myself by drinking a bunch of sugar water and testing every 15 minutes for 3 hours. My numbers were always normal. My fingers would be bruised all the time. Then, I started having some bad body symptoms. Basically a tremor. I freaked out and went to the doctor. Got a bunch of blood tests that showed malnutrition. I was asked about my caloric intake, and after thinking for a while I realized I was eating basically nothing. I started to bulk up my meals with low carb stuff: cheese, veggies, nuts, meat, and felt a lot better. Still tested my sugars whenever I ate carbs. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm close to a healthy weight now, all my numbers are pretty great, except my cholesterol is a touch high, but not as high as it was when I was heavy.

Well, now I'm concerned about my low carb diet, and I want to move toward a more balanced, healthy one. I'm terrified, because carbs equal blood sugar testing for me, but I'm trying to take it one step at a time. My concern is, could this just be an evolution of my disordered eating? Being so concerned with healthy foods that it's just bringing me out of a low carb diet and into a Mediterranean one? I'm so exhausted. This takes up most of my thoughts every day.
