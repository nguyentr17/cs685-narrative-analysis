This morning I woke up after sleeping a solid 3 hours (typical for me) drenched in sweat and shaking. I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get out of bed or stand for more than a few seconds without feeling extremely, uncomfortably hot and feeling my vision start to go dark. My body temp was ranging from 94.8-96. My partner was worried about sepsis (I had all the symptoms but no pain). He urged me to call the doctor but I was having a hard time putting sentences together. This went on for hours. It was terrifying. 
 
 This is going to sound so fucking asinine, but I was starving, so I forced myself to eat something. Within maybe 20 minutes, I felt like 75% better. Then I started craving sugar. Like, BADLY.

  I lost my appetite or well I was just way to lazy to put any energy into eating. Tbh I didn't even realize how little I was eating because for the first time in a while I wasn't tracking anything. I just felt way to damn tired and cyncial to do it. I had a nothing matters mindset and just wallowed, sometimes I ate a little of dinner, but after realizing how much I was eating (and how much less it is than I usually eat) I've stopped eating entirely and decided to just take advantage of it instead.
 
 I couldn't use to go days without eating cause I usually binge when I heavily restrict or try fasting, but weirdly enough I haven't ate anything for maybe a few days now. I have not been keeping track.
 
 I feel like shit and probably look like it, but I also feel happy cause it feels like I have a lot of control and it's the one thing I'm doing right. Basically, it's a good distraction and I'm leaning into it. It's either this or sh and I can't do that.

 For the record, I am not anti-fitness. I *enjoy* exersize, but much of this is next level. 
 
 For someone to take up yoga while stable in recovery is OK. To go on outdoor walks, healthy and good for the brain. An old, pre-ED hobby that's physically and not too hard on a healing body, nothing wrong with it. I think exersize can be a great tool for those with emotional dysregulation disorders too, but there is a VERY CLEAR LINE. 
 
 These I influencers who are visibly body checking, yo-yo dieting, posting WIEIAD every damn day. The people who go on insane runs, powerlift, and feel the need to add protein to *everything*? It's only another level of denial. 
 
 Some of these people claim to be fully recovered. And maybe they are, but that does NOT make it OK to advertise and promote these lifestyles to ACTIVELY DISORDERED PEOPLE! Saying you're ""pro-recovery"" and then promoting your low-fat, no-carb diet and rigorous training to the very same people is in ALL LEVELS hypocritical. 
 
 ""Accept your body!"" You mean the one you are constantly changing? 
 
 ""Food is more the fuel"" Yet, you still calorie count to the very last point.

102lapp,"So over the weekend I saw a post on here talking about the ketogenic diet and expressing frustration with people trying to push keto onto people.
 
 And I do get being annoyed and upset at people who are on keto trying to push keto onto everyone they come across. Especially as people who are trying to recover from harm done by restrictive eating behavior.
 
 I admit I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m guilty of this myself, especially because keto has helped me reverse my BED which is caused by insulin resistance by overconsumption of carbs, in relation to the metabolic disease I have, PCOS. So I do tend to recommend it to people who have the same issue. 
 
 But some of the comments I saw on that post were just plain mean and nasty for no reason.
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fair to be made fun of or called ‚Äö√Ñ√∫orthorexic‚Äö√Ñ√π for how I have to treat this disease. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fair that ED recovery only centers eating without any sort of calculation or restriction when it may be necessary for those of us trying to recover from BED.
 
 Someone on another post mentioned that there seems to be a hierarchy of ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s within recovery communities and it seems like BED recovery is at the bottom of the totem pole, simply because BED recovery doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t always look like recovery from other ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s. 
 
 For one it should be common sense that treatment for restrictive ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s such as &gt;!ana/bulimia!&lt; is going to be different from recovery for excessive consumption disorders (aka BED)
 as they are both on the opposite side of the behavioral spectrum. So this idea that the only type of valid ED recovery is recovery that centers moving away from &gt;!restriction!&lt; is a very narrow minded and myopic viewpoint of recovery, that only seems to center restrictive ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s, with no room for analyzing recovery from BED.
 
 I get that there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a smaller portion of us who suffer from BED than there are ppl who suffer from ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s that cause &gt;!restriction!&lt;, but we still matter. And our recovery shouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be painted with the same brush as recovery from restrictive ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s. 
 
 It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s already bad enough that there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s such little support for recovering from BED, but to see folks looking down upon and labeling those of us who have to use very different methods for recovery is hurtful.
 
 If you read most peer reviewed studies and medical guidance for treating both BED caused by insulin resistance in relation to PCOS and other symptoms of PCOS, you will see overwhelming support of centering certain foods and &gt;!eliminating/restricting!&lt; other foods. And no, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not the result of wanton diet culture infiltrating medical treatment.
 We have legitimate proof that the &gt;!restriction!&lt; of certain foods when you have this disease makes dealing with the BED and other symptoms caused by this disease easier to deal with
 
 
 So automatically declaring all of us who have used keto/monitoring our carbohydrate intake and yes, &gt;!RESTRICTION!&lt; (dun dun dun) of certain foods to help treat our binging and other symptoms caused by this disease as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫orthorexic‚Äö√Ñ√π and calling what we eat nasty and chiding us for not being able to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫eat normally‚Äö√Ñ√π and ‚Äö√Ñ√∫care free‚Äö√Ñ√π is mean at best, and dare I say ableist at worst. Some of us really don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have a choice. 
 
 
 I understand that the concept of using restriction to treat an ED sounds oxymoronic or dangerous to most ‚Äö√Ñ√∫normal‚Äö√Ñ√π/able bodied people who suffer from ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s that cause restriction, but this is how disability works sometimes. ED recovery for most able bodied people usuallt centers moving away from restriction and towards eating whatever and not being afraid of any type of food. 
 
 My ED recovery as a disabled person with a metabolic disorder that leads to binging includes &gt;!restriction!&lt; of foods that make my binging and other symptoms of the disease I have worse. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s as simple as that.
 
 That doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t make me a freak or orthorexic, and it doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t warrant me or any others who are in the same boat as me being put down or made fun of for not being able to eat without &gt;!restriction!&lt;
 
 Please don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t take this post as the promotion of keto or any other form of restriction. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not my goal here. I should be allowed to detail how it as helped me fond relief from my BED without it being interpreted as promoting the diet.
 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m really sorry but there has to be some balance‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no need to shame or label those of us who have used diet change to help with our ED‚Äö√Ñ√¥s, the same way there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s no need for those of us who have made changes to our diet to shame other people who don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t wish to make the same changes, and find those changes hindering to their recovery. 
 
 Let‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all be kinder to each other please. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m sorry if this wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t appropriate to post on here but I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know where else to say it. If this is a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bad‚Äö√Ñ√π post I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll take it down.

102k8nd,"I was wondering if anyone else struggles with stealing food from other people and shoplifting food from supermarkets? 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m 19 and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had an ED for 7 years. It began with anorexia the bulimia then binge eating but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been attempting to be recovery focused for 3/4 years now, but still struggle with stealing food.
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been stealing food from whoever I live with, wether that be flatmates or family. It began as a binging thing but I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t binge anymore so It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s pretty much a compulsion at this point. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not strapped for cash and I CAN afford to buy myself food so it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not a money thing. I often find myself stressed out and wasting loads of money trying to replace my flatmates food in a rush before they notice. 
 
 I also steal food from supermarkets, but I do this less out of compulsion and more out of greed I think. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s usually protein bars and expensive things I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to spend money on. When I do a weekly food shop I always feel like I have to shoplift the expensive things because I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t justify spending more than ¬¨¬£X amount on groceries for the week for myself, even though I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not tight for money. I feel like I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t justify spending money on food as it makes me feel ‚Äö√Ñ√∫greedy‚Äö√Ñ√π (??) but on the other hand I feel like I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m being greedy and selfish by stealing the food. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been caught once stealing protein powder at whole foods and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to risk being caught again. 
 
 Stealing from my flatmates has caused them to get very suspicious and hostile at each other (I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think they suspect it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s me) but I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t help but feel that they will find out eventually if I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t manage my habit and stop now.

10083xu,"Last night I got into a pretty horrible fight with my partner because he was drunk (more accurately he was fighting ‚Äö√Ñ√∫at‚Äö√Ñ√π me, which used to be a very common occurrence unfortunately). He‚Äö√Ñ√¥s struggled with alcoholism for many years, but last night was the first time in a long time that he relapsed. I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t go into the details (he wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t psychically or sexually abusive), but it was extremely scary and difficult for me emotionally. He has quit drinking once again (as of today), but my anxiety is through the fucking roof. 
 
 I have been trying to attempt quasi-recovery for the last few weeks, and although I intended to eat dinner last night, I did not because I was so scared and distraught by my partner‚Äö√Ñ√¥s behavior. I actually had to call out of work today, which I NEVER do, because my anxiety has been so bad. He‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been sick all day throwing up from the alcohol, and once his stomach settled he told me that he was going to maybe order a pizza (we have basically no food in the house and I have exhausted all of my safe foods, which he wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat anyway). I told myself that I should try to eat a slice of pizza, but he ended up ordering something he knew I really didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like and now he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just eating like a fucking king while I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m angry, anxious and starving and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m pissed at him for yet another reason.

 I started recovery a month ago. It's been great! I've eaten a lot, maybe even a little bit too much, but after two months of severe undereating (according to my doctor), I don't think a few days of eating too much matter. My body says otherwise though.
 
 Since starting recovery, I've gained &gt;!6 kg!&lt; of weight. I think it's the fact that my body hasn't adapted yet, but I'm not sure. Before recovery, I was eating &gt;!&lt;1000 cals!&lt; a day and still gained (yes, it's real, it happened, it wasn't a thyroid problem or anything), is this caused by that? I gained about a kilo each week back then. Is my body still insisting that my maintenance is... nothing? That I should eat nothing or I'll gain? 
 
 Is there any way to fix this? I've gained so much weight and I've become aware of all my fat rolls touching and all that again, which is one of the main reasons my ED started. I don't want to gain more, I've already gained &gt;!7 kg!&lt;, the reason why I said &gt;!6!&lt; was because I think the last one is water weight but then again, the rest were supposed to be water weight as well but they still haven't gone away!

 (Long Rant)
 
 My depression worsened few months ago and led to full onset of restrictive AAN. I made sure I hide all my pain well because I know people around me don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really get mental illness. But with restricting, I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really hide how my body shape changed drastically in only four or five months.
 
 I have been on family vacation for the past week, and I received many probing questions or comments about my eating behavior and my weight, though no one knows about my mental health conditions. I stayed composed dealing with those, until one particular comment. We got to a new hotel and my mom found out the room has a scale. She was curious about my weight so she pushed me to weigh myself. Even with me trying to intake more during family meals, the nature of busy vacation causes a significant drop in weight. My mom got very excited and shared the news with her husband. Her ruthless/cold/cruel/full of sh*t (excuse my language) husband replied with: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫She probably throws up whenever she goes to the toilet and becoming an anorexic.‚Äö√Ñ√π
 
 I just can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t control myself after that. I went into a full breakdown crisis mode. It took me lots of effort to reach out for help, trying to do damage control before potentially developing behaviors other than pure restriction. I have also been battling with suicidal ideation: trying to stay alive has been a really hard task. And ironically, I was trying to stay alive because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want my family to be impacted for rest of their lives. On top of dealing with these chaos alone, being randomly accused and targeted is not helping. I just feel so helpless. I hate when people are so ignorant and mean. I never shared my illness with my family because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want them to worry, and I know they won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand. The only thing I have hoped is that they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t make things worse. I never even asked any support or comfort from them. But I guess with all the hiding I still cannot prevent myself from being hurt by the supposedly closest people to me. And I still have few days of vacation left with my family. With me acting out, I got the silent treatment from them, so the next few days are going to be interesting‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂.

Anyway, lately I have reached a LW since my latest relapse. Idk if I had the corner ever before, I never focussed on it. And now I can feel it being sharp and pointy, and I can see that it's so close to becoming really visible. I'm so excited about it. Side note: I'm trying to weigh myself less regular because it just drives me nuts.
 
 So, my dream was that I had in fact lost all the weight until said bmi. And I hadn't realised because I didn't weigh myself in so long. But suddenly I had this realisation that my whole body was different, and that I had these corners. And I felt so glad. Achievement unlocked. Mission completed.

108xqeq,"I (27f) have been married to my partner for a few months. We've known each other for 9 years, and have now been married a few months. There's a whole fucking ton to the story between meeting and here, but he is the best relationship I've ever had. He makes me feel loved, cared for, and beautiful. Sure there are rocky moments, but everyday I look forward to seeing him. To every moment spent together even if it's spent in silence, or even in times of relationship difficulties. I never even believed that a love like this could even be real. 
 
 Recently I have been really trying to push past the stagnant ""quasi-recovery"" I've been in for ages because I want the best for our future. I actually care about the future now. It's wild. 
 I have now hit a goal of being around X lbs after a long time of trying to get here. It's still underweight, but significantly closer to a ""healthy"" weight than I have generally been. I have only managed to hit this weight once since I was 16, and that was only maintained for about a month after 5ish months of IP/RTC. 
 Basically, I almost feel like I'm going through puberty again. It's hard to make sense of the changes in my body, but I am doing my best to push through. 
 
 My husband has praised me for my efforts, which I do appreciate. However, he also makes comments about my body changes/weight gain/etc. I have asked him to be extremely cautious, especially right now (I feel so fragile in trying to stay this course), in commenting on my body. Specifically I've asked him to refrain from commenting on weight gain, being heavier, whatever. For the most part, he's done quite well. And I appreciate that so much. 
 
 Yet when he's tired or had a bit to drink, sometimes he' l go off about my body. And in his mind, it's positive. And I know I should view it as positive, too. But he'll grab my ribs, or my hip bones, or whatever and comment on the changes. And I know he's trying to tell me how beautiful he thinks I am and how proud he is of my progress. But all my brain does is screech. 
 
 I'm not mad or upset with him in any way. Mainly this is just a vent, though if anyone does have advice, I wouldn't mind. I am really so deeply in love with and grateful for my husband.

I've had my thyroid checked and it is very slightly low but they only tested one marker (my mum takes medication for her low thyroid stuff). I can't believe I let myself get like this. I can't look in the mirror or have sex with my boyfriend. Literally half of my clothes do not fit. 
 
 I've found it hard to exercise because I'm very aware of the weight and size of my stomach. My favourite is the rowing machine but it's upsetting me to go on it because I feel so lumbering and heavy and huge. When I walk around, I feel weighed-down by my stomach. I also like rock climbing but right now, do not feel safe because of my weight. I hate my body too much to go swimming too. I prefer things which are easier on my joints. 
 
 (I know weight loss happens in the kitchen. For me, it only seems to happen when I undereat drastically, to the point of passing out).
 
 Does anyone have any ideas of what exercises I can do to get stronger? I have hypermobile joints and so I need to be careful with weight lifting. 
 
 Thank you xx
 
 P.S. I have set myself a goal to lose 5lb a month. That should mean by August I am 150lb, which is my goal weight for a big holiday I am going on. 
 
 P.P.S I am on quetiapine and it's also the day before my period. I don't usually hate myself QUITE this much.","weight fluctuation over the past years. , hyperawareness of weight and size of stomach",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"internal, internal",0,,,,0,,,,0,,,,0,,,,0

zofdk4,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been in recovery almost 2 years. I gained a lot of weight in recovery. And I shaved my head bald in august (now it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s pixie cut length). I hardly resemble my old photos on social media. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve deactivated my Facebook and archived all photos on Instagram except my profile photo and a single picture from early recovery. I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t look much different in that one picture and I only left it up so people who haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seen me all this time recognize my profile. 
 
 I basically didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want people to compare how I look now to my old pictures. But also I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel comfortable posting pictures of how I look now yet. I also have a small TikTok account which I want to post recovery content on soon because I want to be an eating disorder recovery coach. I have no one I know in real life on my TikTok, but the few videos I have of me are in my old smaller body and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want the same comparison aspect. I saw Jazz Jenning‚Äö√Ñ√¥s account: she was in a small body most of her life and now she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s in a larger body and people were so rude commenting WHAT HAPPENED, or WOW. It was so rude and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want that!

yuceui,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a few months into recovery, gaining weight, challenging fear foods, etc. there have been a few slip ups but overall it has been a positive trajectory. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still underweight but getting there. I found the concept of ‚Äö√Ñ√≤all in‚Äö√Ñ√¥ too stressful for me, so have been taking a bit of a slower approach. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still counting calories but using it as a way to ensure I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m meeting my minimums (this is with approval from my treating team). 
 
 Today I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m leaving to go on a holiday with my friends (11 of us) for three nights. 
 Not taking my food scales. Not taking any safe foods (someone else has organised to do the shopping and cooking). 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m so nervous. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m also excited to spend these nights with my friends and celebrate us finishing uni. 
 
 This could go either way:
 1. It could be amazing, flip a switch in my brain, help me get back to my old self who would have LOVED the idea of being away with friends with good food, cheese platters, and alcohol. 
 Or
 2. I freak out, restrict, don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t involve myself. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m really hoping it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the first. But I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seem to shake ED thoughts from creeping in (e.g. ‚Äö√Ñ√≤I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not cooking, how much oil are they going to use???‚Äö√Ñ√¥ ‚Äö√Ñ√≤We could have this same thing but with lower calories if we used low fat yoghurt‚Äö√Ñ√¥ ‚Äö√Ñ√≤you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re going to gain so much weight from this trip‚Äö√Ñ√¥) 
 
 Now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m lucky that my friends all know I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in recovery and know that this will be a challenge for me. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m just still so scared.

  Idk if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m rambling but sometimes the loneliness makes me feel pathetic and slightly miss my ED as it was some masochistic companion I had to hold on to.

oo9cgs,"Hi everyone, so during quarantine I did the dumbest thing a 17 year old boy can do, I lost weight REAL fast. I was bigger, but not fat in track and field, so I wanted to lean out for the next season and the coronavirus was happening so I realized that I could use that time to lose some weight. And I did. I was eating very little calories for an extended period of time, I lost about 30ish(175-178 ish to 147-151)or more pounds from mid March to August 2020. 
 
 The difference: [https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH](https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH)
 
 My knees became knobby, I looked really really skinny. I was always hungry, I didn't care about anything other than nutrition and I didn't even talk to any of my friends. I noticed that I didn't have any urge to masturbate or talk to girls, which wasn't rly a problem to me at the time because of corona. I noticed my facial hair under my chin didn't grow at all until a few months ago. I was kinda cold and had night sweats. I was Eating about like 1800 to 2300 max while in pre-season track and field took a hit on my body and my hamstring pulled, causing me to not compete at my best ability. By march 2021, I started reverse dieting and gradually reached 3200 calories by mid April(which still wasn't enough for a teen athlete). When we went back to school, I started interacting with other students and realized my personality completely changed. I felt like I was under them(which is ironic because before I felt I was the guy subconsciously). I had more social anxiety, my voice got lighter, and didn't have the flow of conversation anymore. That's when I realized I did something really wrong, which lead me to think I dramatically decreased my test levels. I started looking up the importance of fats in a diet and how low calorie diets lead to low testosterone and GH, and that broke me. I always wanted to develop and grow into a man and I was finally getting there before losing weight and dieting. My dad is about 6'2 and my mom is 5'8 (maybe 5'7)and I was my mom's height by the end of eight grade. I was 5'10.4 by Feb. 2020(junior year) and I really feel I was supposed to have gotten a growth spurt during this time. Unfortunately, I only grew an inch since this period(5'11.5), despite losing so much weight. As a guy, I severely underestimated the caloric needs of a young 17-18 year old male. I look even younger than I did in the early stages of the weight loss. (I'm about 171 ibs now and I feel alot better, but still not completely there hormonally)
 
  I know this is kind of a rant, but is there any chance that once I fully recover from this that my body will rapidly catch up developmentally to confiscate for the delayed development and maturity? Did this one year and a few months permanently take a few inches of my growth potential?

okzln4,"TW: mentions of diets, eating behaviours, swearing.
 
 So I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫help‚Äö√Ñ√π me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in ‚Äö√Ñ√∫safer‚Äö√Ñ√π and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫yeah well most people don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know how to respond to eating disorders‚Äö√Ñ√π / ‚Äö√Ñ√∫they were just trying to help‚Äö√Ñ√π and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification. 
 
 I often read on the internet that ‚Äö√Ñ√≤diet culture is everywhere‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EAT THAT MUCH‚Äö√Ñ√π is NOT the right answer either. 
 
 Society and media have made it ‚Äö√Ñ√≤normal‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s self to look like someone they are not. 
 
 Well, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‚Äö√Ñ√≤INTERMITTENT FASTING‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL. 
 
 You wanna know what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‚Äö√Ñ√≤HEALTHY‚Äö√Ñ√¥. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively. 
 
 Your body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t you think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.

I'll be having a roasted chicken thigh with roasted vegetables and hummus for lunch. I wasn't able to workout during my anorexia but during my recovery I was able to go on walks/runs.

nl3x78,"So I've been recovering for 3 years. But it's only really been the last year (just under) that I've been gaining weight. 
 At first I was scared of getting fat but now it's completely different. 
 It's the opposite of my old anorexic thoughts but they are just as destructive and drive me insane. 
 I'm constantly feeling like I have a masculine body, that I don't look feminine enough. I have tiny boobs and hardly any hip or bum. 
 I'm like a rectangle and I beat myself up for it everyday. 
 
 When I was seeing consistent weight gain I was feeling great and never felt bad about my body. But now weight gain has slowed down I'm feeling so bad about myself. 
 
 Always thinking I need bigger boobs. I need to be curvier. 
 
 I'm always telling myself I look like a boy, my face is too masculine, my body is too masculine. 
 
 Some days I can barely look at myself because I don't feel womanly enough. 
 I really think it's body dismorphia but the opposite of what I'm used to because I'm always told I have a long oval face. 
 But when I look in the mirror I see a short square face with a very wide jaw bone. I see masculine features where others don't get what I see. 
 
 I've never heard anyone talk about recovery in this light so I just don't know if I'm alone. 
 
 I'm so fed up of feeling bad about myself I just want these feelings to go away so I can live a normal life.

n65ai7,"Hi everyone, I have been in recovery for quite some time now but soon I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m turning 18. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve always wanted to be a pescatarian and go dairy free because I took a nutrition class in high school and we learned about how cows and chickens are raised before they are killed and sent to stores as food. It made me sad and grossed out, however, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel this way about fish because my family often catch and cook our own fish, and in my eyes, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not bad for the environment. I want to go dairy free to improve my acne and since dairy usually upsets my stomach. 
 
 However, my doctor has refused to let me go pescatarian or dairy free because she believes I need the protein in cows milk and animal products to recovery properly. My parents have also not let me because up till now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been a child and not allowed to make my own decisions. They also say that it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s restrictive. 
 
 I know being pescatarian will give me a better relationship with food and my body, I know once I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m 18 no one can force me to eat what I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to, however, I am afraid my parents will judge me and not be supportive.

ly35lb,"Hi, I suffer from anorexia nervosa (and other mental health issues) sense I was 14 years old, I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t say any other details about it so it won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be triggering.
 
 In a week or two I will go to a retreat (residential) for eating disorder, I am still working on other aspects of my mental health by going to group therapy, for almost two years, and now I am more stable and have enough tools to take the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫next step‚Äö√Ñ√π.
 
 I am scared about trying something new or that I will fail and that it will be a waste of time and money, don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to put weight on because even if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m under weight I still see myself ‚Äö√Ñ√∫heavy‚Äö√Ñ√π and need to count calories to feel less anxious.
 
 
 My ED has taken over 7 years of my life, and this is the worse that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ben, not being able to even go to the beach and wearing long pants even in the middle of summer and I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even see or smell food that I feel so nauseous.
 
 All my low self-esteem now comes by my ED, people continue saying how skinny I am or 
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫oooh do you ever eat because you look like you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Where does your food go when you are eating?I only see bones‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You need to eat you look really skinny‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat I can see it‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You look like your ill‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Do you have food in your house?‚Äö√Ñ√π
 ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Does your dad neglect you?‚Äö√Ñ√π
 And other things that trigger me so much.
 
 People have ben commenting on about my body sense I remember, every time someone had to find something bad.
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t believe when people say that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m pretty or beautiful because they are being pity and the only thing that I see is not my body, but something else like I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t belong in and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not mine.
 
 
 It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s taken over so much that I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t start a job or finish school for how much stressful it is, I am really regretting that I will go in this recovery program.
 It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s taken over my friendships and my old relationships because people cared about me and wanted me to eat but I would just say that I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to and they would get frustrated.
 It takes over my ‚Äö√Ñ√∫intimate life‚Äö√Ñ√π 
 
 But I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to get better and I think that I will actually dropping out of the retreat after a couple of days.
 
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel even validated because my dad doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand, even if I eat something small he starts saying ‚Äö√Ñ√∫oh. .is that because you suffer from ED?‚Äö√Ñ√π and that makes me want to starve myself because I need to show him and prove what is really going on.
 When I told him about the program he only said ‚Äö√Ñ√∫why all of the sudden you are putting your ED as a priority? i see you eat‚Äö√Ñ√π and that makes me feel like actually I have no problems when it comes to food or I am doing all this for attention and he is making me regret to start the program. 
 My mom and other members of the family think that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m crazy and just being childish when it comes to food and being picky and then when my therapist told to her what wad going on she didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t believe her or me, she only said that I was not that skinny and I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need to go see a doctor.
 And then when my mom/dad cook food for me and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat they always put money in the conversation saying that they payed, I mean it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s true but I told them that I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat a lot of food.
 
 The only thing that keeps me going is the support of my few friends and my GF that say that even if they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have an ED like me and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand about the situation 100% are proud of me and want the best and see me happy and succede in a carrier and be here for me when I most needed.
 
 I know that I have to do this for me and nobody else but me, but only thinking about it makes me feel anxious, depressed and so guilty about my life choices or emotions.
 What happens once I recover? Will people recognize how I look because I will be in a normal weight range? Will people criticize me saying how I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need to loose weight?

lo2143,"Today I decided to start take a few steps towards recovery and I ate a spoonful of Peas for the first time. Just plain Peas. I used to stretch every kind of food to Last me longer and adjust them to suit my cravings for so long that I never realized those Peas were actually gone REALLY bad. I have been eating them for the past 2 Or 3 weeks and never realized it was so acidic because I would only Eat 2 Or 3 of them and Mix it with various diabolical food inventions. Moreover, I ate a few bites of a chocolate and tasted NOTHING at first. It literally felt like chewing nothing. It wasn't until a few hours later that I tried them again and actually was able to sense its taste. 
 Today I learned that I forgot the taste of most of the foods. Sorry if this is basic Or very common but I felt pretty surprised at this revelation. Maybe I denied myself enjoying food for so long that I programmed myself into not tasting it? 
 At the same time, I have this nagging thought in my head that I was able to escape from the overly addictive sugar and other harmful ingredients pushed by the huge food companies and now I surrendered to them, and NOT to being a healthy person. Eating for pleasure feels like a conspiracy a lot of the times and this makes me feel defeated. Like, what if the food actually tastes like the way I tasted them today? Like, nothing?

lb8klx,"tl;dr it's a rollercoaster, but I thought if someone could use some insight, I should post maybe?
 
 I started recovery around 6 months ago, but relapsed after 3 weeks, and then came back to it in late October. What made me come back to recovery, was when my best friends sat down with me, and told me they didn't think they could sit down and watch me die anymore, and that it was becoming too much for them. So on the day they told me that, I started actual recovery.
 
 I had extreme hunger for a few weeks, and still sometimes now. I didn't run nor exercise beforehand, and so after a month, my aunt offered me to go to the gym with her. I also started craving a bunch of meats, so I naturally ate a bunch of protein out of nowhere. I started gaining muscle, and I can see I have gained so much muscle back, and yes, I also gained weight along with all this. The weight gain came super fast sometimes, and then would slow down, then go back to fast, then slow down. It's still kind of like that, but now it's up and down, but I honestly don't even weigh myself as often anymore, because it's starting to become irrelevant (VERY SLOWLY). My extreme hunger varies, I still have it on certain days of the week, and certain days it's ALMOST normal, until it hits a certain time sometimes. I will say, to people worried about huge amounts of weight gain very fast, I gained super fast within a week, and I had a massive anxiety attack, almost relapsed. In my experience, that weight isn't real weight, and it's just your body processing it.
 
 Honestly, I have had really tough moments, but I feel so much better and stronger now. I thought going to the gym would make me relapse, or restrict, but I ate even more because I felt more hungry, and I didn't feel bad. I don't feel lightheaded anymore, I can eat out, and I can be happy with my friends again, without feeling like they're worried about me. My advice, is be patient, and don't let yourself scare the living hell out of your recovery. I still have a long way to go, but I thought I would share my experience so far.

 You can see the tattoo in my post history, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the most recent post. It says, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫beyond fear lies freedom‚Äö√Ñ√π. 
 
 Getting this tattoo has helped me further commit to recovery. I know now that if relapse again I will feel like a complete fraud with this tattoo on my arm. I know I will inevitably face challenges and likely more disordered eating, but this tattoo reminds me that I never want to get as bad as I did. 
 
 This tattoo isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t just for my recovery from anorexia but everything that has happened in my life in the past two years. Before I was robbed at gunpoint, thus developing severe PTSD, I was fearless in everything that I did. The robbery completely took that away from me. Then I discovered my boyfriend at the time was a porn addict that was exclusively attracted to underage girls, which made my anorexia so much worse since I always compared myself to underdeveloped 12 year old girls. Our relationship was so toxic and it instilled so much fear in me in so many aspects. 
 
 One year since we broke up and since I decided to commit to recovery, and I can say I actually feel somewhat okay for first time in years now. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been through hell and back and I never thought that reaching the place I have in recovery would be possible. But it was, and I am thankful. I am thankful that I let go of him. I am thankful we separated. I am thankful I chose to recover. If I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t, I would have been dead by March of last year.
 
 Choosing to start letting go of fear and doing the frightening, but hard work necessary lead me to where I am today.

l9mxnd,"Ate more than I wanted to
 
 Hi :) 
 So I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m currently attempting recovery from anorexia but I am in a bit of a downer, specifically this past week.
 Today I thought I would try and follow my meal plan to which I did, but in the evening for my evening snack I ate way more than I wanted to. Alongside this, I had a takeaway which was so scary to me yet my mind sort of went F it ?? I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what happened this evening but I let go and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s scared me and I want to restrict again and not follow my meal plan tomorrow. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what to do, I hate this cycle of restricting snd then sometimes I eat a lot more than I would like to and then it just goes round and round and round in a perpetual cycle of the same old thing.
 
 Part of me wants to get better but the other part of me doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t and wants to lose the weight I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve put on in recovery plus more . It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a mindset of two conflicting points and I hate it. Part of me doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to eat but then the other part of me just wants to eat all these fatty sugary foods (and other stuff too but mostly those types of foods) which I know rationally is because I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve restricted myself of nutrients so my body is like PlEAsE FEEd M3 which I get but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just so hard to allow myself when I feel like I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t! Plus , I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still so bloody hungry and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know how I can be after what I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve eaten? My stomach is grumbling almost an hour after and another thing is that I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t stop thinking about food. Is this extreme hunger , idk I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m just ConFuSION and highly frustrated!
 
 Sorry this may not make sense I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m probably rambling a lot I just felt like I needed to get it out there.

ktih43,"(TW: rituals, implied sizes and numbers)
 
 My boyfriend (35m) and I (22f) are both actors, and have been cast in a film shooting this March. We are playing Danish Vikings and he has been bulking for the past year to gain muscle for the role. However, the shoot is nearly upon us and he begins his cut in a week. 
 
 One of the rituals I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve found most difficult to overcome during these early stages of recovery is being able to eat when nobody else is. I have found it makes it immensely easier to eat (and keep it down) when we have meals together. Especially since he is trying to pile in as many calories as possible, I can trick Ana into thinking I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m eating less because it looks small in comparison. 
 
 In a nutshell, I am guilty of constantly comparing my portions and calories to his to ensure that I eat a significantly smaller portion than he does. However, my BMI is less than 16 at the moment and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in the middle of a relapse already. I am terrified that when he starts counting calories it will send me over the edge and I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be able to recover.

iostjw,"I think some people are just need to be a higher weight than others to be healthy. No I dont meant it's bc they have more muscle, they have larger bones, bla bla. I meant they literally need to be fatter, they literally need to be a higher bf%, to be healthy. I dont care anymore if some 15 year old named suzie think that's fat logic. 
  
 
 A little backstory- in puberty, i was always the teen version of a lower but healthy bmi (teenagers dont use bmi, they use percentile, but you get what i mean). I was always in the ""acceptable"" range at school physicals. I never tripped any alarms. I was as skinny as most other students. But I was the one who, in order to maintain that weight, was passing out twice a month, not them. I was the one having a snack as my lunch, skipping my periods here and there, failing to grow in height or chest size. Not them. 
  
 
 It doesn't help that my sister in her teenage years could be literally off-the-charts underweight and still show no signs of disordered eating, still have a fully functional life, never pass out, no medical issues, always getting her period, etc. My mom loved talking about how she was a similar weight as a teenager, and spoke of my sister taking after her like a point of pride. 
  
 
 I felt like even more of a failure bc I have very tiny bones and almost no muscle so I never felt like I could blame bone or muscle for my failure to be naturally skinny. 
  
 
 Anyway, very unsurprisingly, I eventually lapsed into a full-blown ED. When I hit my LW, I started mysteriously gaining on very few cals a day. I had triggered FHA. Even my endo noted that it was an uncommon condition. I once again compared myself- why could so many people be so much skinnier without triggering FHA? I actually lost weight very slowly and relatively little of it, so why me? 
  
 
 I started weight restoration. I was partially weight restored when I stopped that in its tracks. I had reached a bmi that most young people here have. But it just wasn't meant to be. I still needed to constantly use ED behaviours to maintain that weight. I was still mentally a wreck and obsessed with food. I felt like a crazy person stuck in a normal person's body, which felt more confusing than a crazy person stuck in an anorexic body. 
  
 
 Yesterday, I had a realization- if I needed to constantly pass out and stunt my own growth to be normal-slim as a teenager, maybe it just isnt meant to be. 
  
 
 It helps me to think of being naturally skinny like being naturally good at basketball. Some people are just not meant for it. It makes no sense for a 5 foot tall person to aim for the NBA and be constantly envious of natural talents. 
  
 
 Today I stopped all ED habits. I just ate intuitively. I know I will gain weight but I'm reminding myself of the basketball analogy. I feel bad when I see so many naturally skinny people on the streets and know I can't be one of them, but I remind myself that I am good at other things. Because today, I could finally focus on pursuits I was always good at without struggling to put my food obsession in the backdrop. There are more meaningful things to have a knack for than being skinny anyway.",comparing oneself to other people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,internal,0,,,,0,,,,0,,,,0,,,,0
i61r4y,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not nowhere near fully recovered, so this might not be the complete accurate way of dealing with the judgement, or fear of it. 
 
 I wanted to say, the main reason I never wanted to gain, even though people would always tell me ‚Äö√Ñ√∫you looked so good when you weighed more‚Äö√Ñ√π. I always thought my friends wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like me as much if I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t this skinny fragile person. Of course it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s your eating disorder saying this to you, convincing you the whole world revolves around liking you for being this way, or might be something similar. 
 
 I know everyone always says to just ‚Äö√Ñ√∫ignore the thoughts‚Äö√Ñ√π. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not easy, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a constant war waging in your head, all the time. I never have liked my body, never. Even at my thinnest, even at my ‚Äö√Ñ√∫normal‚Äö√Ñ√π, or in my bigger body, I never liked it. I guess I just convinced myself that, no matter what, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll never find love, or happiness with someone, no matter what body I have. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s totally not true, of course that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s something I told myself. But it got to the point to where, I was miserable, everyday. I was punishing myself, and living for everyone else BESIDES me. I really put my body through so much, just in case it made me look more attractive by being thin. 
 
 I think in the short way, living your life for everyone else in the world besides you, isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t the way to live life. Constantly battling with yourself over your own natural instincts isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t a way to live life. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s something we have to eventually come to terms with, but once you realize how much time you spent worrying about what everyone thinks, rather than just living, you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll have so many emotions.

hs61mm,"Good day,
 
 I'm a teen male (age 17) in recovery from a binge sub-type of AN, who's confused about the whole recovery process. At the moment I weigh 56 kg (\~123 lbs), at my lowest, about 5 months ago, I was 48.8 kg (\~108 lbs). After having won the fight against the fear of consuming more caloric foods than just veg, in this case milk produce and fruit, at the very start of this summer I have been steadily gaining \~1 kg (\~2 lbs) of weight per week. Yet, I am still very confused about my current situation. 
 
 
 Here's the deal:
 
 * From the start of intense recovery (start of this summer) I still indulge in huge amounts of food consumption EVERY SINGLE DAY for breakfast and dinner (*amounting to &gt;1500 kcal each*), with a snack of fruits in between. (*Comes out to \~3000-4000 kcal/day*)
 * I live pretty actively: driving my bike everyday for a minimum of 1 hour, most of the day spend gardening and doing yard chores, spending little time sedentary. 
 
 **My questions are:**
 
 1. How come, spending days non-passively, but consuming the lower end of a recommended daily amount of kcal for recovery, **I GAIN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WEIGHT PER WEEK**?
 2. My psychiatrist says that out of the \~3000-4000 kcal I consume daily, at best only half of them get absorbed. Is that true?
 3. How come I eat breakfast, semi-lunch, dinner and snacks in between, but my body till this day has EVERY DAY binge episodes? Why hasn't it learned that there will always be food?
 4. I'm scared that this ""monster eating"" won't cease because of how long it has been going on for now!
 
 If you have any question who's answers would help in making a clearer picture of my situation - ask away :)

hretpz,"I have been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia for years now. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m 22 and the intrusive thoughts started when I was 11. It has sucked so badly and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve cried multiple times a week over the fact that I have hated my body and could never just exist as I am. It has always felt like Ana has been in the back of my head just screaming at me to stop eating. Stop eating. Stop EATING. 
 
 A few weeks ago I hit a dark place I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never been at before. 
 
 TW for self harm and ED talk 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure if you remember, but a few weeks ago I posted about how I woke up to find stretch marks on my stomach. They had appeared over night and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life. 
 
 I relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself. 
 
 And then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me. 
 
 I was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work. 
 
 Ever since then, things have been turning around. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s much easier to dismiss. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve also been doing physical activities (hiking, long walks), but for pleasure, and not as a means of punishing myself and/or trying to lose weight. I can look at myself naked and not cry. I feel good. 
 
 Ana is still there, but she isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t screaming anymore. She speaks more in a whisper, faintly hoping she can catch me in a bad moment. Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get me wrong, not every second is perfect and she still gets to me sometimes, but she no longer occupies my every waking moment. 
 
 I am by NO MEANS advocating for self harm or any form of self destruction as a means of achieving clarity and relief. This was an uncontrollable action that resulted from a deep place of self loathing and an inconsolable longing for an end to the pain. Please do not do this in the hopes of it changing your mindset. 
 
 This is what happened to me. My stomach is healing now and life is looking up. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m now dedicated to self betterment instead of oppressive destruction of my body. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m no longer listening to Ana and her restrictive deadlines. Slow and steady physical betterment for the sake of improved health, energy, and wellbeing is what I strive for now. 
 
 I never thought I would reach a point where I was okay with how I am. There is hope. Please know there is hope.

101fgdf,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never reached out for help before. I (19F) have been dealing with what I think is an eating disorder for a while. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m looking to see if anyone shares this experience and what I can do. I struggle with bipolar 2 disorder and mental illness and fell into a really bad episode last year and starved myself for months. I gained some weight back and I hate myself so much, I bury myself in oversized clothes and sob in the mirror at the sight of myself. I have bad body dysmorphia because everyone around me assures me I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t look different from before. 
 
 Instead of throwing up, I have an addiction with overusing laxative pills. If I eat too much, I take an ungodly amount of overnight laxative pills and release in the most painful, extreme way. Taking those pills constantly is so bad for you and I know that, but it makes me feel cleansed and like the food escaped my body. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m going to be honest, I wish I could just throw it up since the stomach pains I get from the laxatives is so bad, but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve only thrown up a few times in my life and hated it, so I avoided trying. 
 
 I am obsessed with how I look and every pound. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat, I starve myself completely some days. Today I drank 10 bottles of water and ate only saltine crackers. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy for me to starve because I know how to lose the weight fast. This is unhealthy and I recognize that, but I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what to do. I also don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know if this qualifies as bulimic/anorexia since I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not throwing up, but I thought this thread would most understanding. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m tired of every thought I have being about my weight.

 I just got a ton of candy and snacks as gifts from an event the past week and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been relapsing bad the last month. 
 (MENTIONS OF BINGE COMING)
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even remember the amount of what I ate because it just feels like a blur right now but I ate like 
 5 reeses cups, 40 airhead extremes (the bite size candies), a frosted sugar cookie, choc chip cookie, and like 12 frostedanimal crackers I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know??
 This happened not even 20 minutes ago in my dorm after my roommate left. I had a fine breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner + dessert and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know why the urges are coming back so strong.
 I purged a lot. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s sad because it felt so natural and I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mad I purged I was happy and relived. But the guilt of the binge is intense.
 I threw away the candy but kept a few pieces of each because I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t hide from it forever.
 Luckily I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m going home tomorrow for The Weekend so I hope this will help me ‚Äö√Ñ√∫reset‚Äö√Ñ√π and get back on track.
