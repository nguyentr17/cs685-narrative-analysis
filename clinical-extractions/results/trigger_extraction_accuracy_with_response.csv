This morning I woke up after sleeping a solid 3 hours (typical for me) drenched in sweat and shaking. I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get out of bed or stand for more than a few seconds without feeling extremely, uncomfortably hot and feeling my vision start to go dark. My body temp was ranging from 94.8-96.

Problem is I have such a fear of not working out and my schedule changing, I workout so I can eat and maintain muscle. I take my daughter to school and I spend hours at the gym where I workout and my friends are there also, I do this every weekday till I pick my daughter up and do housework and look after her. I eat &gt;!1000!&lt; calories a day and if I go over that I purge. I exercise to make this okay. I burn &gt;!500!&lt; cals a day in the gym. The binging and purging stops me from being underweight. The exercise stops me gaining weight.

10083xu,"Last night I got into a pretty horrible fight with my partner because he was drunk (more accurately he was fighting ‚Äö√Ñ√∫at‚Äö√Ñ√π me, which used to be a very common occurrence unfortunately). He‚Äö√Ñ√¥s struggled with alcoholism for many years, but last night was the first time in a long time that he relapsed. I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t go into the details (he wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t psychically or sexually abusive), but it was extremely scary and difficult for me emotionally. He has quit drinking once again (as of today), but my anxiety is through the fucking roof. 
 
 I have been trying to attempt quasi-recovery for the last few weeks, and although I intended to eat dinner last night, I did not because I was so scared and distraught by my partner‚Äö√Ñ√¥s behavior. I actually had to call out of work today, which I NEVER do, because my anxiety has been so bad. He‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been sick all day throwing up from the alcohol, and once his stomach settled he told me that he was going to maybe order a pizza (we have basically no food in the house and I have exhausted all of my safe foods, which he wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat anyway). I told myself that I should try to eat a slice of pizza, but he ended up ordering something he knew I really didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like and now he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just eating like a fucking king while I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m angry, anxious and starving and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m pissed at him for yet another reason.

 I started recovery a month ago. It's been great! I've eaten a lot, maybe even a little bit too much, but after two months of severe undereating (according to my doctor), I don't think a few days of eating too much matter. My body says otherwise though.
 
 Since starting recovery, I've gained &gt;!6 kg!&lt; of weight. I think it's the fact that my body hasn't adapted yet, but I'm not sure. Before recovery, I was eating &gt;!&lt;1000 cals!&lt; a day and still gained (yes, it's real, it happened, it wasn't a thyroid problem or anything), is this caused by that? I gained about a kilo each week back then. Is my body still insisting that my maintenance is... nothing? That I should eat nothing or I'll gain? 
 
 Is there any way to fix this? I've gained so much weight and I've become aware of all my fat rolls touching and all that again, which is one of the main reasons my ED started. I don't want to gain more, I've already gained &gt;!7 kg!&lt;, the reason why I said &gt;!6!&lt; was because I think the last one is water weight but then again, the rest were supposed to be water weight as well but they still haven't gone away!

 (Long Rant)
 
 My depression worsened few months ago and led to full onset of restrictive AAN. I made sure I hide all my pain well because I know people around me don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really get mental illness. But with restricting, I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t really hide how my body shape changed drastically in only four or five months.
 
 I have been on family vacation for the past week, and I received many probing questions or comments about my eating behavior and my weight, though no one knows about my mental health conditions. I stayed composed dealing with those, until one particular comment. We got to a new hotel and my mom found out the room has a scale. She was curious about my weight so she pushed me to weigh myself. Even with me trying to intake more during family meals, the nature of busy vacation causes a significant drop in weight. My mom got very excited and shared the news with her husband. Her ruthless/cold/cruel/full of sh*t (excuse my language) husband replied with: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫She probably throws up whenever she goes to the toilet and becoming an anorexic.‚Äö√Ñ√π
 
 I just can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t control myself after that. I went into a full breakdown crisis mode. It took me lots of effort to reach out for help, trying to do damage control before potentially developing behaviors other than pure restriction. I have also been battling with suicidal ideation: trying to stay alive has been a really hard task. And ironically, I was trying to stay alive because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want my family to be impacted for rest of their lives. On top of dealing with these chaos alone, being randomly accused and targeted is not helping. I just feel so helpless. I hate when people are so ignorant and mean. I never shared my illness with my family because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want them to worry, and I know they won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand. The only thing I have hoped is that they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t make things worse. I never even asked any support or comfort from them. But I guess with all the hiding I still cannot prevent myself from being hurt by the supposedly closest people to me. And I still have few days of vacation left with my family. With me acting out, I got the silent treatment from them, so the next few days are going to be interesting‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ¬∂.

108xqeq,"I (27f) have been married to my partner for a few months. We've known each other for 9 years, and have now been married a few months. There's a whole fucking ton to the story between meeting and here, but he is the best relationship I've ever had. He makes me feel loved, cared for, and beautiful. Sure there are rocky moments, but everyday I look forward to seeing him. To every moment spent together even if it's spent in silence, or even in times of relationship difficulties. I never even believed that a love like this could even be real. 
 
 Recently I have been really trying to push past the stagnant ""quasi-recovery"" I've been in for ages because I want the best for our future. I actually care about the future now. It's wild. 
 I have now hit a goal of being around X lbs after a long time of trying to get here. It's still underweight, but significantly closer to a ""healthy"" weight than I have generally been. I have only managed to hit this weight once since I was 16, and that was only maintained for about a month after 5ish months of IP/RTC. 
 Basically, I almost feel like I'm going through puberty again. It's hard to make sense of the changes in my body, but I am doing my best to push through. 
 
 My husband has praised me for my efforts, which I do appreciate. However, he also makes comments about my body changes/weight gain/etc. I have asked him to be extremely cautious, especially right now (I feel so fragile in trying to stay this course), in commenting on my body. Specifically I've asked him to refrain from commenting on weight gain, being heavier, whatever. For the most part, he's done quite well. And I appreciate that so much. 
 
 Yet when he's tired or had a bit to drink, sometimes he' l go off about my body. And in his mind, it's positive. And I know I should view it as positive, too. But he'll grab my ribs, or my hip bones, or whatever and comment on the changes. And I know he's trying to tell me how beautiful he thinks I am and how proud he is of my progress. But all my brain does is screech. 
 
 I'm not mad or upset with him in any way. Mainly this is just a vent, though if anyone does have advice, I wouldn't mind. I am really so deeply in love with and grateful for my husband. These moments just make me want to crawl out of my skin and go back to hard restriction. I'm doing okay, it's just... hard. My body feels like it doesn't belong to me.

yuceui,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a few months into recovery, gaining weight, challenging fear foods, etc. there have been a few slip ups but overall it has been a positive trajectory. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still underweight but getting there. I found the concept of ‚Äö√Ñ√≤all in‚Äö√Ñ√¥ too stressful for me, so have been taking a bit of a slower approach. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m still counting calories but using it as a way to ensure I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m meeting my minimums (this is with approval from my treating team). 
 
 Today I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m leaving to go on a holiday with my friends (11 of us) for three nights. 
 Not taking my food scales. Not taking any safe foods (someone else has organised to do the shopping and cooking). 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m so nervous. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m also excited to spend these nights with my friends and celebrate us finishing uni. 
 
 This could go either way:
 1. It could be amazing, flip a switch in my brain, help me get back to my old self who would have LOVED the idea of being away with friends with good food, cheese platters, and alcohol. 
 Or
 2. I freak out, restrict, don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t involve myself. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m really hoping it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the first.

 Now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m lucky that my friends all know I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in recovery and know that this will be a challenge for me. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m just still so scared.

oo9cgs,"Hi everyone, so during quarantine I did the dumbest thing a 17 year old boy can do, I lost weight REAL fast. I was bigger, but not fat in track and field, so I wanted to lean out for the next season and the coronavirus was happening so I realized that I could use that time to lose some weight. And I did. I was eating very little calories for an extended period of time, I lost about 30ish(175-178 ish to 147-151)or more pounds from mid March to August 2020. 
 
 The difference: [https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH](https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH)
 
 My knees became knobby, I looked really really skinny. I was always hungry, I didn't care about anything other than nutrition and I didn't even talk to any of my friends. I noticed that I didn't have any urge to masturbate or talk to girls, which wasn't rly a problem to me at the time because of corona. I noticed my facial hair under my chin didn't grow at all until a few months ago. I was kinda cold and had night sweats. I was Eating about like 1800 to 2300 max while in pre-season track and field took a hit on my body and my hamstring pulled, causing me to not compete at my best ability. By march 2021, I started reverse dieting and gradually reached 3200 calories by mid April(which still wasn't enough for a teen athlete). When we went back to school, I started interacting with other students and realized my personality completely changed. I felt like I was under them(which is ironic because before I felt I was the guy subconsciously). I had more social anxiety, my voice got lighter, and didn't have the flow of conversation anymore. That's when I realized I did something really wrong, which lead me to think I dramatically decreased my test levels. I started looking up the importance of fats in a diet and how low calorie diets lead to low testosterone and GH, and that broke me. I always wanted to develop and grow into a man and I was finally getting there before losing weight and dieting. My dad is about 6'2 and my mom is 5'8 (maybe 5'7)and I was my mom's height by the end of eight grade. I was 5'10.4 by Feb. 2020(junior year) and I really feel I was supposed to have gotten a growth spurt during this time. Unfortunately, I only grew an inch since this period(5'11.5), despite losing so much weight. As a guy, I severely underestimated the caloric needs of a young 17-18 year old male. I look even younger than I did in the early stages of the weight loss. (I'm about 171 ibs now and I feel alot better, but still not completely there hormonally)
 
  I know this is kind of a rant, but is there any chance that once I fully recover from this that my body will rapidly catch up developmentally to confiscate for the delayed development and maturity? Did this one year and a few months permanently take a few inches of my growth potential?

 So I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to ‚Äö√Ñ√∫help‚Äö√Ñ√π me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in ‚Äö√Ñ√∫safer‚Äö√Ñ√π and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫yeah well most people don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know how to respond to eating disorders‚Äö√Ñ√π / ‚Äö√Ñ√∫they were just trying to help‚Äö√Ñ√π and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification. 
 
 I often read on the internet that ‚Äö√Ñ√≤diet culture is everywhere‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even ‚Äö√Ñ√∫EAT THAT MUCH‚Äö√Ñ√π is NOT the right answer either. 
 
 Society and media have made it ‚Äö√Ñ√≤normal‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one‚Äö√Ñ√¥s self to look like someone they are not. 
 
 Well, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‚Äö√Ñ√≤INTERMITTENT FASTING‚Äö√Ñ√¥ (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL. 
 
 You wanna know what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‚Äö√Ñ√≤HEALTHY‚Äö√Ñ√¥. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively. 
 
 Your body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t you think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.
 
 And for all those people who thought they were helping but were just reflecting back my insecurities and diet culture: FUCK YOU. Fuck you. Fuck you. And I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m sorry you are so fucking blind you literally perpetuated deadly shit on someone because you thought you were helping. This is just about how dangerous diet culture is.

nl3x78,"So I've been recovering for 3 years. But it's only really been the last year (just under) that I've been gaining weight. 
 At first I was scared of getting fat but now it's completely different. 
 It's the opposite of my old anorexic thoughts but they are just as destructive and drive me insane. 
 I'm constantly feeling like I have a masculine body, that I don't look feminine enough. I have tiny boobs and hardly any hip or bum. 
 I'm like a rectangle and I beat myself up for it everyday. 
 
 When I was seeing consistent weight gain I was feeling great and never felt bad about my body. But now weight gain has slowed down I'm feeling so bad about myself. 
 
 Always thinking I need bigger boobs. I need to be curvier. 
 
 I'm always telling myself I look like a boy, my face is too masculine, my body is too masculine. 
 
 Some days I can barely look at myself because I don't feel womanly enough. 
 I really think it's body dismorphia but the opposite of what I'm used to because I'm always told I have a long oval face. 
 But when I look in the mirror I see a short square face with a very wide jaw bone. I see masculine features where others don't get what I see.

 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel even validated because my dad doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand, even if I eat something small he starts saying ‚Äö√Ñ√∫oh. .is that because you suffer from ED?‚Äö√Ñ√π and that makes me want to starve myself because I need to show him and prove what is really going on.
 When I told him about the program he only said ‚Äö√Ñ√∫why all of the sudden you are putting your ED as a priority? i see you eat‚Äö√Ñ√π and that makes me feel like actually I have no problems when it comes to food or I am doing all this for attention and he is making me regret to start the program. 
 My mom and other members of the family think that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m crazy and just being childish when it comes to food and being picky and then when my therapist told to her what wad going on she didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t believe her or me, she only said that I was not that skinny and I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need to go see a doctor.
 And then when my mom/dad cook food for me and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat they always put money in the conversation saying that they payed, I mean it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s true but I told them that I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat a lot of food.
 
 The only thing that keeps me going is the support of my few friends and my GF that say that even if they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have an ED like me and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand about the situation 100% are proud of me and want the best and see me happy and succede in a carrier and be here for me when I most needed.
 
 I know that I have to do this for me and nobody else but me, but only thinking about it makes me feel anxious, depressed and so guilty about my life choices or emotions.
 What happens once I recover? Will people recognize how I look because I will be in a normal weight range? Will people criticize me saying how I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t need to loose weight?

ktih43,"(TW: rituals, implied sizes and numbers)
 
 My boyfriend (35m) and I (22f) are both actors, and have been cast in a film shooting this March. We are playing Danish Vikings and he has been bulking for the past year to gain muscle for the role. However, the shoot is nearly upon us and he begins his cut in a week. 
 
 One of the rituals I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve found most difficult to overcome during these early stages of recovery is being able to eat when nobody else is. I have found it makes it immensely easier to eat (and keep it down) when we have meals together. Especially since he is trying to pile in as many calories as possible, I can trick Ana into thinking I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m eating less because it looks small in comparison. 
 
 In a nutshell, I am guilty of constantly comparing my portions and calories to his to ensure that I eat a significantly smaller portion than he does. However, my BMI is less than 16 at the moment and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in the middle of a relapse already. I am terrified that when he starts counting calories it will send me over the edge and I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be able to recover.

hretpz,"I have been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia for years now. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m 22 and the intrusive thoughts started when I was 11. It has sucked so badly and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve cried multiple times a week over the fact that I have hated my body and could never just exist as I am. It has always felt like Ana has been in the back of my head just screaming at me to stop eating. Stop eating. Stop EATING. 
 
 A few weeks ago I hit a dark place I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never been at before. 
 
 TW for self harm and ED talk 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure if you remember, but a few weeks ago I posted about how I woke up to find stretch marks on my stomach. They had appeared over night and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life. 
 
 I relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself. 
 
 And then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me. 
 
 I was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work. 
 
 Ever since then, things have been turning around. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s much easier to dismiss. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve also been doing physical activities (hiking, long walks), but for pleasure, and not as a means of punishing myself and/or trying to lose weight. I can look at myself naked and not cry. I feel good. 
 
 Ana is still there, but she isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t screaming anymore. She speaks more in a whisper, faintly hoping she can catch me in a bad moment. Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get me wrong, not every second is perfect and she still gets to me sometimes, but she no longer occupies my every waking moment. 
 
 I am by NO MEANS advocating for self harm or any form of self destruction as a means of achieving clarity and relief. This was an uncontrollable action that resulted from a deep place of self loathing and an inconsolable longing for an end to the pain. Please do not do this in the hopes of it changing your mindset. 
 
 This is what happened to me. My stomach is healing now and life is looking up. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m now dedicated to self betterment instead of oppressive destruction of my body. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m no longer listening to Ana and her restrictive deadlines. Slow and steady physical betterment for the sake of improved health, energy, and wellbeing is what I strive for now. 
 
 I never thought I would reach a point where I was okay with how I am. There is hope. Please know there is hope.

 I just got a ton of candy and snacks as gifts from an event the past week and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been relapsing bad the last month. 
 (MENTIONS OF BINGE COMING)
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even remember the amount of what I ate because it just feels like a blur right now but I ate like 
 5 reeses cups, 40 airhead extremes (the bite size candies), a frosted sugar cookie, choc chip cookie, and like 12 frostedanimal crackers I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know??
 This happened not even 20 minutes ago in my dorm after my roommate left. I had a fine breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner + dessert and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know why the urges are coming back so strong.
 I purged a lot. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s sad because it felt so natural and I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mad I purged I was happy and relived. But the guilt of the binge is intense.
 I threw away the candy but kept a few pieces of each because I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t hide from it forever.
 Luckily I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m going home tomorrow for The Weekend so I hope this will help me ‚Äö√Ñ√∫reset‚Äö√Ñ√π and get back on track.

ifu7re,"TW: Brief mention of self-harm
 
 I've been in treatment since March, back and forth from PHP and IOP. I'm currently doing virtual IOP due to COVID. I've experienced a lot of technical difficulties and I've missed two dietitian appointments because I easily forget when everything is virtual. Less than two weeks ago I had to go to the ER because of a self-harm wound. My outpatient therapist very suddenly had to move out of state without warning so now I need to find a new one and she was the only eating disorder therapist around that took my insurance so I'll probably have to go out of network. Also the therapist for my IOP group has had PTO the last two weeks so I haven't gotten to talk to her either.
 
 I was trying to connect to the meeting today and it wouldn't let me so I mossed like half of it and my dietician made some stupid comment about me ""avoiding treatment"" and it really fucking hurt. She has barely talked to me in two weeks so she has no idea what's been going on and her default conclusion is that I must be full of shit. She also said ""we might be looking at a discharge soon"" like what the fuck?
 
 This happened to me in PHP too. They threatened to discharge me when I wasn't ""making enough progress"" and said that I ""clearly wasn't interested in recovery."" I had only been in recovery for like 2 months. I mentioned that I'd tried weed once as an attempt at a coping mechanism in the past and next thing I know they were drug testing me and accusing me of using synthetic urine when it came back clean??? I don't understand this type of attitude coming from people working in mental health.
 
 I'm so sick of it. I want to recover but this isn't fucking helping.
 
 TL;DR: apparently every time I fuck up it means I must not care about recovering and I can go fuck myself.",incompassionate treatment from mental health professionals difficulty finding eating disorder therapist,0.0909090909090909,0.0416666666666666,0.0571428528326533,0.0909090909090909,0.2,0.1249999957031251,0.0909090909090909,0.0909090909090909,0.0909090859090911,0.1818181818181818,0.0714285714285714,0.1025640985141355,0.0909090909090909,0.0714285714285714,0.0799999950720003,0.0909090909090909,0.0833333333333333,0.0869565167485825,0.2727272727272727,0.1363636363636363,0.1818181773737374,0.2727272727272727,0.1,0.1463414594883998,0.0909090909090909,0.0476190476190476,0.0624999954882815,0.1818181818181818,0.1052631578947368,0.133333328688889,0.0909090909090909,0.0476190476190476,0.0624999954882815,0.1818181818181818,0.0588235294117647,0.0888888851950618,0.0909090909090909,0.2,0.1249999957031251,0.1818181818181818,0.0833333333333333,0.1025640985141355,0.2727272727272727,0.1363636363636363,0.1818181773737374,0.1818181818181818,0.1052631578947368,0.133333328688889,87,1,"external, external",1,"['missed two dietitian appointments', 'ER visit because of self-harm wound', 'therapist suddenly moved out of state', ""dietician's comment"", 'feeling threatened with discharge and drug testing']","['missing appointments', 'therapist moving away']","['missed dietitian appointments', 'losing therapist without warning', 'technical difficulties with virtual appointments']",1,"['missing dietitian appointments due to virtual appointments', 'self-harm wound', 'outpatient therapist moving out of state', 'not being able to talk to IOP group therapist due to PTO', 'dietitian commenting about ""avoiding treatment"" and possible discharge']","['missed two dietitian appointments', 'moved away therapist', 'stupid comment by dietician', 'threat of discharge']","['missed dietitian appointments', 'therapist moving out of state suddenly', 'threatened with discharge']",1,"['missed 2 dietitian appointments', 'self-harm wound', 'outpatient therapist moved out of state', 'dietician made hurtful comment', 'threats of discharge from treatment', 'drug testing']","['missed two dietitian appointments', 'therapist had to move out of state', ""can't find new eating disorder therapist that takes insurance"", 'IOP group therapist on vacation for two weeks', 'dietitian making hurtful comments', 'threats of discharge']","['missed two dietitian appointments', 'self-harm wound', 'outpatient therapist moving out of state', 'dietitian making negative comments', 'threats of being discharged', 'accusations of drug use']",1,"['technical difficulties with virtual IOP', 'missed dietitian appointments', 'therapist moving without warning', 'dietitian making insensitive comment', 'treatment team threatening discharge']","['technical difficulties with virtual appointments', 'missing appointments', 'self-harm', 'outpatient therapist moving', 'dietician making hurtful comment', 'threats of discharge based on lack of progress']","['technical difficulties with virtual treatment', 'missing dietitian appointments', 'self-harm', 'outpatient therapist moving out of state', 'receiving comments about ""avoiding treatment"" and possible discharge', 'previous experience of being threatened with discharge for not making progress', 'feeling accused of drug use']",4
i4zrqa,"So I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m having a COVID wedding. Family only, broadcasting online. Then next year we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll get dressed up again and have a reception. 
 Our stay-at-home order went into effect before I could shop for a dress. So I figured that a week or two before my wedding, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d go online and buy a white dress. No fittings, no alterations.
 But then....a store in my city opened for appointments and I got to try on a wedding dress. And I found one I love and feel beautiful in!
 But it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so triggering. Like, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m terrified if I get a dress, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll gain weight before my wedding and it won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t fit. Or when I go to try on, I have to make sure I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not bloated. 
 I was making some progress in recovery. But I tried on a dress, and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve already started backsliding. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m scared I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t look nice if I gain weight, that the sample size won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t fit, that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll get alterations and then not fit. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m scared that at our reception in a year, my dress won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t fit. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m scared I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll hate the photos.

hzikzn,"I love that there is a sub for ""older"" (urrggh) folk with an ED, because it seems like the ""teenage girl with an eating disorder"" trope is so ingrained that it's hard to find a medium where I don't feel 1) incredibly ancient or 2) a complete idiot trainwreck loser because I *still* don't have my shit together when it comes to food/mental health etc..
 
 Still, I haven't come across a lot of parents with ED in the subs and it would just be nice to have someone to talk to who can understand how that part of my life impacts my illness and vice versa.
 
 ANyhoo. Myself (31F) and my husband (30M) have a brilliant, nearly one year old son and we're currently trying to conceive our second child. And I am kinda freaking out! 
 We got pregnant with our son sooo easily AND I was at a pretty low weight (112lbs) It's not my lowest weight but it was low for me at the time. I gained a good 42lbs whilst pregnant but I was still hitting the gym for the first two trimesters and did aquanatal for the full pregnancy and was just generally too excited about being a mummy to have my usual ED/disorded thoughts. 
 Fast-forward nearly a year and I am fully restricting, obsessive about food and calories and exercising etc. And I *need* to get back to the 112lb that I was. I should also mention that I had just horrific post natal depression and anxiety and that just fuelled my ED on top of everything else...
 
 I am currently 128lbs and by this time next month I'll know if I am pregnant again or if we need to keep trying. My husband knows I want to ""get back down to my wedding weight"" He doesn't know about my ED or what my actual weight was/ is. But he is totally supporting my weight loss and I even mentioned that if we do fall pregnant right away again and I haven't lost the weight then I am gonna keep ""dieting"" and exercising during the first trimester until I am because "" loads of women don't even know they're pregnant in the first trimester anyway"" and again he fully supports this. He also doesn't think we're going to have any problems conceiving this time around because we didn't the first time.
 
 I want to fall pregnant and I know I will gain weight again when/if I do. I just feel so FUCKING OVERWHELMED y'know ? I am so hormonal and emotional and I have all these ED thoughts and targets and obsessions on top of my PND telling me what a selfish awful mother I must be because this is something I am actually spending time and energy worrying about when I have this amazing handsome loving child and I am trying to conceive another absolute blessing. And of course there's just the day to day of being a working mum and wife and all the banal shit that goes along with that...
 
 Anyway, if there's someone who can relate to THAT hot mess then I would be entirely grateful because I am absolutely drowning here Ô£ø√º√¥√â

g0thy3,"Apologies in advance for what may end up being a long, mildly incoherent rant, and for poor formatting (on mobile). 
 
 My province has been on ""shutdown"" for about a month now, and I have been out of work for just as long. I was coping okay-ish with that, mostly following a most predictable pattern of ""wake up, drink lots of coffee, smoke weed, pass the time until it's 7pm and it's time to make dinner, then game, drink a bottle of wine and binge on plain popcorn until tired"". 
 
 Concurrently, I was dealing with a water infiltration issue under my floor (basement apartment) which had started in October last year but has gotten much worse with spring and the snow melt, on which my landlord has been dragging his feet. Now...this issue was...tolerable until two weekends ago, when the water issue got so bad I had to call emergency contractors, who then came and basically ripped up and dried my floor. In the meantime, I packed up my two cats and went to live with my parents for a few weeks, while everything is getting finally fixed. 
 
 It's been a bit over a week now of being back at my parents' place. My mom is aware of my ED, and, in her way, is very supportive (which at first blew my mind because she was...less so when I first developped it 14 years ago). She doesn't pressure me to eat every meal (I just have to eat dinner), she got my dad to get me some of my safe foods so I can always have a safe snack, and she lets me make my own plate when I do eat, without comments. 
 My dad has also gotten better at commenting on what/when I eat, which is weird and surprising and unexpected, considering his petty comments fueled my ED all my adolescence. 
 
  However, the family dynamic hasn't changed, and being back there, as odd as it may seem, makes me feel like I am once again that 16 year old kid that tries to be as quiet as possible, that tries to not inconvenience or get in the way, the way an unxpected guest might. This has been brillantly fueling my restrictive ED, especially because my room is next to my parents', they go to bed earlyish and the dog stays with them (if she hears me go to the kitchen, she will jump off their bed and run downstairs. She's not a small dog by any means). So I eat like...one meal a day, with a light snack after, and 2 hours later, I can't fall asleep because all I want is to make pancakes and eat them without anyone hearing me.
 
 The point to this rant, I guess, is that I miss having my place, my freedom, my schedule, my shitty habits and my even shittier midnight snacks, but at the same time, being back home is teaching me a whole 'nother level of discipline through anxiety, and I lost &gt;!3.5lbs!&lt; in less than a week thanks to a lot of repressed trauma from my adolescence and constantly feeling like I have to prepare a justification for everything I eat.

fyp37w,"I'm here as an 18 year old. Turned 18 a week ago. But now, I'm ready to give up so so badly. I'm still in HS and on the tail end of my senior year. I got accepted into university, but none of that matters now. I'll admit. Living with my ED isn't easy. Fights over mealtimes have occurred. I've badgered my mother in the past over portion sizes and exercise is a battle. 
 
 I almost got kicked out on Wednesday/Thursday. Got my phone confiscated for calling some hotlines and trying to get some advice. I get my laptop confiscated at night. Strangely enough, my parents have stopped yelling at me but the words that they use might as well be worse than yelled insults. In the past, I got reported for some posts online and that's how I got police at my door due to the internet use but that hasn't happened in months. I've started paying for my portion of the phone line as well. I'm just... ready to honestly give up,
 
 My parents tell me that I'm to cut my hours at work because it requires me to be at home. To cap my hours at 20 hours per week. Then they want me to be out of the house from 8 am to 7 pm because they need to protect their physical health by not seeing me in the house. Dad says that he's getting symptoms of a precursor to a stroke/heart attack because of high blood pressure as well as things like shoulder/neck paralysis whenever he has to deal with or talk to me. He says my mother has some stomach issues due to the stress of dealing with me and my mental/physical health issues for 5-6 years. 
 
 Over the years, they've threatened to kick me out of the house since I was 7-8 years old. They don't bat an eye when my sister says she's had suicidal thoughts for over a year. Physical punishments happened when I was younger. Name calling. Just constantly being told that there's no way they could be abusive because of how much money they spend trying to clothe, feed, and educate us. 
 
 This time... I just want to give up completely. I'm beyond help. As my mother said, help is only for those that want to live. I've already been made weak by people understanding and being kind. I don't know the real world... I can't survive on my own.

 So I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been teetering on relapsing for a while and now shelter-in-place ramped everything up big time. After a week my team started with treatment warnings.
 
 After the warnings I started to try a little harder. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m doing three meal plan meals, missing about ~4 exchanges from that. Snacks I just started adding back. They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re still considering this ‚Äö√Ñ√∫a lot‚Äö√Ñ√π of restriction, and treatment is still on the table.
 
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know if my weight is bad. Per my team it was close to where I was before my last residential stay (also not terrible, but insurance deemed it ‚Äö√Ñ√∫worthy‚Äö√Ñ√π), but the last number I saw was much higher than that. Obviously that was a back and forth for a while after I saw it, and what number was right. I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t imagine after 2 weeks I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in any danger. Just physiologically that seems impossible.
 
 Is my ED putting me in denial or is my team being alarmist? I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even know. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have the resources to go back to treatment so I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m trying to pull it together on my own.

fnnidq,"Don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have anyone to tell this to but I got my period last night I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m feeling really weird about it. 
 
 I lost my period when I was 17 and now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m in my early 20s. In 2019 I gained ~12 pounds (still ~7-8 below a minimum healthy BMI) and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve mostly been maintaining since August. In February, I had a minor existential crisis over some spotting and last night my period came back full-swing. 
 
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know how I feel about it. When I was at my worst roughly 3 years ago, I used to swear I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d end it all if I ever got my period back. Of course I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel that way now. Last night I even felt a certain sense of relief, like, that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what I was afraid of for so long. There are so many awful things going on in the world right now that it seems so inconsequential. I feel selfish it ever mattered.
 
 Still, part of me is mad at my body for ‚Äö√Ñ√∫acting fat‚Äö√Ñ√π even though I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not, and terrified this means I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have the right to consider myself disordered anymore. I would never think this about anyone else, so I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know why I have to be so harsh on myself. I can feel my exercise addiction kicking in again (I managed to cut it about 25% last year!) and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m guessing things will be downhill from here, especially as a national quarantine seems imminent, but I want to take a moment to appreciate the fact that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m probably the healthiest I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve ever been.

ewdfr8,"All right folks, this may be the millionth time I'm attempting recovery, but something happened to me that seriously turned the switch and I'm taking this as a sign of ""now or never,"" otherwise known as, bitch you've been at this for 26 years, that's enough.
 
 From about Christmas to just a few days ago, I went through a particularly awful phase of binging and purging. We're talking almost daily BP sessions, sometimes twice a day, followed by periods of restriction. All in all, a total mess and it was the worst my ED has been in a long time. 
 
 Then yesterday, I just spent my 37th birthday in absolute pain because of a severe lower back injury I sustained on Tuesday, the same injury that took me over a month to recover from in September 2018. All of the fun plans I had for my birthday went flying out the window with my body's health. As I'm struggling to find a comfortable position to rest on the couch, I just got so fed up with my ED bullshit and realized that I'm completely fucking up my body's health. I swear the combination of my ED and lack of exercise (because I didn't want to gain fucking water weight of all things, I stopped engaging in healthy exercise to counteract my sedentary desk job) culminated in a sharp decline in my overall condition, leading to this ridiculous injury that was completely avoidable.
 
 I'm seriously so pissed at myself for caring so much about my body's appearance over its health. I'm in so much fucking pain every time I walk. I'm bent over like an old lady and walking in the weirdest shuffle motion, sitting for even 5 minutes at a time is uncomfortable, and I can hardly get any work done. 
 
 Worst of all, I'm starting a new job on Monday that I'm SO excited for, but I'm afraid I won't be well enough to actually go into the office on my first day. What a great way to make a good first impression, eh?
 
 This ED is fucking up my life and health and I hate it. I'm so done with 26 years of bullshit that have put my health through the ringer and this injury is literally the straw that broke the camel's back. I know I still have lots of work to do (mentally/emotionally), but I'm finally ready to leave this ED behind. I don't know what recovery looks like for me and maybe it's a bad idea to try to do this on my own, but I'm going to take it one day at a time and keep reminding myself of how much I don't want to deal with this pain again (sitting here typing this right now, I am so uncomfortable that I want to scream). Seriously, if I don't have my health, I have nothing.
 
 I haven't been part of this community for very long, but from the bottom of my heart, I'm sending you all so much love and hope that you find your ways to recovery, whatever that may be for you. I promise you, even after dealing with ED for so much of my life, change IS possible. It just took a fucking painful back injury to get ME there.

e9knfl,"So I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve struggled with anorexia (b/p subtype) off and on for 10 years. In my late 20s. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve recently hit a new low this year, thanks to plummeting into a depression that has killed all my motivation, creativity and drive. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m a musician and have stopped playing or writing. Throughout my 20s I was at least able to maintain some semblance of normalcy while keeping my disorder at bay and not letting it consume me entirely, my worst fear has always been losing my identity to my disorder. I used to want to pursue music, make things, be someone. Now I just want to lose weight, b/p, restrict, isolate and sleep. 
 Now here I am almost 30 and still struggling, just as bad as I was back then but this time I have a partner, a job, a dog and bills to pay. I feel like such a failure. I work in a chaotic restaurant which also fuels my disorder in many ways (I grew up in chaos so it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s very familiar) and isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t good for my mental health long term. I feel like I have lost my purpose in life and I no longer know who I am. A big part of me really wants to go back to school but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been so long and I am afraid of debt and not being smart enough. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m at my lowest weight right now but because I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m short/petite it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not super obvious. Which I hate. 
 My partner basically gave me an intervention today, telling me that now is the time to get treatment so I can get better and we can plan for our future. I feel so guilty and scared. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t feel sick enough to deserve to go to treatment and I never have. But if I wanted to go, I could and I am lucky to have that option.

aojotp,"My roommate is very kind and just finished literally working a shift that was basically two days long. We‚Äö√Ñ√¥re casually talking about dietary changes (I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been on a doctor supervised dietary change which has impacted my fitness &amp; weight/appetite) and he comments about how we should just hit the gym more so I can ~get abs too!!! 
 
 I know he didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t mean it like that but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been a hell of a month. Not being able to eat a lot of protein like I normally do means I haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been able to maintain my gainz, and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been super hungry (just bought 5HTP to help). I just took a nice photo with my boyfriend at a wedding - but looking at it this week, I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t realize how large my midsection looks in it. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been struggling to not relapse, as I miss being underweight. I miss the high of starvation. All of this... and my best friend may be getting tubed soon, as she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s in a medical stabilization unit for her ED, and having a hard time. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m worried about her. And I have to fly to Boston immediately after work (aka I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t be there until 2 am) to be there for a friend whose father is dying.

ajxowr,"Hi all, (TW for lots of calorie talk &amp; estimation)
 
 You may remember me from that failed recovery attempt a few weeks ago.
 
 Well, I'm sort of half arsing it again. I've upped my calories to about 1000, haven't weighed myself but am still very bloated &amp; feel pretty nasty. I reckon that may be down to a large consumption of vegetables...
 
 But anyway, husband is taking us (myself &amp; our daughter) out for gelato today. The menu of this place is terrifying. ""Sky scraper sundae"", ""Loaded Belgian waffle"" that sort of thing. I get that it's a ""treat"" or it's supposed to be. This is no treat for me. They don't provide nutrition or calorie information &amp; I hate that. 
 
 The problem lies in that sure, I could use all my calories on an ice cream sundae. But then I can't eat anything else. &amp; I'm trying to eat more regularly &amp; up the calories slowly, not have one big calorie bomb.
 
 Looking at the menu I see they do scoops of gelato in a cup. So I thought, I'll have a scoop of that. Husband insists I'm going to have 2 scoops. Okay, fine. But then can I still have my salad &amp; yogurt at dinner? Or will I be way over? *I don't know because they don't have calorie information*. It's just really frustrating me. I'm never really hungry &amp; I don't know if I'm supposed to be hungry for dinner if I had ice cream for lunch! Wtf is normal here?!
 
 I've guessed ""a scoop"" to be 270 calories but I really have no idea &amp; feel I'm probably underestimating. I've built this up massively &amp; I'm not going to enjoy it in the slightest now &amp; I've worked myself up about it so much. I'm just really annoyed.

ah6m7m,"My teeth are disgusting (although I brush regularly &amp; always have!). I haven't seen a dentist in almost 20 years.
 
 I purge maybe once or twice a week these days &amp; have suddenly begun to clench my jaw &amp; teeth in my sleep. I've noticed what I assume are abfractions (small tooth fractures where tooth meets gum I believe - meaning my teeth look like they have a dent at the top) in a lot of my teeth both upper &amp; lower...unfortunately mostly in front. I also have one tooth that seems to be turning around! I'm sure there will be a fairly long waiting list so I won't even get seen for a while but I want to at least get the ball rolling.
 
 I assume from what I can see I have a lot of damage (chips, hairline cracks, craze lines) &amp; enamel erosion along with staining where the enamel has worn away. 
 
 Has anyone been to a dentist in the UK on the NHS &amp; just straight up told them you have an eating disorder? I want to be honest so they can help repair or minimise the damage &amp; any future damage but at the same time, I'm in my thirties, I know full well I shouldn't do what I do &amp; it's ridiculous &amp; I don't want to be lectured. 
 
 Recovery was a bust &amp; made me feel worse &amp; anyone trying to push me towards that right now, especially a stranger, is not going to make me very happy. So I thought even before the proper appointment I could sort of give them a heads up. Almost a ""Hello, I'd like to make an appointment but wanted to warn you there may be a lot of damage due to an eating disorder I have &amp; my extortionate consumption of diet fizzy drinks"" sort of thing...so they can be prepared for the mess that is my mouth. 
 
 I hate the idea of the dentist &amp; I know they won't do any cosmetic work on the NHS...but my confidence is zero when it comes to my teeth &amp; if they can maybe save them or at least advise me on better oral care &amp; make them look a *bit* better I might actually smile with my mouth open again.

 I'm recovering... Idk if I should tell her that those things trigger me, I feel like it would be egocentric or selfish.

For example, before the Easter holidays, one teacher gave us a little Easter egg to each one of us (she's a cutieeeÔ£ø√º‚Ä¢‚à´Ô£ø√º‚Ä¢‚à´), but after picking mine I heard someone saying ""Oh, no, I'm on a diet"", and then someone like ""I'm being so bad, I should go and work out after this!"".

z5fb2n,"When I was a teenager (around 10 years ago) I used to be really bad. Hospitalized bad.

 I was doing so well. 
 
 I moved out of my apartment after living in a very walking-friendly part of town to a place no one walks, and, i stay inside all day so naturally my weight went up because I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t walking 30 min to school everyday and walking to my friends houses and to go get food and hand out. I never realized that when I stopped walking (especially I went into a coma and had to be in a wheelchair or walker for a while so very sedentary life style), even though for my conditions I should be doing minor exercise daily.
 
 The big problem is I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been stopping all the medications I can that I heard have caused weight gain for people and my doctors don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want me to go off them and I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even tell them!

 My fianc‚àö¬©e also has in an ED recovery journey and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been feeling so alone I finally fessed up to her but when she tried to help I realized I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want help, we got into a tiff. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve gone too far off the deep end and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the holiday season and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not growing any residue things like drink my paper mint mocha creamer (which I am normally excited all year for). But it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been in the fridge for weeks‚Äö√Ñ¬∂and I broke down and ate Dairy Queen yesterday and all I want to do it cut it out of my stomach I feel so gross. The holiday season is here and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not ready for all the weight gain the holiday goodies have in store. There‚Äö√Ñ√¥s going to be pictures of me.
 
 I need help. My fianc‚àö¬©e can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t help me because she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s at the point where she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s gonna start agreeing with me (we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re about the same size) and then we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re both gonna be fvcked.

zibh6l,"I was at the store today and I saw some girl with jeans that were literally falling off of her body. My ED brains logic said to me, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫no one willingly buys jeans that are that loose, so she must have lost tons of weight and she has an ED‚Äö√Ñ√π. I mean‚Äö√Ñ¬∂it does make sense, no one is going to buy new jeans that are falling off their emaciated body. This spiraled me and I realized that my jeans are not that loose and that I have plenty of weight to lose from my fat thighs. My ED voice said ‚Äö√Ñ√∫you have more work to do‚Äö√Ñ√π. Like wow thanks CUNT! Iiving this this Ed CUNT in my brain 24/7 is fucked. She‚Äö√Ñ√¥s like GET TO WORK BITCH!! So even though I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve lost some weight and my pants are getting looser, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not enough. My jeans must be falling off of my body in order for me to feel like I lost enough weight.

z9o2vn,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been struggling with anorexia for 6 years now and I am 20 years old. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been through multiple relapses but this one has been the worst and physically I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not in a good place. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve once again started the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫recovery‚Äö√Ñ√π process, but this time I am taking a much different approach (more of harm reduction and a much slower pace). I have increased my food, added more variety to my diet and am working on myself and mindset everyday (which has been a huge challenge in itself). I posted a photo on my Instagram for my birthday which has now circulated around my extended family (who have not seen me in this state) and it is a shit show. 
 
 They are all calling/texting my parents blaming and shaming us. They believe I need to be in a hospital and questioning how my parents let it get this bad. It makes me sick to my stomach because this illness has absolutely destroyed my parents and it kills them to see me like this, and now they are dealing with all this. They are doing everything they can to be there for me and help/support me in the best way for me. They don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand that throwing me into treatment/in the hospital will not magically cure me. They don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand that ‚Äö√Ñ√∫just eating‚Äö√Ñ√π will not make everything go away.
 
 I think the most frustrating thing is in the past years when I looked ‚Äö√Ñ√∫healthy‚Äö√Ñ√π no one cared. No one cared if I was so depressed and uncomfortable with my body and hated myself. All because I ‚Äö√Ñ√∫looked healthy‚Äö√Ñ√π.
 That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s the thing people don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t understand about anorexia, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a MENTAL ILLNESS. 
 Trust me, me and my family have tried everything. No one has the right to judge our decisions. I feel like I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even show myself at family get togethers now, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even feel welcome at this point because of the judgment.
 
 What kills me the most is the blame being put on my parents, especially since I am 20 YEARS OLD. People expect them to fix it and ask ‚Äö√Ñ√∫why are you not doing anything‚Äö√Ñ√π. Well, because they CANT. No one can force you to recover. The only way recovery works is if you choose it yourself. 
 
 It kills me to see my parents not only dealing with a sick daughter and doing there absolute best to be there and support me (which they have been amazing at) but are now dealing with all the judgment and drama of other people thinking they know what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s best/right when they haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even dealt with it before.

yxh9el,"When I was in middle school, I think, my sister told me to following anorexic tips for weight loss tips since I obviously wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t develop anorexia. 
 
 I was always heavy, and my sister was always skinny. She was skinny and incredibly smart and fit and I felt like the exact opposite.
 
 I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think she was being intentionally spiteful, I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think she‚Äö√Ñ√¥d even remember that moment. 
 
 The first time I met her high school boyfriend he said, seconds after meeting me, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫she isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t as fat as you said.‚Äö√Ñ√π 
 
 I definitely don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have anorexia. I love food too much, I do. But I do not have a healthy relationship with food. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m the lw I have ever been, low low end of healthy bmi. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t see my sister often will see her in a couple days. Last time she saw me I was still at one of the lw I had ever been, now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m &gt;!10-15pounds less!&lt; 
 
 Part of me wants her to think there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a problem, but a bigger part of me wants this to go unnoticed so I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t have to talk about anything and I can continue with certain things. As a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫new‚Äö√Ñ√π adult, not seeing family as often is so freeing. 
 
 This isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t weight loss anymore. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t like how I look like at any stage of anything, I could care less at this point. Control is so powerful and addicting.

yn63jb,"I had an ED PROFESSIONAL basically tell me that she can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t help me because I am in harm reduction mode. I told her I am trying to heal my metabolism and reverse diet, but I cannot mentally handle gaining weight, nor do I need to gain weight physically. Her response was basically, well if you‚Äö√Ñ√¥re not going to do recovery in this perfect way of 3 meals, 3 snacks and gaining weight then that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not recovery. I ripped her a new fucking asshole and told her that it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Ed professionals like her that is keeping people sick because of the expectations and recovery standards that you hold over the heads of people who truly need someone to meet them where they are. To be denied care because the person isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t ‚Äö√Ñ√∫doing recovery‚Äö√Ñ√π good enough is such a fucking paradox. That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s like telling a drug addict that they can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t go to treatment until they are completely clean off the drug. Like what?! I told her IM IN HARM REDUCTION RECOVERY. Not everyone has the safety, the proper living environment, financial or emotional means to gain tons of weight and do your perfect version of recovery.

omqwhw,"So I gained a lot of weight in my late teens, then lost a lot of weight, more than what I weigh now and naturally got left with some loose skin. I have already had one operation to remove it on my neck, and was told by my plastic surgeon that surgery on my breasts and tummy would most likely be covered by insurance if I wanted to get those operated on as well, which I definitely do. 
 
 The problem is that it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all I can think about a lot of the time, and the skin makes me feel ugly. Even when I was at a much higher weight, I had some excess skin and I remember thinking that I would rather be heavier without it than thin and have it. I guess I changed my mind at some point and sort of focused on numbers until I hit a weight where I had to recover or my life was going to become much more complicated, and since late last year I have been in recovery. My eating is okay right now, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d say pretty normal. I have been maintaining for months. I could gain some more weight, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m at the minimum ‚Äö√Ñ√∫healthy weight‚Äö√Ñ√π but the doctor I see doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seem concerned and I eat whenever I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m hungry, sometimes even when I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t deal with any other ED behaviors at the moment so I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m doing pretty well on that front.
 
 But yeah, the loose skin‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ I think about it all the time and can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t wait until I can have more surgery to remove it. Like I said, the breast lift and tummy tuck (I assume these are the surgeries that I would have) are very likely to be covered by insurance, but I also have excess skin on my arms and thighs and was told that these surgeries I would have to pay out of pocket for if I were to get them.
 
 Sometimes I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even want to leave the house because thinking about this makes me feel so down even though my clothes cover it, unless I were to wear sleeveless or crop tops which I never do. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure what to do about this. Obviously I shouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t base my happiness around this but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so hard not to think about these ‚Äö√Ñ√∫flaws‚Äö√Ñ√π. I have thought of joining a gym but I have other health issues that make working out difficult. Plus it would not remove the loose skin, only maybe make it a little less visible if I gained some muscle underneath it? I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not sure but supposedly it has helped some.

olr9l5,"So I've been friends since we were like 16 and I'm 22 now. I'm not in high school, I'm a grown woman who goes to school, has worked, and has other responsibilities to attend to in life besides my eating disorder. I have Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Purge Subtype by definition, and when we met I strictly restricted. When I met her I refused all food, I was in and out of hospitals with feeding tubes, all that crap. Now I do all the grocery shopping, I cook, I eat over 1200 calories per day, but I do struggle with maintaining a healthy weight and deal with laxative and exercise abuse. I don't binge but I do engage in compensatory behaviors that honestly I try to keep private from people outside of my family and a few trusted friends because a lot of people just don't understand anything beyond starving, vomiting, whatever they've heard eating disorders are. 
 
 So my friend wanted to hang out this week and even though I literally cook dinner almost every fucking night for my family, go out to eat with them, all that shit, she makes everything about food. She looks at me and sees that I am underweight and just believes that I ""never eat"" and that pisses me the fuck off as I pour my creamer in my coffee and sit here in bed with my leftovers from last night that really pisses me off okay. She asked if I wanted to go out to eat or do something else and honestly with buying groceries and my car payment and my college tuition lately I'm not sure if going out to eat would be ideal because it does cost a lot of money that I could use towards groceries for us or my car or whatever I need, but I do want to hangout. I just don't want to spend a ton of money, you know? So I said hanging out at either of our houses is cool with me honestly (I can make myself food where ever I am, I have food at home), and she said the dumbest shit. She said she likes to go out to eat with me to ""make sure that I'm eating even when we're hanging out and not sacrificing my health hangout."" I understand the thought but she's done this a lot where she'll just randomly ask me if I'm eating and crap and it makes me feel super triggered by old feelings and like I'm being watched for how I eat? I try to eat relatively normally and my family and other friends don't comment on how I eat so this just makes me really pissed. I've explained to her that my eating disorder constitutes a lot more than not eating but this just makes me feel super invalid. The ignorance of it makes me feel like every time I voluntarily eat, I may as well just not even have an eating disorder if that makes sense and maybe it's just made up.

mmjq69,"**There will be brief mentions of restriction and childhood abuse ahead. Please don't read on if you're not in a place to handle that right now.** Please also note that this post is very stupid and I'm honestly embarrassed that it hurt me enough that I felt the need to make a post about it. 
 
 So, look. We all know which sub I'm talking about. I won't name it because I don't want to encourage brigading and also it is totally within their rights for them to enforce any rule they see fit. I understand why they've done this, especially considering the amount of heat they get from subs like these. But - one of the most popular 'dieting lifestyle' subs, or whatever you want to call it, banned people with a history of eating disorders today. They have categorically stated that we're not welcome and will be permabanned if we have a post history that mentions having an eating disorder. 
 
 I know most people here hate that sub. I know many people who have only ever had a restrictive disorder feel some kind of way about it and I totally respect that. If that is the case, you may want to dip out here. I loved that sub and I genuinely believe it saved my life. 
 
 I'll skip the novel, but the cliff notes version is that I was neglected and abused in many ways throughout my childhood. I got out lacking some very basic self care skills. I was diagnosed with anorexia pretty young. I attempted to recover without any real professional help and went on to develop bulimia instead. I had no idea how moderation worked - I'm an all or nothing type of guy. I was never taught about nutrition, portion control, food groups, when to eat, how much to eat, when to stop, what counts as binging, what counts as restriction. When I developed bulimia my life spiralled and my health took a very sudden turn for the worst. My days revolved around food and guilt and misery. 
 
 I discovered **that** lifestyle by accident, and with it I discovered **that** sub. I swear to you that shit saved my life. I lurked for years, never really contributed a lot, and I'm not sure if I ever even posted there on this account. But that lifestyle saved me and gave me the skills to keep me afloat. I know that attracts a lot of eye rolls from people who say that lifestyle is impossible for someone with an ED to maintain safely, but it taught me *actual* self control, not the bullshit anorexic version I had before. 
 
 It taught me how to take care of myself by setting reasonable boundaries - introducing boundaries to my life was a genuine act of self love and turned shit around for me both in terms of eating and other acts of excess. That lifestyle taught me how to reduce and eventually cut out binging entirely - because I knew when to eat and when not to. It was as simple as that and it sounds stupid but I was literally never taught that. Through that community I found out a lot of the basics like how much you should be eating in the first place. It also taught me that you don't go on restricting indefinitely - that you *can* end your restriction and it *isn't* a failure. It can be a positive thing and it's a healthy cycle when done correctly. 
 
 Now, granted, I've relapsed and I currently restrict unhealthily once again. But that has more to do with my current personal circumstances. It has nothing to do with that lifestyle - I stepped away from it when I relapsed because to me it was healthy and a relapse is not healthy. 
 
 Anyway. It is so ***incredibly*** stupid to feel hurt by this and I know it. Mods there said themselves it isn't their job to parent us - and I respect that. It just hurts because in a lot of ways, I did feel very safe browsing over there. I did learn skills I should have learned from parents. I do feel hurt from this that is definitely disproportionate. When I read that we were unwelcome there it genuinely physically hurt me for a second which is such a stupid reaction. I've just lost something that meant a lot to me - which is stupid because I only ever lurked anyway. 
 
 It feels like I've got to genuinely mourn the fact that I'm not welcome in the first place that gave me stability with my eating. It was the first time I ever thought about recovery and it was the first time I ever got to a point where I was genuinely in control. It hurts to have that place make an enemy of people like me when it was such a positive thing for me. 
 
 Look, I'm so sorry to have made a post like this and it's honestly embarrassing that I felt the need to make this. I feel a little better just from explaining why I felt hurt by something that seems so stupid. It just hit me pretty hard in a way I wasn't expecting. It probably isn't about the sub - it's probably deeper than that and I should raise these feelings with my therapist. Obviously, not the job of anyone on the internet to accommodate anything or anyone they don't want to, and I take responsibility for these immature feelings - this isn't the fault of anyone over on that sub, this is entirely on me. 
 
 I just wanted to share these feelings with a group who might understand them in some way.

m1gwk4,"I've been going to the doctor a lot and begging for referrals for a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and have been deciding whether I want to do inpatient treatment. Finally got my referrals to get someone decent to check my heart and refill my ulcer medicine. My anorexia relapse has been really bad, my BMI is in the 12's, I'm 74.6 pounds and I'm not super short, I'm abusing laxatives, having incontinence issues/losing feeling in my colon, experiencing numbness in my limbs every few days, weakness, heart palpitations, frequent fevers of 102+. It's been really awful. After I got out of the hospital in February I started getting more frequent labwork which has shown consistently low sodium, potassium, glucose, along with high cholesterol. My body is just all over the place and I really want to wean off the laxatives and get help. Yesterday I had a telehealth appointment again to go over my recent labs, he tells my my labs aren't that good, but it's no big deal because ""you have no real symptoms!"" I said, what do you mean I have no symptoms? I've been admitted to the hospital and had to come in a few times because I've had fainting, dizziness, choking on vomit in my sleep, and chest pain. Been honest about everything including the laxatives, to which he just blows off and says, ""well stop taking 'em!"" even though last time I did that I went in withdrawal and got admitted to the hospital and needed fluid drained because I got so swollen I couldn't walk. 
 
 At the end of the phone call he says, ""well if you're having some symptoms drink some Gatorade. We gotta get you eating again and fix that anorexic problem!"" and started laughing.

lihm7k,"So I'm relapsing and it's awful, I didn't have much room to begin with. It's only been like two weeks and I feel so burnt out. I'm 76 lbs and my BMI is like 13.1. I was in the hospital last week for dehydration, I went because my chest was hurting and it was hard to breathe and they said my sodium levels were low and I was dehydrated and kept me for a few days. During those few days I felt so overwhelmed by my fear of the hospital and I barely ate. Each night my mom brought me grilled chicken from chick fil-a (safe food for me) and I had some broccoli and grapes. It's been a week now and my appetite is gone. Before I was eating 2 meals per day and 2 snacks. Now I am eating 2 ""meals,"" one which is substantial and one that's just yogurt. I've been getting full so fast and am forgetting to drink water. My body feels so weak that when I'm home alone I don't have the energy to fill my water cup from the fridge. I've been staying with my mom at night because I'm in so much pain and feel so weak. 
 
 She has said that my breathing sounds very labored. I get out of breath very easily. For example, yesterday after dinner I loaded the dishwasher and within 10 minutes I was shaky and out of breath to the point where I felt like I could pass out and throw up. She said she's noticed at night I'm breathing so heavily, I wake up constantly gasping for air. In addition, my skin has started to peel all over. I haven't used anything different but the skin on my hands is peeling, around my lips, cheeks, chest. It's so nasty looking. I'm trying to get down 8 ounces of juice right now and I still have half left. It's been 40 minutes already. I feel so tormented by this and can't find a therapist that isn't over $130 PER HOUR. I can't afford that. :( I have severe ptsd as well and know that has made eating harder. I'm having night terrors and nothing seems all that desirable and I need constant reassurance to eat. Oh I also forgot I'm having muscle spasms. Like my leg will start spasming to the point where I scream, or I'll lose control of my fingers in my hand for a few minutes straight. I had a telehealth appt yesterday and she said to come in for labs on Tuesday. Even on the phone she said I sounded very out of breath and asked if I was okay. She had me take my vitals and said my heart rate was really high (in the hospital it was up to 149 resting, yesterday it was in the 120's laying in bed) and blood pressure runs low. I don't know what's wrong. I've weighed a little lower than this before when I was younger but i feel like my body can't take it this time. What are these symptoms and does anyone else relate?

Alright, fortunately not diabulimia) since I was 14 and since then have toppled back and forth between an underweight and healthy BMI. I finally thought I had settled on recovery after two years of generally not engaging in behaviors and maintaining my weight. I stopped weighing myself a year ago and I literally no longer cared about my weight.
 
 Then BOOM! I go to buy jeans and they don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t quite fit. Not entirely sized out, but like, definitely different. So I did it. I weighed myself.
 
 Woooo boy. Ya girl gaint.
 
 Nothing mind boggling to the average person, and the weight is healthy and pretty safely distant from either end of the spectrum. But this is a weight I promised I‚Äö√Ñ√¥d kill myself immediately at if I got to it. Not gonna do that, though.

 It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s funny how much denial kicks in for so long without tangible data though because?? like most days I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t agonizing about being fat like I used to. I was impressed by the muscle I gained at work albeit a little upset with the ratio of my thighs to everything else but I also thought I looked petite most days (spoiler: she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not).

 I hate myself so much because of my job and I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t just accept who I am and what my body is like. The fact that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m making art and putting beautiful things out in the world is just so valuable to me I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t give it up.

nc2cz5,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve struggled with my body image since I was eight, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m now 14. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve also never had the best relationship with food for some reason. Because, I struggle with my body image, I would starve myself, which was pretty easy considering that I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even like eating. I was around 12 when the self starvation began, it was on-and-off behaviour since sometimes I felt pretty good but sometimes I would eat as little as 200 calories per day. 
 
 My sister is really thin. She‚Äö√Ñ√¥s underweight due to her inability to gain weight. I see her wrists, her collarbones, her spine, and I want that. I want to be thin, I want to have thin arms and legs. She is gaining weight and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m glad to see it, she also struggles with her body image since she wishes she were at a healthy weight. 
 
 My dad would always say I looked ‚Äö√Ñ√≤full‚Äö√Ñ√¥. I think about it a lot. I remember trying to become fit, in a healthy manner and he said that, and I gave up. He‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been saying it since I was little and I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t pay much attention to it because I didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t care, until I did. 
 
 I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never talked to anyone besides two people about my eating issues. I never told my psychiatrist nor my therapist, and I want to, I really do, but I just can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t bring myself to. I know they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll tell my parents and they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll make me eat; they‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll pressure me into eating. That is terrifying. The idea of someone watching me eat while making me do it is just not great. I also don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to tell them because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to stress my parents out about me having another mental-health-related issue. I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want them to be tired of me and get mad at me.
 
 I got surgery two weeks ago and haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eaten much since. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m always nauseous and I want to throw up. The most calories I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had since would probably be 500. I weight myself when I get the chance. I used to be around 98 pounds and now I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m at 90. Ive lost around 8 pounds in the last two weeks. I know it isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t healthy and I want help, but I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t bring myself to do it. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s my fault I got to this point. I should‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve stopped starving myself but I just couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t and now I barely know who hunger is. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not hungry anymore, all I am is dizzy and nauseous. If I eat properly I want to vomit, I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m just too full. 
 
 I can hardly bring myself to finishing a meal. My mum made chicken with rice today and I ate two bites. I just couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t. Ive been in bed the past two weeks and I just can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think. Theres nothing in my brain. I sleep when I want to eat, and then I wake up without hunger. But I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m tired because I wish I could eat without wanting to throw up, and I wish I wasn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t more terrified of being watched and pressured into eating than a tsunami.",body image issue comment from dad,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.3333333333333333,0.4,0.3636363586776859,0.1666666666666666,0.1428571428571428,0.1538461488757398,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.1333333285333335,0.1666666666666666,0.0526315789473684,0.0799999963520001,0.1666666666666666,0.0833333333333333,0.1111111066666668,0.3333333333333333,0.2222222222222222,0.2666666618666667,0.1666666666666666,0.125,0.1428571379591838,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.1333333285333335,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.4,0.3636363586776859,0.1666666666666666,0.1111111111111111,0.1333333285333335,0.3333333333333333,0.2222222222222222,0.2666666618666667,168,1,"internal, external",1,"['appearance of underweight sister', ""father's comments""]","['her sister being thin', 'her father calling her ""full""']",,1,negative comments about body image,"['dad saying she looked ""full""', 'recent surgery']",father calling her full,1,"['father comment about looking ""full""', 'surgery and accompanying nausea']","['sister being underweight and thin', 'father making negative comments about body size', 'recent surgery leading to nausea and weight loss']","['dad saying she looks ""full""', 'recent surgery causing nausea and weight loss']",1,"['dad commenting on body', ""seeing sister's thinness"", 'surgery', 'nausea']","[""comparison to sister's body"", ""father's comments"", 'recent surgery']","[""father's comments about body"", 'surgery', 'nausea after surgery', 'weight loss']",4
naihgl,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had a weird/toxic relationship with food since I was 8 due to body image issues. Since then I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve struggled to enjoy food without thinking about its calories or how it‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll make me look or how much weight it could make me gain. I wouldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t say I have an eating disorder but then again I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve never mentioned how hard it is for me to eat without worrying to my psychiatrist nor therapist. I do however starve myself constantly and try to eat as less as possible, and I weight myself around twice a day. I do not purge and I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t binge. I just have a bad relationship with food and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m afraid it could lead to something more serious. Also, I got surgery not too long ago and have been nauseous since, I haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been eating a lot and I want to throw up most of the time. I also think my parents suspect I have some type of eating issue and they always ask if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve had lunch or breakfast and if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve been eating.

He wasn't mean about it, he just said a couple of times without prompting that I could go on a diet if I wanted to as long as I didn't go overboard. We agreed on 120 as a goal weight. Then there was this thing with him making a female friend online that I was uncomfortable with. Mostly because he didn't tell me about it and then inserted a reference to her in a romantic short story he wrote for me when were first married (17 years ago). He stopped talking to her because I was depressed by it. I just got to 119 (although he doesn't know yet) and he seems completely uninterested in me physically. I know that it could be just that the last four days have been stressful for him with random stuff going on with the kids and work.

e00n8q,"Hello all, I am looking for some advice on how people lose weight while being in recovery for an eating disorder. I am recovering from restrictive eating and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m seeing a dietian and therapist. Because my dietian has been making me eat 3x more then I was I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve gained some weight. She told me the weight was temporary but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s been 2 months now and it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s not going anywhere. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s making me super depressed and I feel myself wanting to go back into my old ways because it seemed to be working before. I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve told this to both my therapist and dietian but they always brush it off or when I ask my dietian how can I safely lose weight she just starts talking about how it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s normal for our bodies to change at this age and that we need to learn to accept it. But I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t accept it. I may not look ‚Äö√Ñ√∫fat‚Äö√Ñ√π to most people but I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m much heavier then I used to be and my goal weight is not under weight it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just average for my height (right now I feel like I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m on the edge of being average weight/over weight). I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m so frustrated that I can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get any guidance from them over this. Also I try to work out but because I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m so depressed about my body it takes everything in me to make it to the gym or off the couch after work so if I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m lucky I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll only go twice a week. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s also triggering for me to go to the gym sometimes when I see really fit and beautiful people. I just don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know what to do. I read somewhere once that weight loss is mainly diet but with the amount of food they have me eating I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t see how I could ever lose weight. I also eat pretty healthy (I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m vegetarian and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t eat a lot of junk/sweets). So does anyone have any kind of advice or have been through something similar?

I broke up with my first boyfriend over ten years ago, but I still remember the things he said like it was yesterday (same with the others, or just comments I heard being made my men I was attracted to).
 
 It seems like men only seem to see women when they're skinny or underweight. I am also attracted to women, but I've yet to run into a women who made it known she also likes women. Even when I'm a normal BMI, I feel like I'm fat because I'm no longer underweight. I don't know if men just have no idea how bodies should look, or if I'm just deluding and lying to myself.

10j2n73,"I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m seriously considering blocking my sister (who I love dearly) on social media. She lives on the other side of the country and is really bad at responding to text messages, but she spends a ton of time on social media. She is significantly older than I am (16 years to be specific- she likes to point this out to people apparently as a way of showing how ~youthful and ~tiny she is) and has struggled with orthorexia and exercise bulimia since before I was born. Anyway, she likes to post her Apple Watch fitness stats on social media daily, along with her objectively bonkers extreme keto diet plan. I am genuinely trying to recover from AN and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m really tired of the fact that my only regular interaction with her revolves around my seeing how many 1,000s of calories she has burned with her compulsive exercise (one of my last conversations with her before she moved away was essentially her ranting about how hard it is to burn a lot of calories because she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s so thin Ô£ø√º¬¥‚Ä†). She knows about my ED, but does not know that I have relapsed. I feel so awful saying this, but I think she was jealous that I got down to a lower weight than she did, and has been having a hang up about this ever since. I know that if I were to address my concerns for her well being, or about my discomfort with the content of her social media, she would totally implode. She does not take even gentle confrontation well, and Chet‚Äö√Ñ√¥s absolutely hysterical quicker than anyone I have ever met. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s for this reason that I think I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m choosing to mute her on social media and fuck off. 
 
 Anyway, I just felt like ranting and offering a safe space for anyone to bitch about triggering folks in our lives.
