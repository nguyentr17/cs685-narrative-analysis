0,So I've gotten into a huge restrict - binge cycle and I've been purging recently. Today I ended up eating cake since I assisted to 2 birthdays. I feel extremely guilty about it and I try to stick to the thought that everything will be fine and that my body will stay the same since it doesn't really matter that much but I just can't help it but feel guilty and my ED voice keeps telling me bad things. I don't really know how to distract myself from the bad thoughts and I have nothing to do right now.

2,"I’ve struggled with my body image since I was eight, I’m now 14. I’ve also never had the best relationship with food for some reason. Because, I struggle with my body image, I would starve myself, which was pretty easy considering that I didn’t even like eating. I was around 12 when the self starvation began, it was on-and-off behaviour since sometimes I felt pretty good but sometimes I would eat as little as 200 calories per day. 

My sister is really thin. She’s underweight due to her inability to gain weight. I see her wrists, her collarbones, her spine, and I want that. I want to be thin, I want to have thin arms and legs. She is gaining weight and I’m glad to see it, she also struggles with her body image since she wishes she were at a healthy weight. 

My dad would always say I looked ‘full’. I think about it a lot. I remember trying to become fit, in a healthy manner and he said that, and I gave up. He’s been saying it since I was little and I didn’t pay much attention to it because I didn’t care, until I did. 

I’ve never talked to anyone besides two people about my eating issues. I never told my psychiatrist nor my therapist, and I want to, I really do, but I just can’t bring myself to. I know they’ll tell my parents and they’ll make me eat; they’ll pressure me into eating. That is terrifying. The idea of someone watching me eat while making me do it is just not great. I also don’t want to tell them because I don’t want to stress my parents out about me having another mental-health-related issue. I don’t want them to be tired of me and get mad at me.

I got surgery two weeks ago and haven’t eaten much since. I’m always nauseous and I want to throw up. The most calories I’ve had since would probably be 500. I weight myself when I get the chance. I used to be around 98 pounds and now I’m at 90. Ive lost around 8 pounds in the last two weeks. I know it isn’t healthy and I want help, but I can’t bring myself to do it. It’s my fault I got to this point. I should’ve stopped starving myself but I just couldn’t and now I barely know who hunger is. I’m not hungry anymore, all I am is dizzy and nauseous. If I eat properly I want to vomit, I’m just too full. 

I can hardly bring myself to finishing a meal. My mum made chicken with rice today and I ate two bites. I just couldn’t. Ive been in bed the past two weeks and I just can’t think. Theres nothing in my brain. I sleep when I want to eat, and then I wake up without hunger. But I’m tired because I wish I could eat without wanting to throw up, and I wish I wasn’t more terrified of being watched and pressured into eating than a tsunami.",harmful,harmful,harmful,"Negative comments from father about body image, desire to look like underweight sister, fear of being pressured to eat by parents and mental health professionals","Negative comments from father, desire to be thin like sister, fear of being pressured to eat by parents and healthcare providers","Negative comments from dad about body image, seeing sister who is underweight and wanting to be thin like her, fear of being pressured to eat and watched while eating","Struggles with body image and self-starvation since the age of eight, Loss of appetite and nausea after surgery, Inability to eat more than a few bites of food, Difficulty talking to mental health professionals about eating issues, Feelings of guilt and shame about self-starvation","Struggles with body image since the age of eight, Self-starvation and restricting food intake to as little as 200 calories per day, Nausea and difficulty eating after surgery, leading to weight loss, Inability to eat properly due to fear of vomiting and feeling too full","Struggles with body image and self-starvation behavior began at a young age, Reluctance to talk about eating issues with therapist or psychiatrist due to fear of parents finding out and being pressured to eat, Post-surgery, experiencing nausea and difficulty eating, significant weight loss, Cannot bring themselves to finish meals or eat properly due to feeling full and nauseous",nc2cz5,"[0.008895900759013396, 0.00021949775425872468, 0.06838404043488436, 0.09179812583978109, 0.021799225392590934, 0.010216852893330897, 0.00034727824880893474, 0.1628769724217664, 0.18223958601739837, 0.0006561412539867614, 0.06205464341336678, 0.05653804012835573, 0.0005938419462117935, 0.01689215289157225, 0.028387599712030347, 0.1345395485305175, 0.0005351693346954282, 0.03063845271621507, 0.11748523455016563, 0.004901695761049589]",1.0,,Chamomile_tea_bag,,,,,1620975196.0,1.0,,tw: numbers,8,-1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,515.0,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/nc2cz5/i_dont_know/,1.0,2.0,eating_disorders,t5_2zzq8,I don’t know,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/nc2cz5/i_dont_know/

4,"I'm at a very early stage in my recovery (my first appointment with my dietitian was literally last week), and I know that weight gain is inevitable in recovery, but I'm kinda scared of it. Also, I've heard that in anorexia recovery, before weight redistribution happens, most of the weight gain goes to your belly. I feel like this could be really triggering for me, and if that's a necessary step in recovery, then I'll try to make my peace with it, but if there's a way to bypass or avoid it altogether, I'm wondering how this is possible (in a healthy way of course). So I was wondering if it is possible to gain mostly muscle instead of fat in recovery to reduce the amount of belly fat I gain. I'm not looking to become a body builder, nor am I trying to prevent weight gain-- I know that the number on the scale will go up either way, and it needs to in order for me to be healthy, but in one scenario I will find myself a lot more triggered by the appearance of my own body whereas in the other scenario I might be able to make peace with the weight gain because I will see my body growing stronger and more muscular. But then again, maybe this idea of ""fat=bad"" and ""muscle=good"" is just another facet of my eating disorder trying to disguise itself as ""healthy""

7,"Hi! I’m looking for advice. I added a possible trigger warning in case any language I use to describe clothing is triggering. I’m years into recovery and I just noticed that I still can’t wear any tight clothing, specifically tight t-shirts/sweaters. Anything that shows a curve or forms to my body is out. I’m healthy weight, but I still have a hard time wearing tight dresses, shirts, sweaters, and leggings. I can wear tight jeans (although sweatpants/baggy pants are my daily go to). Everyday I still wear baggy clothing and I thought it was a style I liked, but I'm suddenly doubting that.

I just realized today that maybe I don’t feel comfortable wearing tight clothes because of lingering thoughts and beliefs from my ED past. I tried putting on a non-baggy sweater and I immediately took it off because I thought I looked ridiculous. This is really frustrating for me because I thought my body image was improving and now I’m not so sure. Even though I’m mostly happy with my body and weight, I CANNOT bring myself to wear anything remotely tight or form fitting. I'd like to wear more of the clothes that I have and show off my body more.

I just want to get some advice and opinions on what's it like to be hospitalised for anorexia? I saw my GP today and she is worried since my weight has dropped even more from my last visit with her and suggested that I may need to be hospitalised but I really do not want to be. I honestly cannot think of anything worse than that. Can they involuntarily admit me? Or is it something I get the choice to do? If anyone has been hospitalised what is it like in there and what are you forced to do?

He wasn't mean about it, he just said a couple of times without prompting that I could go on a diet if I wanted to as long as I didn't go overboard. We agreed on 120 as a goal weight. Then there was this thing with him making a female friend online that I was uncomfortable with. Mostly because he didn't tell me about it and then inserted a reference to her in a romantic short story he wrote for me when were first married (17 years ago).

17,"I’ve had an unhealthy relationship with food for quite a while now. When I was going to school, I used to skip meals during the day and only eat when I got home in the hope to lose weight. But since the lockdown began and I’ve been at home 24/7 I’ve been forced to eat 3 meals a day (as my parents wouldn’t let me skip). I was already underweight but as I started eating more I started gaining weight. I became really unhappy with my appearance (even though I was still classed as underweight) and so I started trying to be healthier. I started eating less and exercising more. But I still wasn’t satisfied. I started weighing myself regularly and restricting my calories and I wasn’t happy unless I had lost weight. As well as this, I only exercised to compensate for the food I had eaten, not for the actual health benefits. I feel like my mind is constantly consumed with food and calories and it’s making it hard to enjoy the foods I used to love. A few days ago, I calculated my bmi (which I know isn’t always accurate) and it said I am severely underweight. I know that the weight I am at the moment isn’t healthy but I’m really scared to recover. I know that I need to gain weight to get better but a small part of me doesn’t want to. I feel like I’m no longer in control and even if I wanted to stop, I couldn’t.

I have been referred to camhs by my gp around 12 weeks ago because of other mental health issues but still haven’t got an appointment. I want to talk to my parents about a possible eating disorder but I don’t know how to start the conversation and Im scared they won’t understand. I still eat 3 meals a day and don’t look particularly “underweight” so I’m scared they’ll think I’m just overreacting.

18,"I remember being 10 when I became anxious of what I ate. I was 65 pounds and 5 feet tall. People looked at me in fear, concern, sadness. I just didn’t see it-but in a way I did. I hated getting my photo taken. Going to the mall to try on jeans was my nightmare, and holiday dinners were scary. I avoided cameras. Wore clothes that were 4 times my size. Drowning in the fabric to hide my body. People mistaken me for a boy, as I hide under the size 36 jeans. I avoided the happiness and pleasure people sought by sharing meals. It sucked. I was angry about it. I was bitter. I didn’t know why I felt this way, as I saw kids enjoy cake at birthday parties. I was confused when they asked for seconds. Did they realize how many calories were in that? About 300. Did they know that that slice was actually 2.5 servings? Nope. They’re children, why would they know that? Did they know how many grams of fat, carbohydrates, and sugar were in that cake? 22, 36, and 40. And that there was little to no fiber, meaning that cake was going to be stored in that kid for a few hours, and with limited activity before and after that said cake was that those itty bitty grams of fat and sugar were going to multiply and turn into lipids. Those lipids are fat. Fat is bad. Sugar is bad. You’ll be able to see it. In their face, on their arms, their ankles. They won't be a size small anymore, or a double zero. They’ll be miserable, and resentful towards that cake. The sight of cake will be ruined for them endlessly; haunting them in their sleep, when they shower, when they see themselves. They’ll look back at that party as nothing but a regretful and detrimental decision. They will be nothing but the sentiment of that cake. Fat, grotesque, and undesirable. That single piece of cake ruined it all. This was how my brain operated. 

As I grew older, it only became worse, until one night my ballet teacher called my mom and told her I needed to get help. That was the most angriest I’ve been at my mom, driving me through detoured streets getting me to the hospital. It was right after hurricane sandy, and the world seemed apocalyptic. Trees were on the streets, no one had power, and the sense of fear and loss was held by every person. I thought my mother was crazy even thinking about my weight during a tragedy as such, but she was sensing the greatest loss of all. Slowly, she was losing her child. I was dying before her eyes. My heart was failing. “Why can't it be easy?” She probably thought. I was this dubious, angsty, sad kid. I punished myself for the world's mistakes. I was the scapegoat for my family's problems. I had no control, but only over myself. So I decided to just let myself die. She’d look at me, to such disappointment, and I’d run to my room to do push ups. I’d wake up in the middle of the night to go running, I would check my stomach 40 times a day-after every sip and bite of food. My eating disorder turned from just an entity, to becoming me. It was a personality trait of mine. I was being identified with it. I was the one in the family who had an eating disorder, and I was the reason my siblings and friends couldn’t say certain things. I was a burden, and not a person- I felt like I was their problem. 

I felt like I was living the narrative of a Bukowski poem. I hated things. I was so angry. I looked at people enjoying their lunch, and muttered to myself “why can’t I have that”. Why can’t I feel happiness, guiltless, blamelessly, with pure innocent intention when taking a bite of pasta. But there was something greater than that, some finger to point, someone to be held captive-and it was always, invariably me. I chewed my food and spit it out. This became a function of surviving.

There is a lot of shame that is imputed on addicts, anorexics, and bulimics. I was looked at with my disease. People said “I’m sorry” when I told them about it, and it shifted their perception of me. I became this sensitive soul, this hurt being. A fake, artificial niceness to spare me. I didn’t feel like a real person, but a commodity of someone's moral duty. 

“Be nice to the anorexic girl, because in a way you’re saving her.” Fucking bullshit. 

Recovery for anorexics is similar to any substance abuse addict. Relapse is part of the process. Failing is a part of learning-or learning is a part of learning.

I went to rehab. Gained 30 pounds, and felt pretty good about myself. I was able to eat two servings of ice cream at the end of the day, and not question it. Not think poorly of it. Not resent it. It’s not the ice creams fault. I would look at my brother and ask, “should I have more”, and he would give me the sweetest two worded response: why not? It was so uncomplicated. So easy. 

But then I was reminded that I wasn’t easy. I was the youngest, the outcast of my family. I never felt like I looked like any of them. We had different interests, different thoughts of the world. I sparked debate, question, and disagreement. 3 vs 1. I was the lone soldier on the team. A team of only me, and I accepted that and embraced it. I liked being then different one. I wore all black when they wore nothing but color. They had it all together, I was gripping the seams closed. They liked Bruce Springstein, and I liked Black Flag. My sister was girly. I was not. I wanted to live in New York, and I smoked, and did drugs. My brother was always presentable, and my sister always wore makeup. I never wore a bra. My face was always bare. And I was looked at with “skinny” as the first adjective. I looked at baby pictures of me. I never smiled. I looked stern and serious. The tortured artist. 

Being told you’re skinny as a  “functioning anorexic” is the most confusing thing to us. You would think men would say it as if they are sparing you their very last dollar. I was supposed to basq in that. Cry tears of joy. Be astonished, and rewarded. It’s something that they would only say to me when I was naked with them. They seemed uncomfortable when I didn’t react. They were having sex with an anorexic girl. And I think for some of them, it was bothersome. Concern was once again, apparent. I wasn’t desirable at my lowest weight. What more could I do? I sat there, bare and vulnerable and numbed by their fear. I scared people, and that was beginning to scare me.

I think the greatest most impressionable thing that was ever said to me, was that there isn’t a cure for eating disorders. You have it forever. The permanence of anything is daunting. It can seem inextricable, and as if there isn’t a happy ending or light at the end of the tunnel. And some days, and many days, that’s how I feel. I feel ashamed, burdensome, expensive, aggravating towards the ones helping me on this. Am I wasting their money? Am I wasting their time? Am I worth it? But in the moments of uncertainty and hopelessness, I remember that because there is no end, that means there is nothing permanent. These moments will not be forever. And the days where I feel like tearing off my skin, hiding under my blanket, and screaming through my sheets, will turn into warm grassy days at the park. The swelling will subside, and there will be moments when I’ll feel nothing but kisses on my face. I’ll have a piece of cake- no dissection. Just enjoyment, forgivingly celebrating a moment, my progress, music, art, maybe the sun? I’ll celebrate pianos, photos, flowers, and even the color green. ",harmful,neutral,harmful,Developed an eating disorder at a young age and was anxious about what they ate,"Anxiety around food, negative body image, chewing and spitting out food","Developing an eating disorder at a young age, negative self-talk and body image, feeling like a burden to others, being looked at with shame and concern due to the disorder","Hated getting their photo taken and avoided social situations that involved food, Became identified with their eating disorder and felt like a burden to their family, Received shame and pity from others, Went to rehab and gained weight, but still struggled with feeling different from their family and society, Realized that there is no cure for eating disorders and felt shame and uncertainty about their worth","Developed anorexia at a young age and struggled with negative feelings towards food and her body, Felt like a burden to her family and others, Chewed and spit out food as a way of surviving, Received treatment and gained weight, but still struggles with shame and uncertainty","Avoiding social situations and experiences due to anxiety and fear surrounding food, Feeling like a commodity or a sensitive soul instead of a real person, Going through rehab and gaining weight, but still struggling with negative thoughts and feelings of worthlessness, Feeling like there is no hope for a cure and struggling with the permanence of the disorder",g07of7,"[0.001942667384809156, 0.08983587318277257, 0.09946639927438553, 0.1354910051575824, 0.0007461319225297564, 0.004039483675598458, 0.0552463949386315, 0.07699377405915256, 0.016943805437406, 0.011281239547961279, 0.004065736527521414, 0.11682642814585738, 0.061642061660167016, 0.14051508876787405, 0.04114009774832495, 0.0894080590816228, 0.0002115923380470909, 0.0058154829275738965, 0.025981581882604344, 0.022407096339577864]",1.0,,whateveridontcareeeo,,,,,1586735869.0,1.0,,,13,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1383.0,,/r/eating_disorders/comments/g07of7/to_my_anorexic_self/,1.0,10.0,eating_disorders,t5_2zzq8,To my Anorexic Self,https://www.reddit.com/r/eating_disorders/comments/g07of7/to_my_anorexic_self/

Because my dietian has been making me eat 3x more then I was I’ve gained some weight. She told me the weight was temporary but it’s been 2 months now and it’s not going anywhere. It’s making me super depressed and I feel myself wanting to go back into my old ways because it seemed to be working before. I’ve told this to both my therapist and dietian but they always brush it off or when I ask my dietian how can I safely lose weight she just starts talking about how it’s normal for our bodies to change at this age and that we need to learn to accept it. But I can’t accept it. I may not look “fat” to most people but I’m much heavier then I used to be and my goal weight is not under weight it’s just average for my height (right now I feel like I’m on the edge of being average weight/over weight). I’m so frustrated that I can’t get any guidance from them over this. Also I try to work out but because I’m so depressed about my body it takes everything in me to make it to the gym or off the couch after work so if I’m lucky I’ll only go twice a week. It’s also triggering for me to go to the gym sometimes when I see really fit and beautiful people. I just don’t know what to do. I read somewhere once that weight loss is mainly diet but with the amount of food they have me eating I don’t see how I could ever lose weight. I also eat pretty healthy (I’m vegetarian and don’t eat a lot of junk/sweets). So does anyone have any kind of advice or have been through something similar?

21,"I really want to get better and I just wondered if anyone has any tips or anything or ways to distract yourself.

So I'm a 14F and for a couple years I've been more than normally preoccupied with the idea that I was fat and I've always been trying things to lose weight because I was only in the 49/50th percentile for my height ""5'0"" (I'm very small and even though I'm 14 I've basically stopped growing) I tried things like I've always skipped lunch consistently in an effort to lose weight which always made me feel really tired (I barely ate lunch at school in the past two/three years) and rarely I would make myself throw up. I ocassionally skipped lunch and breakfast but I usually just binged on toast by the time I got home anyway. I never really thought of it as a problem I guess bc I never lost anything I just thought of it that it was normal and the most I ever went eating one meal a day was only a couple of days.

That was up until 4 months ago. So, about a month after i started going out with my boyfriend I started to become determined that I would do something about the fact that I was fat because I simply had to lose weight. I don't think this had anything to do with my bf and I'm not entirely sure what triggered it. But I started eating one meal a day in an effort to lose weight... And it worked although ocassionally I would get really hungry and go on binges and a few days I would eat normally. Food became my obsession and it controlled my life I couldn't function properly and I was so... So hungry. I felt so so so trapped like my life would never would get better. But no matter what I wasn't rly skinny enough I mean I think at some point I made it to around the 1st percentile (I don't know what I weigh now it could be more than that bc the scale broke and it probably is more than that) but I wasn't rly thin enough and it became so much more than me being fat because food scared me.

My bf tried his best to support me and he's been the best possible most supportive person ever. And I also have a friend about it who's been supportive but she is dealing with similar shit too.

22,"i’m jam packed with issues, so therapy isn’t exclusive to this particular one. i’m very pro therapy in all aspects. i had a wonderful therapist in the past, whom i saw for several years, and who made a huge impact on my life. i can logically recognize when i need to speak with a professional, and have reached out. my first appointment with this new therapist is this afternoon. (i moved to a new city, and seeing my old therapist is not possible)


currently though, my ED is overwhelming. the anxiety it causes me shoots me into a spiral. i can’t look at myself in the mirror without feeling total fucking disgust. the texts from my mother reading “have you eaten today?” 
“if you say no, i’m ordering you delivery” make me feel like a huge burden. 

despite all of this. all of this anxiety and feeling of sometimes being on the brink of a total meltdown, 

i do not want to change. i don’t want to stop restricting.
i do not want to take steps towards recovery. at this point, it’s not even an option for me. 

so, therapy will be fun.

24,"Good Morning All, Wait, it could be night time for you, but its morning for me:) Anyway, I just graduated college. I apologize for not being as available the past few weeks and month really. My life was rather crazy with finalizing everything to graduate, along with some other personal events. Like, a car accident luckily no one was hurt and I was not cited.

More specifically, I have been working extremely hard to repair the damaged relationships over the course of my binge eating and fitness obsessed phase of my life. It did more damage, than I can show you. Which brings me to this. On Sunday May 21st I am going to start doing some live Periscope sessions. This is a video chat phone app, anyone can tune in. The first one will be a 12pm EST. If you can’t make it no worries, it will be recorded My username is @jahillegas_51

Judging by how it goes, I can add more later on to fit everyone’s crazy schedules and different time zones. Binge eating and “fitness disorders” are something very near and dear to my heart. It gets me really fired up, as you have probably seen. These will be very open. Sometimes, I may have an insight to share with you. Other times it will be simply a Q&amp;A. I am an open book for you. This whole experience has damaged so much, the least I can do is share these lessons to help you.

If you have any questions leading into this event please let me know.

So this can be triggering and I don’t want to hurt anyone, 
I didn’t eat for like 50 hours a few days back and my blood sugars went down to 3 (as to be expected) and a nurse got me to drink some orange juice, they raised to 4.2 and I made it thorough the night. My blood sugars were 3 the next morning so I drunk 25ml of orange juice to keep it stable until I was discharged. My heart rate raised from 40bpm to 128bpm when I went from sitting to standing but I didn’t faint. I think I’m quite durable. When I got home and have been eating around 300 calories for the last few days. I can’t manage going over that, no matter how hard I’m trying. 
I have been very tired but I don’t know if that’s attributed to depression or my eating disorder. I am struggling to stand up, when I do everything goes black and spins around. I just sit back down to reset. 
My hands and feet are constantly cold, this could be due to just a natural difficulty with thermoregulation due to autism. 
When I was trying to get to sleep last night I could see my heart beating through my chest, this really freaked me the hell out. This could be normal, I genuinely don’t know but I have never seen it before.

32,"Ive been diagnosed by different doctors with plenty of their own opinions. It started with a bulemia diagnosis and then ANA and then binge purge subtype and EDNOS. I used to restrict and when I got malnourished enough I'd have uncontrollable binge episodes followed by purging. One of my tools for recovery had been stopping restricting entirely. That has been really helpful. I've also had to address how food is an addiction to me. Why I eat certain foods rather than things that are actually good for me. Its been a long painful journey along side having parents who are addicts to other more damaging substances.

34,"I’m seriously considering blocking my sister (who I love dearly) on social media. She lives on the other side of the country and is really bad at responding to text messages, but she spends a ton of time on social media. She is significantly older than I am (16 years to be specific- she likes to point this out to people apparently as a way of showing how ~youthful and ~tiny she is) and has struggled with orthorexia and exercise bulimia since before I was born. Anyway, she likes to post her Apple Watch fitness stats on social media daily, along with her objectively bonkers extreme keto diet plan. I am genuinely trying to recover from AN and I’m really tired of the fact that my only regular interaction with her revolves around my seeing how many 1,000s of calories she has burned with her compulsive exercise (one of my last conversations with her before she moved away was essentially her ranting about how hard it is to burn a lot of calories because she’s so thin 🫠). She knows about my ED, but does not know that I have relapsed. I feel so awful saying this, but I think she was jealous that I got down to a lower weight than she did, and has been having a hang up about this ever since. I know that if I were to address my concerns for her well being, or about my discomfort with the content of her social media, she would totally implode. She does not take even gentle confrontation well, and Chet’s absolutely hysterical quicker than anyone I have ever met. It’s for this reason that I think I’m choosing to mute her on social media and fuck off.

37,"It usually occurs when I've fasted for too long. I'm dead exhausted but simultaneously eager to cook for my sister. Like I have too much brain fog to do anything else but just enough gone to be a chef.  I'll just go into her room, offer to prepare something, and if she says yes, then I'll suggest what I'm craving at the moment. We have similar tastes. And then I'll suggest side A or side B, and then another side C or side D. I don't force her to overeat, or at least I think I don't because I try not to. And then I'll obsess over making it look restaurant quality.   


Examples below (TLDR: perfect finger food, cookies/milk, and spaghetti)

&amp;#x200B;

* One day she simply agreed with a corndog and fries, so I spent a good minute finding a *very* specific and good-looking plate that would fit everything *perfectly*, and folding paper towels into triangles to tuck behind the corndogs, and adding the condiments in a near-perfect zigzag, and wrapping extra silverware in a paper towel, and finding a straw for an iced drink. 
* Another day I heard she made honor roll, so I felt like congratulating her with her favorite brand of cookies because I was craving them, so I put them flat on a plate, under a paper towel, and made an iced strawberry milk. Included the milk because it's rare to make it.
* Another day I made spaghetti, with the garnish and shredded cheese and 3 perfectly placed meatballs. Added this because I never make spaghetti, and I haven't made spaghetti since.

Weird thing is I'll completely avoid the food. When it's an average day and I'm making something, and I allow myself to, I'll usually have bites as I make it. On these days, I'm just intensely staring at the pan/oven/etc as I make it, and I *hover* over my sister as I ask for her approval. And hearing her praise makes me feel full. Watching her take the first bite and be happy feels like I've eaten the whole meal. And then I go back to my room and rot away waiting for the slow ass fast to end, or just go and offer to cook during the next meal window.",,,,,,,,,,10go05e,"[0.001186154411729006, 0.2336590401504747, 0.016090504503019566, 0.076360071939996, 0.08357961573382233, 0.028236330883880334, 0.0004424210740237394, 0.040075551777388654, 0.13577140029623372, 0.02112976388830905, 0.00802706074347934, 0.011146020236872509, 0.12251970410770358, 0.0012261860446052988, 0.010797542066600425, 0.1511051010448782, 0.010828718890478446, 0.0035181240599203058, 0.017762227366710563, 0.026538460779874172]",1.0,,royceriel,,,,,1674190880.0,1.0,,story time,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,380.0,,/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10go05e/dae_eat_through_others/,1.0,1.0,EDAnonymous,t5_rbmui,DAE eat through others?,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/10go05e/dae_eat_through_others/

Also, my period is still missing despite taking progesterone and eating a lot.

45,"I (27f) have been married to my partner for a few months. We've known each other for 9 years, and have now been married a few months. There's a whole fucking ton to the story between meeting and here, but he is the best relationship I've ever had. He makes me feel loved, cared for, and beautiful. Sure there are rocky moments, but everyday I look forward to seeing him. To every moment spent together even if it's spent in silence, or even in times of relationship difficulties. I never even believed that a love like this could even be real.   Recently I have been really trying to push past the stagnant ""quasi-recovery"" I've been in for ages because I want the best for our future. I actually care about the future now. It's wild.  I have now hit a goal of being around X lbs after a long time of trying to get here. It's still underweight, but significantly closer to a ""healthy"" weight than I have generally been. I have only managed to hit this weight once since I was 16, and that was only maintained for about a month after 5ish months of IP/RTC.  Basically,  I almost feel like I'm going through puberty again. It's hard to make sense of the changes in my body, but I am doing my best to push through.   My husband has praised me for my efforts, which I do appreciate. However, he also makes comments about my body changes/weight gain/etc. I have asked him to be extremely cautious, especially right now (I feel so fragile in trying to stay this course), in commenting on my body. Specifically I've asked him to refrain from commenting on weight gain, being heavier, whatever. For the most part, he's done quite well. And I appreciate that so much.   Yet when he's tired or had a bit to drink, sometimes he' l  go off about my body. And in his mind, it's positive. And I know I should view it as positive, too. But he'll grab my ribs, or my hip bones, or whatever and comment on the changes. And I know he's trying to tell me how beautiful he thinks I am and how proud he is of my progress. But all my brain does is screech.   I'm not mad or upset with him in any way. Mainly this is just a vent, though if anyone does have advice, I wouldn't mind.

I struggle with bipolar 2 disorder and mental illness and fell into a really bad episode last year and starved myself for months. I gained some weight back and I hate myself so much, I bury myself in oversized clothes and sob in the mirror at the sight of myself. I have bad body dysmorphia because everyone around me assures me I don’t look different from before.   Instead of throwing up, I have an addiction with overusing laxative pills. If I eat too much, I take an ungodly amount of overnight laxative pills and release in the most painful, extreme way. Taking those pills constantly is so bad for you and I know that, but it makes me feel cleansed and like the food escaped my body. I’m going to be honest, I wish I could just throw it up since the stomach pains I get from the laxatives is so bad, but I’ve only thrown up a few times in my life and hated it, so I avoided trying.   I am obsessed with how I look and every pound. I don’t eat, I starve myself completely some days. Today I drank 10 bottles of water and ate only saltine crackers. It’s easy for me to starve because I know how to lose the weight fast. This is unhealthy and I recognize that, but I don’t know what to do. I also don’t know if this qualifies as bulimic/anorexia since I’m not throwing up, but I thought this thread would most understanding. I’m tired of every thought I have being about my weight.

I've upped my calories to about 1000, haven't weighed myself but am still very bloated &amp; feel pretty nasty. I reckon that may be down to a large consumption of vegetables...  But anyway, husband is taking us (myself &amp; our daughter) out for gelato today. The menu of this place is terrifying. ""Sky scraper sundae"", ""Loaded Belgian waffle"" that sort of thing. I get that it's a ""treat"" or it's supposed to be. This is no treat for me. They don't provide nutrition or calorie information &amp; I hate that.   The problem lies in that sure, I could use all my calories on an ice cream sundae. But then I can't eat anything else. &amp; I'm trying to eat more regularly &amp; up the calories slowly, not have one big calorie bomb.  Looking at the menu I see they do scoops of gelato in a cup. So I thought, I'll have a scoop of that. Husband insists I'm going to have 2 scoops. Okay, fine. But then can I still have my salad &amp; yogurt at dinner? Or will I be way over? *I don't know because they don't have calorie information*. It's just really frustrating me.

I purge maybe once or twice a week these days &amp; have suddenly begun to clench my jaw &amp; teeth in my sleep.

55,"tl;dr it's a rollercoaster, but I thought if someone could use some insight, I should post maybe?  I started recovery around 6 months ago, but relapsed after 3 weeks, and then came back to it in late October. What made me come back to recovery, was when my best friends sat down with me, and told me they didn't think they could sit down and watch me die anymore, and that it was becoming too much for them. So on the day they told me that, I started actual recovery.  I had extreme hunger for a few weeks, and still sometimes now. I didn't run nor exercise beforehand, and so after a month, my aunt offered me to go to the gym with her. I also started craving a bunch of meats, so I naturally ate a bunch of protein out of nowhere. I started gaining muscle, and I can see I have gained so much muscle back, and yes, I also gained weight along with all this. The weight gain came super fast sometimes, and then would slow down, then go back to fast, then slow down. It's still kind of like that, but now it's up and down, but I honestly don't even weigh myself as often anymore, because it's starting to become irrelevant (VERY SLOWLY). My extreme hunger varies, I still have it on certain days of the week, and certain days it's ALMOST normal, until it hits a certain time sometimes. I will say, to people worried about huge amounts of weight gain very fast, I gained super fast within a week, and I had a massive anxiety attack, almost relapsed. In my experience, that weight isn't real weight, and it's just your body processing it.  Honestly, I have had really tough moments, but I feel so much better and stronger now. I thought going to the gym would make me relapse, or restrict, but I ate even more because I felt more hungry, and I didn't feel bad. I don't feel lightheaded anymore, I can eat out, and I can be happy with my friends again, without feeling like they're worried about me. My advice, is be patient, and don't let yourself scare the living hell out of your recovery. I still have a long way to go, but I thought I would share my experience so far.  &amp;#x200B;  (Edit: I should also say, I haven't done cardio for 4 months, and I FEEL AMAZING)",helpful,helpful,helpful,"Support from best friends, going to the gym, eating more protein","Supportive friends who expressed concern for the person’s well-being, extreme hunger, going to the gym and gaining muscle, fluctuating weight gain, and patience with the recovery process","Getting support from best friends who were concerned about the writer's health, starting to crave more protein and gaining muscle, going to the gym","Started recovery after being confronted by best friends, Experienced extreme hunger and gained weight and muscle, Had tough moments but feels better and stronger now, Going to the gym did not cause a relapse or restriction, and instead helped with hunger, Feels more energetic and can eat out and be happy with friends","Became motivated to start recovery after friends expressed concern, Experienced extreme hunger and cravings for protein, Started going to the gym and gained muscle, Experienced fluctuating weight gain, which caused anxiety but eventually became less significant, Feeling better and stronger, able to eat out and be happy with friends again","Experiencing extreme hunger and weight gain that varied in speed, Realizing that fast weight gain was just the body processing food, Feeling better and stronger, not feeling lightheaded anymore, and being able to eat out and enjoy time with friends",lb8klx,"[0.0011234564219096675, 0.00026485203042051305, 0.010434698245853675, 0.05790794246546622, 0.02149825411355372, 0.0940178848117701, 0.0004190354914042157, 0.009125483462377938, 0.13820535038783105, 0.03442875590129852, 0.15176149820833976, 0.000946279413661171, 0.010327128264640679, 0.0011613720546381628, 0.0006162211730002182, 0.19117086820482085, 0.0006457500460155406, 0.14268560469651637, 0.06968155023038636, 0.0635780143760952]",1.0,,FrancineUrgot,,,,,1612305177.0,1.0,,recovery story,15,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,410.0,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/lb8klx/how_my_4_months_of_recovery_has_been/,1.0,26.0,AnorexiaRecovery,t5_o3plh,How my 4 months of recovery has been,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/lb8klx/how_my_4_months_of_recovery_has_been/
56,"I’m not nowhere near fully recovered, so this might not be the complete accurate way of dealing with the judgement, or fear of it.   I wanted to say, the main reason I never wanted to gain, even though people would always tell me “you looked so good when you weighed more”. I always thought my friends wouldn’t like me as much if I wasn’t this skinny fragile person. Of course it’s your eating disorder saying this to you, convincing you the whole world revolves around liking you for being this way, or might be something similar.   I know everyone always says to just “ignore the thoughts”. It’s not easy, it’s a constant war waging in your head, all the time. I never have liked my body, never. Even at my thinnest, even at my “normal”, or in my bigger body, I never liked it. I guess I just convinced myself that, no matter what, I’ll never find love, or happiness with someone, no matter what body I have. That’s totally not true, of course that’s something I told myself. But it got to the point to where, I was miserable, everyday. I was punishing myself, and living for everyone else BESIDES me. I really put my body through so much, just in case it made me look more attractive by being thin.   I think in the short way, living your life for everyone else in the world besides you, isn’t the way to live life. Constantly battling with yourself over your own natural instincts isn’t a way to live life. It’s something we have to eventually come to terms with, but once you realize how much time you spent worrying about what everyone thinks, rather than just living, you’ll have so many emotions.

59,"So I've been recovering for 3 years. But it's only really been the last year (just under) that I've been gaining weight.  At first I was scared of getting fat but now it's completely different.  It's the opposite of my old anorexic thoughts but they are just as destructive and drive me insane.  I'm constantly feeling like I have a masculine body, that I don't look feminine enough. I have tiny boobs and hardly any hip or bum.  I'm like a rectangle and I beat myself up for it everyday.   When I was seeing consistent weight gain I was feeling great and never felt bad about my body. But now weight gain has slowed down I'm feeling so bad about myself.   Always thinking I need bigger boobs. I need to be curvier.   I'm always telling myself I look like a boy, my face is too masculine, my body is too masculine.   Some days I can barely look at myself because I don't feel womanly enough.  I really think it's body dismorphia but the opposite of what I'm used to because I'm always told I have a long oval face.  But when I look in the mirror I see a short square face with a very wide jaw bone. I see masculine features where others don't get what I see.   I've never heard anyone talk about recovery in this light so I just don't know if I'm alone.

61,"In fact I think my ED might have become a coping mechanism to deal with the loneliness it created. I haven’t had any friends in over 8 years (not even acquaintances) and at my age, it often feels difficult to start anew considering the only social spaces left are either bars, volunteerism, or work but even with that, I forgot how to socialize since I no longer feel like I have a personality at times.   Idk if I’m rambling but sometimes the loneliness makes me feel pathetic and slightly miss my ED as it was some masochistic companion I had to hold on to. Without it, some days I feel even more boring to myself since my thoughts no longer revolve around food and calories anymore. So how do you cope with the loneliness or what have you done to “put yourself out there” and reconnect to the world?

64,"   t I went to an eating disorder treatment center a few years ago and they used DBT almost exclusively (which has been my only exposure to DBT). It was a really horrible experience that caused me to get worse in the long run instead of better. Mostly this is because they take an approach of treat the ED first and any co-occurring issues can be treated later in outpatient. My personal diagnoses are PTSD and anorexia. My trauma history involves severe abuse including sex trafficking by a parent. Stepping into a facility where I was locked in and lost all autonomy and privacy was extremely triggering. Instead of helping me through it, they ignored what was happening for me and literally allowed me to drown in the flashbacks.  My biggest issues with DBT as a whole:  * coping skills felt very basic and unhelpful. I had already learned these things either on my own or in previous therapy, it just gave a name for the skills. * The coping skills really weren't effective or helpful in what I was dealing with. It was like being given a glass of water to put out a forest fire. * Not having the space to talk about my trauma history meant that some really insensitive things were said that I doubt anyone would actually say to another person if they knew that person's history. I tried not to take it personally, but it really did hurt a lot and cause me to withdraw even more. It meant that my behaviors and triggers didn't really make sense to my therapist because she lacked the context of what I have been through. I often felt shamed for PTSD symptoms, couldn't be open about what was happening for me, and often times behaviors were mis-attributed as ED symptoms. For example, my therapist asked if I was having a lot of panic attacks. I was. She asked if any of the staff was noticing it because I have a tendency to withdraw and get quiet when I'm struggling. They weren't. She told me to tell them when they were occurring so that it would get documented. She said that having this would help them get insurance to cover a longer stay. But my panic attacks weren't about my ED, they were due to flashbacks and a lot of parallels between my abuse and the treatment environment. They weren't treating my PTSD, so how would keeping me longer help? Looking back, I think a lot of this type thing was occurring--where me struggling was seen as oh she's crying because she thinks she's fat, and not actually realizing I was in PTSD hell.  Issues with my therapist:  * She was very confrontational. I would try to bring up something that was really bothering me. She would immediately tell me why I was wrong or that my emotions were wrong, she's then square her shoulders back and sit up straight. I'd shut down and retreat from the conversation. * I felt minimized and dismissed. It definitely felt very cold, indifferent, and unsupportive. I didn't feel empowered in the recovery process, but instead that all agency was stripped from me and my voice ignored. It felt very much like an us-against-them approach, and nobody ever stopped fighting against me long enough to recognize I wasn't fighting back. * She tried to get me to call my brother when I learned that he was in heart failure. My brother is very close to my father, and genuinely it's not at all safe. When I was resistant, she looked at me incredulously and said, ""You don't actually *think* that your dad is going to come after you if you contact your brother do you???"" Seriously, yes. Yes, I do. I didn't run away in the middle of the night and cut off all contact with anyone who has any sort of ties with my dad for zero reason. I've seen my dad's violence. He also told me exactly what he would do to me if I ever tried to leave. It was sooooo hurtful. So minimizing. And made me feel incredibly alone and misunderstood. * She once told me, ""All you do is go back to the bad things that happened to you. You go back to what happened as a kid, during college, or right after college. You never focus on the present."" One. She had my timeline completely off. The last time my father sexually abused me, I was 27. The abuse didn't stop because I grew up, it got worse instead. I wasn't going back over the abuse because I like the discussion topic, I was literally in the middle of trying to figure out why I was being triggered by something that had happened earlier that day. For me, the easiest way to identify triggers is to go, ""Okay, what am I feeling? What does this remind me of? When was the last time I felt like this?"". Also, too, the only prior therapy experience I had, had been psychodynamic, so I was doing what I would normally do in therapy and what helped me. She never explained the difference in modalities, etc. What did happen is that I felt like I was being shamed for having flashbacks and not being able to keep the ptsd under control on my own. * Before moving down to PHP she told me that if I self-harmed once or lost a single pound while on PHP she would have me put in a psych ward. The absolute LAST thing I needed was to be told I had to be perfect. I needed, ""You're gonna mess up, and that is okay. PHP is a learning curve and we will get through it together."" The result? It shut down any ability to reach out for support when I needed it. I didn't stop self-harming, I just moved my self-harm to where it wouldn't be seen during skin checks. I didn't get every meal down like I was supposed to, I bought a scale and water loaded in the mornings before weigh in. This is the only point in my recovery where I have been dishonest with anyone in my team. But it wasn't safe to be honest. * I used to love running before I relapsed. When I stopped running, it was because I knew that if I couldn't fuel myself properly. One of my recovery goals was to get back to running when I knew I was healthy enough for it. My therapist called my husband in front of me and told him that I was to never run again. No running, no swimming, nothing where it involved laps, or I could time myself. I felt like she had thrown me under the bus. Exercise has never been part of my ED, so I felt it really out of line and not helpful to say that. Mostly, I felt betrayed by her. * She changed my outpatient therapist without telling me in advance. I found out a couple weeks before leaving treatment when they were giving me my appointment times. I had been doing trauma therapy for two years with the same provider, and felt like if they wanted to change my therapist, I needed to know about it ahead of time and have time and the space in therapy to process the end of that relationship. My therapist wanted someone who specialized in eating disorders and thought my therapist should have forced me into treatment. The ED therapist she assigned me to was an hour drive from my home. I cancelled the appointment when I got home and called my old therapist back.  There is more, I know there is more, but that is all I can bring to the table right now. Are these types of dynamics what DBT is supposed to look like? Are all the coping tools so basic and ineffective? Was it not helpful because it's geared towards BPD and not PTSD? Or did I get a watered down version with a horrible therapist? I refuse to say she was a bad fit--I will continue to believe that she was a horrible therapist and would be a bad fit for anyone, even if I'm wrong.

65,"in a world where we’re all constantly surrounded by beauty standards, weight is the one thing that has always stuck out to me. Of all the things society sees as beautiful in a standardized way, eyes, lips, bone structure, height, skin tone etc. weight is the only one i can actually “control”. When i speak up about how much i actually compare myself to others, i’m told to just “accept myself for who i am” which i HAVE and no one seems to understand me. I have, indeed, accepted myself for all of the traits that i cannot control. But for my weight, i can never stop comparing myself to people thinner than me because i know i can always work harder to lose more weight. How can i accept my weight as being part of “me” when it is able to be changed?

68,"Hi everyone, I have been in recovery for quite some time now but soon I’m turning 18. I’ve always wanted to be a pescatarian and go dairy free because I took a nutrition class in high school and we learned about how cows and chickens are raised before they are killed and sent to stores as food. It made me sad and grossed out, however,  I don’t feel this way about fish because my family often catch and cook our own fish, and in my eyes, that’s not bad for the environment. I want to go dairy free to improve my acne and since dairy usually upsets my stomach.   However, my doctor has refused to let me go pescatarian or dairy free because she believes I need the protein in cows milk and animal products to recovery properly. My parents have also not let me because up till now I’ve been a child and not allowed to make my own decisions. They also say that it’s restrictive.   I know being pescatarian will give me a better relationship with food and my body, I know once I’m 18 no one can force me to eat what I don’t want to, however, I am afraid my parents will judge me and not be supportive.

70,"Today would have been Day 3 but I lost my footing tonight. Here's a timeline with what I ate:   \- Made myself a big salad for meal #4 (I like to eat 5 smaller, healthy meals a day). This is when the urges began.   \- Tried to distract myself by taking dog for a walk. Walked for 35 minutes. Success!  \-Came back and decided to make myself a protein crunch wrap (it's basically flavored protein powder mixed with water, wrapped in a tortilla and popped into the oven to make a crunchy wrap). I'm a bodybuilder so I have all these protein food recipes I love. The wrap is only 270 calories, delicious and fits my macros so I don't feel to bad about it.   \- Then I think to myself....ah, I really want something else. That wrap was only 270 calories. I have room for more (I don't). I make myself a vegan mug cake with greek yogurt frosting, strawberries and walden farms syrup.  \- I'm definitely full after the mug cake. But I really want another mug cake. So I make one more with greek yogurt frosting and diced strawberries and syrup.  \-After the second mug cake I'm stuffed. I force myself to go sit down and try and focus on a project I'm working on. But I want more food. I like eating while I'm working on projects. I get about three minutes into my project when I stand back up and walk into the kitchen, almost like in auto-pilot mode.   \-I eat a few cashews from the jar. A bunch of pumpkin puree mixed wth pb2. I go sit back down.  \-About ten minutes goes by and I'm feigning. I tell myself it's the last weekend I'll have the house to myself (fiance is out of town), plus I'm on my period (TMI? Oh well, time to grow up), so I deserve a get-out-of-jail-free card for tonight. Then I think about how shitty I'll feel in the morning. Then I remind myself it's the last weekend I'm home alone. I get back up.  \-I eat one of those jumbo flour tortillas - 310 calories each. I eat it slow, piece by piece, mesmerized by its texture. That shit is so fucking bomb. At this point I contemplate driving to the store to buy a box a cereal to binge on. No, don't do it, I tell myself. You'll REALLY feel like shit in the morning if you do that. Then I think about ho ho's and a bavarian cream filled donut. And the really really bottom of the barrel junk food.   \-I make a compromise with myself: instead of cereal or donuts, I decide on two massive bowls of oatmeal mixed with PB2, almond milk, and bananas. I think to myself....I'll wake up feeling kind of crappy, which is better than REALLY REALLY DEPRESSED and shitty from eating  bottom of the barrel junk food.  &amp;#x200B;  I think my binge is over. It could have definitely been a lot worse, and I think if I can stay stopped then I won't wake up feeling like hell like all last week when I ate donuts and cupcakes and cake and little debbie treats.

71,"A few years ago, I woke up feeling extra shitty - **defeated, hopeless, sick to my stomach** \- from a particularly horrible evening of drinking. **I felt so out of control** with alcohol and my life.  Every morning I woke up terrified that I would drink, and every night I would drink, and drink way too much (because once I broke the seal, **I got the fuck its, numbed out, and went full hog**). **I was so sick of promising myself I would quit** drinking, only to break my promise and fail myself - over and over and over. I didn't believe myself at all, and my promises felt emptier and emptier with each passing day, which terrified me more and more because -- **if you can't trust the one and only mind and body you inhabit, then what CAN you trust? It's a scary place to be.**  &amp;#x200B;  I was so sick of myself. I hated myself. And it's hard to feel motivated to change and improve for someone you don't respect.  &amp;#x200B;  As I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I wondered how the hell I got to that point. I reflected back on my life, and thought back to when I was just a little girl. I saw myself at about 7 years old, running around the park, playing in the sand, just being a kid with her entire life ahead of her. So much hope, so much to live for. What did she want in life? What were her hopes and dreams? Tears started streaming down my face, because even though I hated the person I was in that moment, I realized I still loved that little girl, and I still wanted to make her hopes and dreams come true. I couldn't do it for myself, but I could do it for her.  &amp;#x200B;  And right then and there, I sat up in bed, sobbing, and decided......**I'm going to do this. I'm going to do it for her.**  &amp;#x200B;  And I linked both my pinkies together, because that's what kids do...right? And I pinky promised myself that I would never, ever give up, that I would **keep trying something new, something different,** until I finally found something clicked.  &amp;#x200B;  And for the first time in months, after all the empty promises, after losing faith in my own word, I actually believed myself. I realized....  maybe I can't promise myself that I'll stop drinking today, because that still feels so out of my control, but I can promise myself that **I will keep trying new things.** That I will not give up. Even if I fall back down, the promise can still hold true, because **it's not contingent on my success/failure,** only on my effort.  &amp;#x200B;  When I made that promise to myself, I meant it.  &amp;#x200B;  Did I stop drinking that day? No. But **I started making real progress, started putting together new puzzle pieces, and I started having real faith that I was going to find something that stuck.**  &amp;#x200B;  Today, I am almost two years sober.  &amp;#x200B;  Why am I writing about this?  &amp;#x200B;  Because I'm struggling with binge-eating now. And it's been painful. All those emotions I struggled with while I trying to quit drinking, the cycle, the relapses, the waking up hopeless and defeated, it's all back, only now it's with food.  &amp;#x200B;  But this time, I KNOW for CERTAIN that I will find something that clicks for me, that I will overcome this. Because I did it with alcohol. And I can do it with food. And so can you.  &amp;#x200B;  **The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. This is why we have to keep trying new things, because what works for one person won't work for the next.** We are all individuals with unique stories and motivations and backgrounds, so that is why we have to keep trudging forward, paying attention to every setback so we can learn for the next round.  &amp;#x200B;  **So let's make a pact,** guys. Let's freaking do this. Maybe we'll binge again, maybe we won't. But what we CAN be certain of is that we'll get back up. We'll FACE what happened, so we can learn from it. We'll try something different, so we can figuring out new tools and strategies.  &amp;#x200B;  **We're in this TOGETHER!**  &amp;#x200B;  And every time we try something new, let's share it on here so we can keep helping each other out, and motivating each other.  &amp;#x200B;  Who's in? Pinky promise?  &amp;#x200B;  Here are a few new things I have been trying:  1. I have been listening to a new podcast that has been really comforting. It's called ""Healing Emotional Eating"" by Janet D Thomas. Even though it's about emotional eating, it totally applies to binge-eating. 2. I have been trying shift my focus from what I want, rather than on what I don't want. So instead of being like.."" I don't want to binge, I don't want to eat that, I don't want to do this, or that."" I am thinking ""I want to eat bomb, healthy foods that make me feel amazeballs, I'm a badass who is free from the chains of food, I want to wake up without bloat belly tomorrow, I want to go to bed feeling good."" I feel like focusing on what I don't want still gives it power and energy. I want to shift that energy and power to the things I want so I feel motivated to chase them. It also helps squash that ""voice"" that tells me to binge. 3. Meditation. I have found some food freedom meditations on YouTube, and am trying them out in the mornings. I used to think meditation was so hokey, but I got so desperate when I was trying to quit drinking that I tried it - mainly because my brain felt so effed up I knew I needed some mental clarity. Well goddamn,....that shit actually helped A LOT!!! 4. When I want to eat something when I'm not hungry, I play the video reel all the way through to the end. I think to myself....ok, so you eat the donut. Where are you going to be in five minutes? Exactly where you are right now, because it's not like the donut is going to be in your mouth forever (though that would be nice, wouldn't it, lol. Note to self: invent the eternal donut).

You can see the tattoo in my post history, it’s the most recent post. It says, “beyond fear lies freedom”.   Getting this tattoo has helped me further commit to recovery.

I know I will inevitably face challenges and likely more disordered eating, but this tattoo reminds me that I never want to get as bad as I did.   This tattoo isn’t just for my recovery from anorexia but everything that has happened in my life in the past two years. Before I was robbed at gunpoint, thus developing severe PTSD, I was fearless in everything that I did. The robbery completely took that away from me. Then I discovered my boyfriend at the time was a porn addict that was exclusively attracted to underage girls, which made my anorexia so much worse since I always compared myself to underdeveloped 12 year old girls. Our relationship was so toxic and it instilled so much fear in me in so many aspects.   One year since we broke up and since I decided to commit to recovery, and I can say I actually feel somewhat okay for first time in years now.   I’ve been through hell and back and I never thought that reaching the place I have in recovery would be possible. But it was, and I am thankful. I am thankful that I let go of him. I am thankful we separated. I am thankful I chose to recover. If I didn’t, I would have been dead by March of last year.

Tbh I didn't even realize how little I was eating because for the first time in a while I wasn't tracking anything. I just felt way to damn tired and cyncial to do it. I had a nothing matters mindset and just wallowed, sometimes I ate a little of dinner, but after realizing how much I was eating (and how much less it is than I usually eat) I've stopped eating entirely and decided to just take advantage of it instead.  I couldn't use to go days without eating cause I usually binge when I heavily restrict or try fasting, but weirdly enough I haven't ate anything for maybe a few days now. I have not been keeping track.  I feel like shit and probably look like it, but I also feel happy cause it feels like I have a lot of control and it's the one thing I'm doing right. Basically, it's a good distraction and I'm leaning into it. It's either this or sh and I can't do that.

83,"TW: mentions of diets, eating behaviours, swearing.  So I just randomly got a few flashbacks of how people responded to me opening up about my anorexia back when I was so deep up in it and I just can NOT believe how blinded people are by diet culture. They literally tried to “help” me by proposing DIET SHIT ALTERNATIVES instead of telling me I didn’t even need to lose weight to begin with. Now I don’t know about you, but those things were the LAST things I needed to hear and I don’t think anyone struggling with anorexia should be offered ways to perpetuate this form of self-harm only in “safer” and socially more accepted ways. Some of you may tell me: “yeah well most people don’t know how to respond to eating disorders” / “they were just trying to help” and I agree to an extent. But I am so angry that I didn’t even recognise that they were participating in perpetuating my self-hatred and spiral down anorexic behaviours and glorification.   I often read on the internet that ‘diet culture is everywhere’ and now I finally understand. Telling an anorexic about YOUR diet routine and ways you approach it IS NOT the right answer to someone literally disappearing physically and mentally from themselves. Telling an anorexic that they didn’t even “EAT THAT MUCH” is NOT the right answer either.   Society and media have made it ‘normal’ and totally acceptable to TRACK DOWN one’s food intake, set unhealthy fitness goals and push one’s self to look like someone they are not.   Well, I don’t know about you guys, but personally speaking, it drives me fucking insane. So here, I’ll say it to my past self and to whoever needs to hear this / agrees with me: TRACKING YOUR FOOD INTAKE, BEING OBSESSIVELY MINDFUL OF YOUR BODY AND LOOKS, RESTRICTING, ‘INTERMITTENT FASTING’ (which is but another name for starvation), BANNING FOODS, SKIPPING MEALS and so on and so forth IS NOT NORMAL.   You wanna know what’s normal? You wanna know what YOU deserve?? You deserve to live your life FULLY, UNBOTHERED by such a NATURAL AND ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO SURVIVE ACT AS EATING. You deserve to ENJOY your food, YES EVEN THE ONES THAT ARE NOT ‘HEALTHY’. You deserve to ANSWER AND HONOR your hunger cues (WHETHER THEY ARE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL). You deserve to TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEALTH but always REASONABLY and not obsessively and destructively.   Your body is the way that it is for so many fucking reasons. Thinking you should look a certain way is literally the most deranged thing society has ever succeeded to make us believe. Thinking you should eat a certain way and amount is fucking dumb as well. Jesus Christ we are talking about FOOD. The second thing that keeps us alive after water. Don’t you think it’s much better if you can enjoy it??? ALLOW YOURSELF. ALLOW IT ALL.  And for all those people who thought they were helping but were just reflecting back my insecurities and diet culture: FUCK YOU. Fuck you. Fuck you. And I’m sorry you are so fucking blind you literally perpetuated deadly shit on someone because you thought you were helping. This is just about how dangerous diet culture is.

84,"I think some people are just need to be a higher weight than others to be healthy. No I dont meant it's bc they have more muscle, they have larger bones, bla bla. I meant they literally need to be fatter, they literally need to be a higher bf%, to be healthy. I dont care anymore if some 15 year old named suzie think that's fat logic.       A little backstory- in puberty, i was always the teen version of a lower but healthy bmi (teenagers dont use bmi, they use percentile, but you get what i mean). I was always in the ""acceptable"" range at school physicals. I never tripped any alarms. I was as skinny as most other students. But I was the one who, in order to maintain that weight, was passing out twice a month, not them. I was the one having a snack as my lunch, skipping my periods here and there, failing to grow in height or chest size. Not them.       It doesn't help that my sister in her teenage years could be literally off-the-charts underweight and still show no signs of disordered eating, still have a fully functional life, never pass out, no medical issues, always getting her period, etc. My mom loved talking about how she was a similar weight as a teenager, and spoke of my sister taking after her like a point of pride.       I felt like even more of a failure bc I have very tiny bones and almost no muscle so I never felt like I could blame bone or muscle for my failure to be naturally skinny.       Anyway, very unsurprisingly, I eventually lapsed into a full-blown ED. When I hit my LW, I started mysteriously gaining on very few cals a day. I had triggered FHA. Even my endo noted that it was an uncommon condition. I once again compared myself- why could so many people be so much skinnier without triggering FHA? I actually lost weight very slowly and relatively little of it, so why me?       I started weight restoration. I was partially weight restored when I stopped that in its tracks. I had reached a bmi that most young people here have. But it just wasn't meant to be. I still needed to constantly use ED behaviours to maintain that weight. I was still mentally a wreck and obsessed with food. I felt like a crazy person stuck in a normal person's body, which felt more confusing than a crazy person stuck in an anorexic body.       Yesterday, I had a realization- if I needed to constantly pass out and stunt my own growth to be normal-slim as a teenager, maybe it just isnt meant to be.       It helps me to think of being naturally skinny like being naturally good at basketball. Some people are just not meant for it. It makes no sense for a 5 foot tall person to aim for the NBA and be constantly envious of natural talents.       Today I stopped all ED habits. I just ate intuitively. I know I will gain weight but I'm reminding myself of the basketball analogy. I feel bad when I see so many naturally skinny people on the streets and know I can't be one of them, but I remind myself that I am good at other things. Because today, I could finally focus on pursuits I was always good at without struggling to put my food obsession in the backdrop.

85,"Good day,  I'm a teen male (age 17) in recovery from a binge sub-type of AN, who's confused about the whole recovery process. At the moment I weigh 56 kg (\~123 lbs), at my lowest, about 5 months ago, I was 48.8 kg (\~108 lbs). After having won the fight against the fear of consuming more caloric foods than just veg, in this case milk produce and fruit, at the very start of this summer I have been steadily gaining \~1 kg (\~2 lbs) of weight per week. Yet, I am still very confused about my current situation.     Here's the deal:  * From the start of intense recovery (start of this summer) I still indulge in huge amounts of food consumption EVERY SINGLE DAY for breakfast and dinner (*amounting to &gt;1500 kcal each*), with a snack of fruits in between. (*Comes out to \~3000-4000 kcal/day*) * I live pretty actively: driving my bike everyday for a minimum of 1 hour, most of the day spend gardening and doing yard chores, spending little time sedentary.   **My questions are:**  1. How come, spending days non-passively, but consuming the lower end of a recommended daily amount of kcal for recovery, **I GAIN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF WEIGHT PER WEEK**? 2. My psychiatrist says that out of the \~3000-4000 kcal I consume daily, at best only half of them get absorbed. Is that true? 3.

92,"I had an ED PROFESSIONAL basically tell me that she can’t help me because I am in harm reduction mode.

To be denied care because the person isn’t “doing recovery” good enough is such a fucking paradox.

I’ve gone though phases where I would binge on whatever was in the pantry, or at friends homes. I would eat weird concoctions or condiments, anything and do it in hiding. I would wake up in the middle of the night for the majority of my late teens and all through my twenties and binge on whatever was around especially if I was sleeping at a friends. It gave me such immense shame.   Now, my Ed is different . I can easily live in the house with all my trigger foods and not eat them.

97,I’ve been crying the whole morning because I’ve realised that a lot of people think I’m older than I am. My fiancé had his friends over last night and when he told them the year I was born in they couldn’t believe it. I texted my fiancé what to ask what they meant by that but he didn’t respond and they left the house. I asked him this morning and he said he doesn’t remember why they were shocked. I can only assume that it’s because I look older.   My younger brother (3.5 years younger) avoids hanging out with me because I’m too old or not cool enough).   My coworkers keep forgetting my age and think I’m older than I am. I work in a virtual office but we do most of our meetings over video chat.   At Costco a few months ago one of the sample ladies offered me a “fridge magnet for the kids.” I joked about it with my fiancé later and he said “but I actually like that you look like a milf”  I know people typically associate weight with age so I can’t stop thinking that people feel this way about me because I am fat. I’ve been trying my hardest to keep my ed on the back burner for the holiday season. SNS has been inundating me with the stupid posts about how a woman is prettiest at 22 and people care more for pretty girls and now my birthday is coming and people think I’m older. I feel like I wasted my most attractive year. That now I’m stuck looking like I’ve had 3 kids for the rest of my life.

The difference: [https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH](https://imgur.com/a/o5px3tH)  My knees became knobby, I looked really really skinny. I was always hungry, I didn't care about anything other than nutrition and I didn't even talk to any of my friends. I noticed that I didn't have any urge to masturbate or talk to girls, which wasn't rly a problem to me at the time because of corona. I noticed my facial hair under my chin didn't grow at all until a few months ago. I was kinda cold and had night sweats.

By march 2021, I started reverse dieting and gradually reached 3200 calories by mid April(which still wasn't enough for a teen athlete). When we went back to school, I started interacting with other students and realized my personality completely changed. I felt like I was under them(which is ironic because before I felt I was the guy subconsciously). I had more social anxiety, my voice got lighter, and didn't have the flow of conversation anymore. That's when I realized I did something really wrong, which lead me to think I dramatically decreased my test levels. I started looking up the importance of fats in a diet and how low calorie diets lead to low testosterone and GH, and that broke me. I always wanted to develop and grow into a man and I was finally getting there before losing weight and dieting. My dad is about 6'2 and my mom is 5'8 (maybe 5'7)and I was my mom's height by the end of eight grade. I was 5'10.4 by Feb. 2020(junior year) and I really feel I was supposed to have gotten a growth spurt during this time. Unfortunately, I only grew an inch since this period(5'11.5), despite losing so much weight. As a guy, I severely underestimated the caloric needs of a young 17-18 year old male. I look even younger than I did in the early stages of the weight loss. (I'm about 171 ibs now and I feel alot better, but still not completely there hormonally)   I know this is kind of a rant, but is there any chance that once I fully recover from this that my body will rapidly catch up developmentally to confiscate for the delayed development and maturity? Did this one year and a few months permanently take a few inches of my growth potential?

104,"I’ve been struggling with anorexia for 6 years now and I am 20 years old. I’ve been through multiple relapses but this one has been the worst and physically I’m not in a good place.   I’ve once again started the “recovery” process, but this time I am taking a much different approach (more of harm reduction and a much slower pace). I have increased my food, added more variety to my diet and am working on myself and mindset everyday (which has been a huge challenge in itself). I posted a photo on my Instagram for my birthday which has now circulated around my extended family (who have not seen me in this state) and it is a shit show.   They are all calling/texting my parents blaming and shaming us. They believe I need to be in a hospital and questioning how my parents let it get this bad. It makes me sick to my stomach because this illness has absolutely destroyed my parents and it kills them to see me like this, and now they are dealing with all this. They are doing everything they can to be there for me and help/support me in the best way for me. They don’t understand that throwing me into treatment/in the hospital will not magically cure me. They don’t understand that “just eating” will not make everything go away.  I think the most frustrating thing is in the past years when I looked “healthy” no one cared. No one cared if I was so depressed and uncomfortable with my body and hated myself. All because I “looked healthy”. That’s the thing people don’t understand about anorexia, it’s a MENTAL ILLNESS.  Trust me, me and my family have tried everything. No one has the right to judge our decisions. I feel like I can’t even show myself at family get togethers now, I don’t even feel welcome at this point because of the judgment.  What kills me the most is the blame being put on my parents, especially since I am 20 YEARS OLD. People expect them to fix it and ask “why are you not doing anything”. Well, because they CANT. No one can force you to recover. The only way recovery works is if you choose it yourself.   It kills me to see my parents not only dealing with a sick daughter and doing there absolute best to be there and support me (which they have been amazing at) but are now dealing with all the judgment and drama of other people thinking they know what’s best/right when they haven’t even dealt with it before.

I eat &gt;!1000!&lt; calories a day and if I go over that I purge. I exercise to make this okay. I burn &gt;!500!&lt; cals a day in the gym. The binging and purging stops me from being underweight.

111,"I love that there is a sub for ""older"" (urrggh) folk with an ED, because it seems like the ""teenage girl with an eating disorder"" trope is so ingrained that it's hard to find a medium where I don't feel 1) incredibly ancient or 2) a complete idiot trainwreck loser because I *still* don't have my shit together when it comes to food/mental health etc..  Still, I haven't come across a lot of parents with ED in the subs and it would just be nice to have someone to talk to who can understand how that part of my life impacts my illness and vice versa.  ANyhoo. Myself (31F) and my husband (30M) have a brilliant, nearly one year old son and we're currently trying to conceive our second child. And I am kinda freaking out!  We got pregnant with our son sooo easily AND I was at a pretty low weight (112lbs) It's not my lowest weight but it was low for me at the time. I gained a good 42lbs whilst pregnant but I was still hitting the gym for the first two trimesters and did aquanatal for the full pregnancy and was just generally too excited about being a mummy to have my usual ED/disorded thoughts.  Fast-forward nearly a year and I am fully restricting, obsessive about food and calories and exercising etc. And I *need* to get back to the 112lb that I was. I should also mention that I had just horrific post natal depression and anxiety and that just fuelled my ED on top of everything else...  I am currently 128lbs and by this time next month I'll know if I am pregnant again or if we need to keep trying. My husband knows I want to ""get back down to my wedding weight"" He doesn't know about my ED or what my actual weight was/ is. But he is totally supporting my weight loss and I even mentioned that if we do fall pregnant right away again and I haven't lost the weight then I am gonna keep ""dieting"" and exercising during the first trimester until I am because "" loads of women don't even know they're pregnant in the first trimester anyway"" and again he fully supports this. He also doesn't think we're going to have any problems conceiving this time around because we didn't the first time.  I want to fall pregnant and I know I will gain weight again when/if I do. I just feel so FUCKING OVERWHELMED y'know ? I am so hormonal and emotional and I have all these ED thoughts and targets and obsessions on top of my PND telling me what a selfish awful mother I must be because this is something I am actually spending time and energy worrying about when I have this amazing handsome loving child and I am trying to conceive another absolute blessing. And of course there's just the day to day of being a working mum and wife and all the banal shit that goes along with that...

I stated my current feelings about her as a person and her lack of growth, and then I informed her that she has no place in my life moving forward. Our relationship is done.  It's been a few days now and the feeling of relief is still so strong. I feel clean in a way I never anticipated. It's beautiful. I've spent years trying to establish tighter boundaries and narrow the scope of our relationship down to something manageable. It never worked. To simply be DONE with her is so liberating.

Today I thought I would try and follow my meal plan to which I did, but in the evening for my evening snack I ate way more than I wanted to. Alongside this, I had a takeaway which was so scary to me yet my mind sort of went F it ?? I don’t know what happened this evening but I let go and it’s scared me and I want to restrict again and not follow my meal plan tomorrow. I don’t know what to do, I hate this cycle of restricting snd then sometimes I eat a lot more than I would like to and then it just goes round and round and round in a perpetual cycle of the same old thing.  Part of me wants to get better but the other part of me doesn’t and wants to lose the weight I’ve put on in recovery plus more . It’s a mindset of two conflicting points and I hate it. Part of me doesn’t want to eat but then the other part of me just wants to eat all these fatty sugary foods (and other stuff too but mostly those types of foods) which I know rationally is because I’ve restricted myself of nutrients so my body is like PlEAsE FEEd M3 which I get but it’s just so hard to allow myself when I feel like I can’t! Plus , I’m still so bloody hungry and I don’t even know how I can be after what I’ve eaten? My stomach is grumbling almost an hour after and another thing is that I can’t stop thinking about food. Is this extreme hunger , idk I’m just ConFuSION and highly frustrated!  Sorry this may not make sense I’m probably rambling a lot I just felt like I needed to get it out there.

My therapist said basically said “no, you can’t be eating all that! Protein balls and protein shakes are so disgusting. I ONLY eat fruit and vegetables, but right now I am on a 9 week juice fast.”  Now, I can only eat protein shake and fruit, like no dinner other than purging… by the way, this “therapist” has no qualifications.

We are playing Danish Vikings and he has been bulking for the past year to gain muscle for the role. However, the shoot is nearly upon us and he begins his cut in a week.   One of the rituals I’ve found most difficult to overcome during these early stages of recovery is being able to eat when nobody else is. I have found it makes it immensely easier to eat (and keep it down) when we have meals together. Especially since he is trying to pile in as many calories as possible, I can trick Ana into thinking I’m eating less because it looks small in comparison.   In a nutshell, I am guilty of constantly comparing my portions and calories to his to ensure that I eat a significantly smaller portion than he does. However, my BMI is less than 16 at the moment and I’m in the middle of a relapse already.

I am now incredibly scared and just so fucking embarrassed.   I’ve heard that you can get it from laxative abuse or constipation. I didn’t abuse laxatives but I did use it two times this month because both times I was constipated for a week. I’ve also just took a shit on my own but I strained and apparently straining is bad and can cause hemorrhoids (why tf have i never known about this).

125,"Apologies in advance for what may end up being a long, mildly incoherent rant, and for poor formatting (on mobile).     My province has been on ""shutdown"" for about a month now, and I have been out of work for just as long. I was coping okay-ish with that, mostly following a most predictable pattern of ""wake up, drink lots of coffee, smoke weed, pass the time until it's 7pm and it's time to make dinner, then game, drink a bottle of wine and binge on plain popcorn until tired"".    Concurrently, I was dealing with a water infiltration issue under my floor (basement apartment) which had started in October last year but has gotten much worse with spring and the snow melt, on which my landlord has been dragging his feet. Now...this issue was...tolerable until two weekends ago, when the water issue got so bad I had to call emergency contractors, who then came and basically ripped up and dried my floor. In the meantime, I packed up my two cats and went to live with my parents for a few weeks, while everything is getting finally fixed.     It's been a bit over a week now of being back at my parents' place. My mom is aware of my ED, and, in her way, is very supportive (which at first blew my mind because she was...less so when I first developped it 14 years ago). She doesn't pressure me to eat every meal (I just have to eat dinner), she got my dad to get me some of my safe foods so I can always have a safe snack, and she lets me make my own plate when I do eat, without comments.    My dad has also gotten better at commenting on what/when I eat, which is weird and surprising and unexpected, considering his petty comments fueled my ED all my adolescence.     However, the family dynamic hasn't changed, and being back there, as odd as it may seem, makes me feel like I am once again that 16 year old kid that tries to be as quiet as possible, that tries to not inconvenience or get in the way, the way an unxpected guest might. This has been brillantly fueling my restrictive ED, especially because my room is next to my parents', they go to bed earlyish and the dog stays with them (if she hears me go to the kitchen, she will jump off their bed and run downstairs. She's not a small dog by any means). So I eat like...one meal a day, with a light snack after, and 2 hours later, I can't fall asleep because all I want is to make pancakes and eat them without anyone hearing me.  The point to this rant, I guess, is that I miss having my place, my freedom, my schedule, my shitty habits and my even shittier midnight snacks, but at the same time, being back home is teaching me a whole 'nother level of discipline through anxiety, and I lost &gt;!3.5lbs!&lt; in less than a week thanks to a lot of repressed trauma from my adolescence and constantly feeling like I have to prepare a justification for everything I eat.

I used to stretch every kind of food to Last me longer and adjust them to suit my cravings for so long that I never realized those Peas were actually gone REALLY bad. I have been eating them for the past 2 Or 3 weeks and never realized it was so acidic because I would only Eat 2 Or 3 of them and Mix it with various diabolical food inventions. Moreover, I ate a few bites of a chocolate and tasted NOTHING at first. It literally felt like chewing nothing. It wasn't until a few hours later that I tried them again and actually was able to sense its taste.  Today I learned that I forgot the taste of most of the foods. Sorry if this is basic Or very common but I felt pretty surprised at this revelation. Maybe I denied myself enjoying food for so long that I programmed myself into not tasting it?   At the same time, I have this nagging thought in my head that I was able to escape from the overly addictive sugar and other harmful ingredients pushed by the huge food companies and now I surrendered to them, and NOT to being a healthy person.

Then I lowered my intake to 1600 because I’m really inactive. But the following months my periods stopped again and so on till July when I got them again. Since then I gat my periods in January and July.  I never went to the doctor because I was fine.

135," My weight has fluctuated over the years (not too good at eating properly) and currently, at 5'10, I am the heaviest I have ever been (185lb, at least 15lb overweight). My lowest weight was something like 120lb, in 2015 or so. During lockdown I went from 175lb to 140lb, and once the world opened up again my weight crept up. I've had my thyroid checked and it is very slightly low but they only tested one marker (my mum takes medication for her low thyroid stuff). I can't believe I let myself get like this. I can't look in the mirror or have sex with my boyfriend. Literally half of my clothes do not fit.   I've found it hard to exercise because I'm very aware of the weight and size of my stomach. My favourite is the rowing machine but it's upsetting me to go on it because I feel so lumbering and heavy and huge. When I walk around, I feel weighed-down by my stomach. I also like rock climbing but right now, do not feel safe because of my weight. I hate my body too much to go swimming too. I prefer things which are easier on my joints.   (I know weight loss happens in the kitchen. For me, it only seems to happen when I undereat drastically, to the point of passing out).  Does anyone have any ideas of what exercises I can do to get stronger? I have hypermobile joints and so I need to be careful with weight lifting.   Thank you xx  P.S. I have set myself a goal to lose 5lb a month. That should mean by August I am 150lb, which is my goal weight for a big holiday I am going on.

It was terrifying.   This is going to sound so fucking asinine, but I was starving, so I forced myself to eat something. Within maybe 20 minutes, I felt like 75% better. Then I started craving sugar. Like, BADLY. And I never want/eat sweets. Now I’ve eaten a salad, a yogurt, two chocolate bars and some berries and I feel like a thousand bucks. And I want more.

145,"Last night I got into a pretty horrible fight with my partner because he was drunk (more accurately he was fighting “at” me, which used to be a very common occurrence unfortunately). He’s struggled with alcoholism for many years, but last night was the first time in a long time that he relapsed. I won’t go into the details (he wasn’t psychically or sexually abusive), but it was extremely scary and difficult for me emotionally. He has quit drinking once again (as of today), but my anxiety is through the fucking roof.   I have been trying to attempt quasi-recovery for the last few weeks, and although I intended to eat dinner last night, I did not because I was so scared and distraught by my partner’s behavior. I actually had to call out of work today, which I NEVER do, because my anxiety has been so bad. He’s been sick all day throwing up from the alcohol, and once his stomach settled he told me that he was going to maybe order a pizza (we have basically no food in the house and I have exhausted all of my safe foods, which he wouldn’t eat anyway). I told myself that I should try to eat a slice of pizza, but he ended up ordering something he knew I really didn’t like and now he’s just eating like a fucking king while I’m angry, anxious and starving and I’m pissed at him for yet another reason. It’s so fucking dumb but like… you’re not even going to ask me if I want anything? After fucking terrorizing me for 8 hours last night?

How about we don’t focus on people’s bodies???? And it’s so obvious she’s lying when she says she doesn’t mean it as an insult.

155,"Obviously you hear all the ~reasons to recover~ shit, which lbr is mainly about looking sexually appealing to straight dudes. Not all that motivating when you're (a) a man and/or (b) up to your eyeballs in sexual trauma.   I wanted to point out some unexpected positive things I *have* noticed since eating better and being a healthier weight.   - Waaaaaay easier to be physically active, like obviously I have more energy but I'm also not getting constant cramps and joint pains like I used to and I recover way quicker. I thought climbing might be harder now I'm a bit heavier but it's actually easier.  - Related: I can lift heavy shit and it makes me feel like a big man. Single handedly manhandled a sofa up 2 flights of stairs yesterday 💪  - I sleep A LOT better, I have PTSD so it's never like amazing but falling asleep is easier and I'm not waking up a million times a night with a racing heart/joint pains/being freezing cold/etc.  - Not freezing cold all the time! Still need to wear layers obvs, it's December and I'm in the UK. It's normal-person layers though, not like two pairs of trackies and three coats.  - No one wants to hear about my sex life but yeah.   - I always told myself that starvation made me ""emotionally numb"" but it was 100% absolute bullshit, I was all over the place.

158,"So over the weekend I saw a post on here talking about the ketogenic diet and expressing frustration with people trying to push keto onto people.  And I do get being annoyed and upset at people who are on keto trying to push keto onto everyone they come across. Especially as people who are trying to recover from harm done by restrictive eating behavior.  I admit I’m guilty of this myself, especially because keto has helped me reverse my BED which is caused by insulin resistance by overconsumption of carbs, in relation to the metabolic disease I have, PCOS. So I do tend to recommend it to people who have the same issue.   But some of the comments I saw on that post were just plain mean and nasty for no reason. I don’t think it’s fair to be made fun of or called “orthorexic” for how I have to treat this disease. I don’t think it’s fair that ED recovery only centers eating without any sort of calculation or restriction when it may be necessary for those of us trying to recover from BED.  Someone on another post mentioned that there seems to be a hierarchy of ED’s within recovery communities and it seems like BED recovery is at the bottom of the totem pole, simply because BED recovery doesn’t always look like recovery from other ED’s.   For one it should be common sense that treatment for restrictive ED’s such as &gt;!ana/bulimia!&lt;  is going to be different from recovery for excessive consumption disorders (aka BED) as they are both on the opposite side of the behavioral spectrum. So this idea that the only type of valid ED recovery is recovery that centers moving away from &gt;!restriction!&lt; is a very narrow minded and myopic viewpoint of recovery, that only seems to center restrictive ED’s, with no room for analyzing recovery from BED.  I get that there’s a smaller portion of us who suffer from BED than there are ppl who suffer from ED’s that cause &gt;!restriction!&lt;, but we still matter. And our recovery shouldn’t be painted with the same brush as recovery from restrictive ED’s.   It’s already bad enough that there’s such little support for recovering from BED, but to see folks looking down upon and labeling those of us who have to use very different methods for recovery is hurtful.  If you read most peer reviewed studies and medical guidance for treating both BED caused by insulin resistance in relation to PCOS and other symptoms of PCOS, you will see overwhelming support of centering certain foods and &gt;!eliminating/restricting!&lt; other foods. And no, that’s not the result of wanton diet culture infiltrating medical treatment. We have legitimate proof that the &gt;!restriction!&lt; of certain foods when you have this disease makes dealing with the BED and other symptoms caused by this disease easier to deal with   So automatically declaring all of us who have used keto/monitoring our carbohydrate intake and yes, &gt;!RESTRICTION!&lt; (dun dun dun) of certain foods to help treat our binging and other symptoms caused by this disease as “orthorexic” and calling what we eat nasty and chiding us for not being able to “eat normally” and “care free” is mean at best, and dare I say ableist at worst. Some of us really don’t have a choice.    I understand that the concept of using restriction to treat an ED sounds oxymoronic or dangerous to most “normal”/able bodied people who suffer from ED’s that cause restriction, but this is how disability works sometimes. ED recovery for most able bodied people usuallt centers moving away from restriction and towards eating whatever and not being afraid of any type of food.   My ED recovery as a disabled person with a metabolic disorder that leads to binging includes &gt;!restriction!&lt; of foods that make my binging and other symptoms of the disease I have worse. It’s as simple as that.  That doesn’t make me a freak or orthorexic, and it doesn’t warrant me or any others who are in the same boat as me being put down or made fun of for not being able to eat without &gt;!restriction!&lt;  Please don’t take this post as the promotion of keto or any other form of restriction. That’s not my goal here. I should be allowed to detail how it as helped me fond relief from my BED without it being interpreted as promoting the diet.   I’m really sorry but there has to be some balance… there’s no need to shame or label those of us who have used diet change to help with our ED’s, the same way there’s no need for those of us who have made changes to our diet to shame other people who don’t wish to make the same changes, and find those changes hindering to their recovery.   Let’s all be kinder to each other please.   I’m sorry if this wasn’t appropriate to post on here but I don’t know where else to say it. If this is a “bad” post I’ll take it down.

Not even relating to other ED sufferers made me feel even more isolated and lost, on top of the general isolation of having an ED. I only developed one as an adult, and feeling like I’m struggling with the disorder of a teenager has been so invalidating and distressing. I hate that a place like this has to exist, but I love that we are here to support each other.

I had been throwing up for about 6 hours and having diarrhea, I was so lethargic and nauseous I couldn't handle the pain anymore. My mon wad planning on driving me but I kept losing consciousness and couldn't get to the car so she called an ambulance. A load of EMS came into my room, I had my eyes clothes and was wearing a t-shirt, Walmart sweatpants, and an Adult Depends pad because of my diarrhea and inability to control my bowels. There was vomit all over my bed and towels so my mom put the diaper on me because she figured it was the best thing.   They asked my mom what was wrong. She told them I have Anorexia and have taken some laxatives last night, and that I've been throwing up and the pain usually subsides but is getting worse and that when I drink juice or water I threw it up. They asked what I take and my mom was in a panic so scared and just took a bottle out from my drawer and says she takes this Dulcolax I've seen her get this from Amazon and she takes this diuretic. And then the rude EMS worker asked how does she get money and my mom said she's almost 23 she gets money from working, school, and owns a car I can't really control it if I would I could I'm really worried about her pain right now. I could hear the guy taking my vitals saying that I seemed ""high as a kite like I take pain pills,"" which I don't I was just not conscious so I was mumbling and almost drooling on myself and praying which I guess praying for God to heal me is also weird to them too.   They took me in the ambulance and were really rough with me trying to stick an IV in my neck I said please no use my arm please and they did and got it. After that I just let my body lose complete responsiveness to receive the fluids and feel the AC on me and I could hear them saying my Systolic Blood Pressure was 50 and that I was critical. But they were also saying a lot more.   They said, ""That mother was talking our ear off she was such an anxious mess and what an enabler look at this kid she's skeletal,"" ""I would never let my kid be anorexic I beat that boy's ass when I caught him smoking weed once and cut him off from all his friend's, I'd beat my kid til they stopped this,"" ""I understand being an alcoholic or doing some drugs to make you feel good but I'll never understand girls and eating disorders they don't even get a benefit from it,"" ""This COVID crap is such bullshit I had it for a few days and took Ivermectin and I'm fine,"" ""This grown woman is in a diaper, can't imagine college is too fun with that,"" Also talking right-winged conspiracy theories.  I could hear every single word they said, I just couldn't respond. They only said it because they thought I couldn't hear it.   I am in the hospital now, my blood pressure has improved after 3 bags of fluids (I hate it I'm swollen and bloated as hell). They were able to hold off on a blood transfusion.

I've started for the first time to notice severe physical affects on my hands and I'm really worried. My hands are full of cuts, the skin is so dry that they crack and bleed when I move them. I am also losing mobility incmy fingers. I am no longer able to straighten my fingers properly on my left hand and when forced into place (my mom tried to stretch my hand out a bit to help get my fingers straight) I was screaming in excruciating pain from the skin and joints burning and pulling. I put on some ointment and I have been washing my hands and trying to wear gloves when I can.

170,"So I've been friends since we were like 16 and I'm 22 now. I'm not in high school, I'm a grown woman who goes to school, has worked, and has other responsibilities to attend to in life besides my eating disorder. I have Anorexia Nervosa, Binge-Purge Subtype by definition, and when we met I strictly restricted. When I met her I refused all food, I was in and out of hospitals with feeding tubes, all that crap. Now I do all the grocery shopping, I cook, I eat over 1200 calories per day, but I do struggle with maintaining a healthy weight and deal with laxative and exercise abuse. I don't binge but I do engage in compensatory behaviors that honestly I try to keep private from people outside of my family and a few trusted friends because a lot of people just don't understand anything beyond starving, vomiting, whatever they've heard eating disorders are.   So my friend wanted to hang out this week and even though I literally cook dinner almost every fucking night for my family, go out to eat with them, all that shit, she makes everything about food. She looks at me and sees that I am underweight and just believes that I ""never eat"" and that pisses me the fuck off as I pour my creamer in my coffee and sit here in bed with my leftovers from last night that really pisses me off okay. She asked if I wanted to go out to eat or do something else and honestly with buying groceries and my car payment and my college tuition lately I'm not sure if going out to eat would be ideal because it does cost a lot of money that I could use towards groceries for us or my car or whatever I need, but I do want to hangout. I just don't want to spend a ton of money, you know? So I said hanging out at either of our houses is cool with me honestly (I can make myself food where ever I am, I have food at home), and she said the dumbest shit. She said she likes to go out to eat with me to ""make sure that I'm eating even when we're hanging out and not sacrificing my health hangout."" I understand the thought but she's done this a lot where she'll just randomly ask me if I'm eating and crap and it makes me feel super triggered by old feelings and like I'm being watched for how I eat? I try to eat relatively normally and my family and other friends don't comment on how I eat so this just makes me really pissed. I've explained to her that my eating disorder constitutes a lot more than not eating but this just makes me feel super invalid. The ignorance of it makes me feel like every time I voluntarily eat, I may as well just not even have an eating disorder if that makes sense and maybe it's just made up.   I don't know if it's fair to be annoyed but this really really bothers me to the point where I'm starting to dread talking to her and feeling pushed away",harmful,harmful,harmful,Friend making comments about eating habits and food choices,Friend constantly monitoring and commenting on the writer's eating habits,Friend's lack of understanding and constant comments about the writer's eating disorder,"Triggers negative feelings and emotions related to the individual’s eating disorder, Makes the individual feel invalidated and misunderstood","Makes the writer feel triggered by old feelings and like they are being watched for how they eat, Causes the writer to feel invalid and like their eating disorder is being dismissed","Feeling invalidated and triggered by the friend, Starting to dread talking to the friend and feeling pushed away",olr9l5,"[0.02915631162245782, 0.00022215185669055307, 0.07324148903260076, 0.05260243335481338, 0.09864362334859335, 0.17559371486482406, 0.08096285440352767, 0.14469358873325097, 0.2005654490060496, 0.020816919363493325, 0.022499301467266346, 0.0007937176405976893, 0.000601022508759621, 0.021126976695656136, 0.0005168722984553957, 0.019279864666408415, 0.0005416404452425588, 0.002794941956643118, 0.030233316864891925, 0.025113809869777237]",1.0,,makeupyourworld,,,,,1626473412.0,1.0,,,8,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,536.0,,/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/olr9l5/im_like_really_freaking_annoyed_right_now/,1.0,11.0,EdAnonymousAdults,t5_s5o7i,I'm like really freaking annoyed right now,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdAnonymousAdults/comments/olr9l5/im_like_really_freaking_annoyed_right_now/
171,"I've been going to the doctor a lot and begging for referrals for a cardiologist, gastroenterologist, and have been deciding whether I want to do inpatient treatment. Finally got my referrals to get someone decent to check my heart and refill my ulcer medicine. My anorexia relapse has been really bad, my BMI is in the 12's, I'm 74.6 pounds and I'm not super short, I'm abusing laxatives, having incontinence issues/losing feeling in my colon, experiencing numbness in my limbs every few days, weakness, heart palpitations, frequent fevers of 102+. It's been really awful. After I got out of the hospital in February I started getting more frequent labwork which has shown consistently low sodium, potassium, glucose, along with high cholesterol. My body is just all over the place and I really want to wean off the laxatives and get help. Yesterday I had a telehealth appointment again to go over my recent labs, he tells my my labs aren't that good, but it's no big deal because ""you have no real symptoms!"" I said, what do you mean I have no symptoms? I've been admitted to the hospital and had to come in a few times because I've had fainting, dizziness, choking on vomit in my sleep, and chest pain. Been honest about everything including the laxatives, to which he just blows off and says, ""well stop taking 'em!"" even though last time I did that I went in withdrawal and got admitted to the hospital and needed fluid drained because I got so swollen I couldn't walk.   At the end of the phone call he says, ""well if you're having some symptoms drink some Gatorade. We gotta get you eating again and fix that anorexic problem!"" and started laughing.

172,"So I'm relapsing and it's awful, I didn't have much room to begin with. It's only been like two weeks and I feel so burnt out. I'm 76 lbs and my BMI is like 13.1. I was in the hospital last week for dehydration, I went because my chest was hurting and it was hard to breathe and they said my sodium levels were low and I was dehydrated and kept me for a few days. During those few days I felt so overwhelmed by my fear of the hospital and I barely ate. Each night my mom brought me grilled chicken from chick fil-a (safe food for me) and I had some broccoli and grapes. It's been a week now and my appetite is gone. Before I was eating 2 meals per day and 2 snacks. Now I am eating 2 ""meals,"" one which is substantial and one that's just yogurt. I've been getting full so fast and am forgetting to drink water. My body feels so weak that when I'm home alone I don't have the energy to fill my water cup from the fridge. I've been staying with my mom at night because I'm in so much pain and feel so weak.   She has said that my breathing sounds very labored. I get out of breath very easily. For example, yesterday after dinner I loaded the dishwasher and within 10 minutes I was shaky and out of breath to the point where I felt like I could pass out and throw up. She said she's noticed at night I'm breathing so heavily, I wake up constantly gasping for air. In addition, my skin has started to peel all over. I haven't used anything different but the skin on my hands is peeling, around my lips, cheeks, chest. It's so nasty looking. I'm trying to get down 8 ounces of juice right now and I still have half left. It's been 40 minutes already. I feel so tormented by this and can't find a therapist that isn't over $130 PER HOUR. I can't afford that. :( I have severe ptsd as well and know that has made eating harder. I'm having night terrors and nothing seems all that desirable and I need constant reassurance to eat. Oh I also forgot I'm having muscle spasms. Like my leg will start spasming to the point where I scream, or I'll lose control of my fingers in my hand for a few minutes straight. I had a telehealth appt yesterday and she said to come in for labs on Tuesday. Even on the phone she said I sounded very out of breath and asked if I was okay. She had me take my vitals and said my heart rate was really high (in the hospital it was up to 149 resting, yesterday it was in the 120's laying in bed) and blood pressure runs low. I don't know what's wrong. I've weighed a little lower than this before when I was younger but i feel like my body can't take it this time. What are these symptoms and does anyone else relate?

176,"I’m a few months into recovery, gaining weight, challenging fear foods, etc. there have been a few slip ups but overall it has been a positive trajectory. I’m still underweight but getting there. I found the concept of ‘all in’ too stressful for me, so have been taking a bit of a slower approach.   I’m still counting calories but using it as a way to ensure I’m meeting my minimums (this is with approval from my treating team).

I’m so nervous. I’m also excited to spend these nights with my friends and celebrate us finishing uni.   This could go either way: 1. It could be amazing, flip a switch in my brain, help me get back to my old self who would have LOVED the idea of being away with friends with good food, cheese platters, and alcohol.  Or 2. I freak out, restrict, don’t involve myself.   I’m really hoping it’s the first. But I can’t seem to shake ED thoughts from creeping in (e.g. ‘I’m not cooking, how much oil are they going to use???’ ‘We could have this same thing but with lower calories if we used low fat yoghurt’ ‘you’re going to gain so much weight from this trip’)   Now I’m lucky that my friends all know I’m in recovery and know that this will be a challenge for me. I’m just still so scared.   Anyway. Just looking for some well wishes. I hope I can return and let you all know that it went so well and that I’m back to my old self.",unknown,unknown,unknown,"Being a few months into recovery, taking a slower approach, going on a holiday with friends","Being a few months into recovery, gaining weight, challenging fear foods, and taking a slower approach to recovery","Recovery process, going on a holiday with friends","Feeling nervous and scared about the potential impact of the holiday on their recovery, Experiencing ED thoughts about food and weight gain, Having supportive friends who are aware of their recovery journey","Feeling nervous and scared about going on a holiday with friends and not having control over the food, Experiencing ED thoughts related to food and weight gain","Taking a slower approach to recovery and counting calories to ensure minimums are met, Nervous and scared about going on holiday with friends and not having control over food choices, Hoping that the holiday will be a positive experience and help with recovery",yuceui,"[0.0016337475355518885, 0.000385151879099961, 0.015174298006515635, 0.021319265408594665, 0.1710216491544414, 0.08081882456474158, 0.007597295767338028, 0.07616176925678121, 0.05423385058728879, 0.0011513285763740835, 0.12286290393791446, 0.0013760940165213904, 0.056945435719147786, 0.0016888850293798872, 0.0008961182677942349, 0.16619675750341817, 0.0009390596071960819, 0.15858009615167884, 0.0035009864553769703, 0.057516482574844825]",1.0,,naji_66,,,,,1668369901.0,1.0,,,4,-1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,295.0,,/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/yuceui/wish_me_luck/,1.0,1.0,AnorexiaRecovery,t5_o3plh,Wish me luck,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaRecovery/comments/yuceui/wish_me_luck/

181,"All right folks, this may be the millionth time I'm attempting recovery, but something happened to me that seriously turned the switch and I'm taking this as a sign of ""now or never,"" otherwise known as, bitch you've been at this for 26 years, that's enough.  From about Christmas to just a few days ago, I went through a particularly awful phase of binging and purging. We're talking almost daily BP sessions, sometimes twice a day, followed by periods of restriction. All in all, a total mess and it was the worst my ED has been in a long time.   Then yesterday, I just spent my 37th birthday in absolute pain because of a severe lower back injury I sustained on Tuesday, the same injury that took me over a month to recover from in September 2018. All of the fun plans I had for my birthday went flying out the window with my body's health. As I'm struggling to find a comfortable position to rest on the couch, I just got so fed up with my ED bullshit and realized that I'm completely fucking up my body's health. I swear the combination of my ED and lack of exercise (because I didn't want to gain fucking water weight of all things, I stopped engaging in healthy exercise to counteract my sedentary desk job) culminated in a sharp decline in my overall condition, leading to this ridiculous injury that was completely avoidable.  I'm seriously so pissed at myself for caring so much about my body's appearance over its health. I'm in so much fucking pain every time I walk. I'm bent over like an old lady and walking in the weirdest shuffle motion, sitting for even 5 minutes at a time is uncomfortable, and I can hardly get any work done.   Worst of all, I'm starting a new job on Monday that I'm SO excited for, but I'm afraid I won't be well enough to actually go into the office on my first day. What a great way to make a good first impression, eh?  This ED is fucking up my life and health and I hate it. I'm so done with 26 years of bullshit that have put my health through the ringer and this injury is literally the straw that broke the camel's back. I know I still have lots of work to do (mentally/emotionally), but I'm finally ready to leave this ED behind. I don't know what recovery looks like for me and maybe it's a bad idea to try to do this on my own, but I'm going to take it one day at a time and keep reminding myself of how much I don't want to deal with this pain again (sitting here typing this right now, I am so uncomfortable that I want to scream). Seriously, if I don't have my health, I have nothing.  I haven't been part of this community for very long, but from the bottom of my heart, I'm sending you all so much love and hope that you find your ways to recovery, whatever that may be for you. I promise you, even after dealing with ED for so much of my life, change IS possible. It just took a fucking painful back injury to get ME there.   TL;DR: sick of 26 years of ED shit, health declining, ready for recovery.

182,"So I gained a lot of weight in my late teens, then lost a lot of weight, more than what I weigh now and naturally got left with some loose skin. I have already had one operation to remove it on my neck, and was told by my plastic surgeon that surgery on my breasts and tummy would most likely be covered by insurance if I wanted to get those operated on as well, which I definitely do.   The problem is that it’s all I can think about a lot of the time, and the skin makes me feel ugly. Even when I was at a much higher weight, I had some excess skin and I remember thinking that I would rather be heavier without it than thin and have it. I guess I changed my mind at some point and sort of focused on numbers until I hit a weight where I had to recover or my life was going to become much more complicated, and since late last year I have been in recovery. My eating is okay right now, I’d say pretty normal. I have been maintaining for months. I could gain some more weight, I’m at the minimum “healthy weight” but the doctor I see doesn’t seem concerned and I eat whenever I’m hungry, sometimes even when I’m not and don’t deal with any other ED behaviors at the moment so I’m doing pretty well on that front.  But yeah, the loose skin… I think about it all the time and can’t wait until I can have more surgery to remove it. Like I said, the breast lift and tummy tuck (I assume these are the surgeries that I would have) are very likely to be covered by insurance, but I also have excess skin on my arms and thighs and was told that these surgeries I would have to pay out of pocket for if I were to get them.  Sometimes I don’t even want to leave the house because thinking about this makes me feel so down even though my clothes cover it, unless I were to wear sleeveless or crop tops which I never do. I’m not sure what to do about this. Obviously I shouldn’t base my happiness around this but it’s so hard not to think about these “flaws”. I have thought of joining a gym but I have other health issues that make working out difficult. Plus it would not remove the loose skin, only maybe make it a little less visible if I gained some muscle underneath it? I’m not sure but supposedly it has helped some.

186,"So I’ve struggled with anorexia (b/p subtype) off and on for 10 years. In my late 20s. I’ve recently hit a new low this year, thanks to plummeting into a depression that has killed all my motivation, creativity and drive. I’m a musician and have stopped playing or writing. Throughout my 20s I was at least able to maintain some semblance of normalcy while keeping my disorder at bay and not letting it consume me entirely, my worst fear has always been losing my identity to my disorder. I used to want to pursue music, make things, be someone. Now I just want to lose weight, b/p, restrict, isolate and sleep.  Now here I am almost 30 and still struggling, just as bad as I was back then but this time I have a partner, a job, a dog and bills to pay. I feel like such a failure. I work in a chaotic restaurant which also fuels my disorder in many ways (I grew up in chaos so it’s very familiar) and isn’t good for my mental health long term. I feel like I have lost my purpose in life and I no longer know who I am. A big part of me really wants to go back to school but it’s been so long and I am afraid of debt and not being smart enough. I’m at my lowest weight right now but because I’m short/petite it’s not super obvious. Which I hate.  My partner basically gave me an intervention today, telling me that now is the time to get treatment so I can get better and we can plan for our future. I feel so guilty and scared. I don’t feel sick enough to deserve to go to treatment and I never have. But if I wanted to go, I could and I am lucky to have that option.  I’m just so so so scared.

187,"I was wondering if anyone else struggles with stealing food from other people and shoplifting food from supermarkets?  I’m 19 and I’ve had an ED for 7 years. It began with anorexia the bulimia then binge eating but I’ve been attempting to be recovery focused for 3/4 years now, but still struggle with stealing food. I’ve been stealing food from whoever I live with, wether that be flatmates or family. It began as a binging thing but I don’t binge anymore so It’s pretty much a compulsion at this point. I’m not strapped for cash and I CAN afford to buy myself food so it’s not a money thing. I often find myself stressed out and wasting loads of money trying to replace my flatmates food in a rush before they notice.   I also steal food from supermarkets, but I do this less out of compulsion and more out of greed I think. It’s usually protein bars and expensive things I don’t want to spend money on. When I do a weekly food shop I always feel like I have to shoplift the expensive things because I can’t justify spending more than £X amount on groceries for the week for myself, even though I’m not tight for money. I feel like I can’t justify spending money on food as it makes me feel “greedy” (??) but on the other hand I feel like I’m being greedy and selfish by stealing the food. I’ve been caught once stealing protein powder at whole foods and I don’t want to risk being caught again.   Stealing from my flatmates has caused them to get very suspicious and hostile at each other (I don’t think they suspect it’s me) but I can’t help but feel that they will find out eventually if I don’t manage my habit and stop now.

188,"When I was a teenager (around 10 years ago) I used to be really bad. Hospitalized bad. I then accepted my body over time for not being perfect but I was a healthy weight and I ate normally because I have other health conditions (epilepsy and RA and autism which all are affected by blood sugar) and I’m on so many pills a day I had to just get in the a habit of eating to not throw them up.   I was doing so well.   I moved out of my apartment after living in a very walking-friendly part of town to a place no one walks, and, i stay inside all day so naturally my weight went up because I wasn’t walking 30 min to school everyday and walking to my friends houses and to go get food and hand out. I never realized that when I stopped walking (especially I went into a coma and had to be in a wheelchair or walker for a while so very sedentary life style), even though for my conditions I should be doing minor exercise daily.  The big problem is I’ve been stopping all the medications I can that I heard have caused weight gain for people and my doctors don’t want me to go off them and I didn’t even tell them!

192,"People can be really mean🥲 (Long Rant)  My depression worsened few months ago and led to full onset of restrictive AAN. I made sure I hide all my pain well because I know people around me don’t really get mental illness. But with restricting, I can’t really hide how my body shape changed drastically in only four or five months.  I have been on family vacation for the past week, and I received many probing questions or comments about my eating behavior and my weight, though no one knows about my mental health conditions. I stayed composed dealing with those, until one particular comment. We got to a new hotel and my mom found out the room has a scale. She was curious about my weight so she pushed me to weigh myself. Even with me trying to intake more during family meals, the nature of busy vacation causes a significant drop in weight. My mom got very excited and shared the news with her husband. Her ruthless/cold/cruel/full of sh*t (excuse my language) husband replied with: “She probably throws up whenever she goes to the toilet and becoming an anorexic.”  I just can’t control myself after that. I went into a full breakdown crisis mode. It took me lots of effort to reach out for help, trying to do damage control before potentially developing behaviors other than pure restriction. I have also been battling with suicidal ideation: trying to stay alive has been a really hard task. And ironically, I was trying to stay alive because I don’t want my family to be impacted for rest of their lives. On top of dealing with these chaos alone, being randomly accused and targeted is not helping. I just feel so helpless. I hate when people are so ignorant and mean. I never shared my illness with my family because I don’t want them to worry, and I know they won’t understand. The only thing I have hoped is that they don’t make things worse. I never even asked any support or comfort from them. But I guess with all the hiding I still cannot prevent myself from being hurt by the supposedly closest people to me. And I still have few days of vacation left with my family. With me acting out, I got the silent treatment from them, so the next few days are going to be interesting………….

193,"Hi, I suffer from anorexia nervosa (and other mental health issues) sense I was 14 years old, I won’t say any other details about it so it won’t be triggering.  In a week or two I will go to a retreat (residential) for eating disorder, I am still working on other aspects of my mental health by going to group therapy, for almost two years, and now I am more stable and have enough tools to take the “next step”.  I am scared about trying something new or that I will fail and that it will be a waste of time and money,  don’t want to put weight on because even if I’m under weight I still see myself “heavy” and need to count calories to feel less anxious.   My ED has taken over  7 years of my life, and this is the worse that I’ve ben, not being able to even go to the beach and wearing long pants even in the middle of summer and I can’t even see or smell food that I feel so nauseous.  All my low self-esteem now comes by my ED, people continue saying how skinny I am or  “oooh do you ever eat because you look like you don’t” “Where does your food go when you are eating?I only see bones” “You need to eat you look really skinny” “You don’t eat I can see it” “You look like your ill” “Do you have food in your house?” “Does your dad neglect you?” And other things that trigger me so much.  People have ben commenting on about my body sense I remember, every time someone had to find something bad. I don’t believe when people say that I’m pretty or beautiful because they are being pity and the only thing that I see is not my body, but something else like I don’t belong in and it’s not mine.   It’s taken over so much that I can’t start a job or finish school for how much stressful it is, I am really regretting that I will go in this recovery program. It’s taken over my friendships and my old relationships because people cared about me and wanted me to eat but I would just say that I didn’t want to and they would get frustrated. It takes over my “intimate life”   But I don’t want to get better and I think that I will actually dropping out of the retreat after a couple of days.  I don’t feel even validated because my dad doesn’t understand, even if I eat something small he starts saying “oh. .is that because you suffer from ED?” and that makes me want to starve myself because I need to show him and prove what is really going on. When I told him about the program he only said “why all of the sudden you are putting your ED as a priority? i see you eat” and that makes me feel like actually I have no problems when it comes to food or I am doing all this for attention and he is making me regret to start the program.  My mom and other members of the family think that I’m crazy and just being childish when it comes to food and being picky and then when my therapist told to her what wad going on she didn’t believe her or me, she only said that I was not that skinny and I didn’t need to go see a doctor. And then when my mom/dad cook food for me and I don’t eat they always put money in the conversation saying that they payed, I mean it’s true but I told them that I don’t eat a lot of food.  The  only thing that keeps me going is the support of my few friends and my GF that say that even if they don’t have an ED like me and don’t understand about the situation 100% are proud of me and want the best and see me happy and succede in a carrier and be here for me when I most needed.  I know that I have to do this for me and nobody else but me, but only thinking about it makes me feel anxious, depressed and so guilty about my life choices or emotions. What happens once I recover? Will people recognize how I look because I will be in a normal weight range? Will people criticize me saying how I didn’t need to loose weight?

194,"When I was in middle school, I think, my sister told me to following anorexic tips for weight loss tips since I obviously wouldn’t develop anorexia.

196,"TW: Brief mention of self-harm  I've been in treatment since March, back and forth from PHP and IOP. I'm currently doing virtual IOP due to COVID. I've experienced a lot of technical difficulties and I've missed two dietitian appointments  because I easily forget when everything is virtual. Less than two weeks ago I had to go to the ER because of a self-harm wound. My outpatient therapist very suddenly had to move out of state without warning so now I need to find a new one and she was the only eating disorder therapist around that took my insurance so I'll probably have to go out of network. Also the therapist for my IOP group has had PTO the last two weeks so I haven't gotten to talk to her either.  I was trying to connect to the meeting today and it wouldn't let me so I mossed like half of it and my dietician made some stupid comment about me ""avoiding treatment"" and it really fucking hurt. She has barely talked to me in two weeks so she has no idea what's been going on and her default conclusion is that I must be full of shit. She also said ""we might be looking at a discharge soon"" like what the fuck?  This happened to me in PHP too. They threatened to discharge me when I wasn't ""making enough progress"" and said that I ""clearly wasn't interested in recovery."" I had only been in recovery for like 2 months. I mentioned that I'd tried weed once as an attempt at a coping mechanism in the past and next thing I know they were drug testing me and accusing me of using synthetic urine when it came back clean??? I don't understand this type of attitude coming from people working in mental health.  I'm so sick of it. I want to recover but this isn't fucking helping.

200,"I have been struggling with body dysmorphia and anorexia for years now. I’m 22 and the intrusive thoughts started when I was 11. It has sucked so badly and I’ve cried multiple times a week over the fact that I have hated my body and could never just exist as I am. It has always felt like Ana has been in the back of my head just screaming at me to stop eating. Stop eating. Stop EATING.   A few weeks ago I hit a dark place I’ve never been at before.   TW for self harm and ED talk   I’m not sure if you remember, but a few weeks ago I posted about how I woke up to find stretch marks on my stomach. They had appeared over night and I’ve never had stretch marks there before in my whole life.   I relapsed on my anorexia and only ended up eating three meals over an entire week. After that week, I fell hard. I then relapsed on my self harm. I carved up my stomach directly over the stretch marks, completely obscuring them. I was sitting in the bath tub, bleeding and crying and hating myself.   And then she just stopped. Ana stopped screaming at me.   I was dizzy from the blood loss and the lack of food in my system, but I got myself cleaned up, bandaged myself up, did my makeup, got dressed, and went to work.   Ever since then, things have been turning around. I’ve been eating everything I want to eat without feeling nearly as much guilt. If I do feel guilt, it’s much easier to dismiss. I’ve also been doing physical activities (hiking, long walks), but for pleasure, and not as a means of punishing myself and/or trying to lose weight. I can look at myself naked and not cry. I feel good.   Ana is still there, but she isn’t screaming anymore. She speaks more in a whisper, faintly hoping she can catch me in a bad moment. Don’t get me wrong, not every second is perfect and she still gets to me sometimes, but she no longer occupies my every waking moment.   I am by NO MEANS advocating for self harm or any form of self destruction as a means of achieving clarity and relief. This was an uncontrollable action that resulted from a deep place of self loathing and an inconsolable longing for an end to the pain. Please do not do this in the hopes of it changing your mindset.   This is what happened to me. My stomach is healing now and life is looking up. I’m now dedicated to self betterment instead of oppressive destruction of my body. I’m no longer listening to Ana and her restrictive deadlines. Slow and steady physical betterment for the sake of improved health, energy, and wellbeing is what I strive for now.   I never thought I would reach a point where I was okay with how I am.

Alright, fortunately not diabulimia) since I was 14 and since then have toppled back and forth between an underweight and healthy BMI. I finally thought I had settled on recovery after two years of generally not engaging in behaviors and maintaining my weight. I stopped weighing myself a year ago and I literally no longer cared about my weight.  Then BOOM! I go to buy jeans and they don’t quite fit. Not entirely sized out, but like, definitely different. So I did it. I weighed myself.  Woooo boy. Ya girl gaint.  Nothing mind boggling to the average person, and the weight is healthy and pretty safely distant from either end of the spectrum. But this is a weight I promised I’d kill myself immediately at if I got to it. Not gonna do that, though.  It’s the little victories.  But ya girl sure isn’t eating dinner 👁 👄 👁 I have already been eating healthy foods but I was like, more focused on eating whole foods and hitting nutrient goals (just like my ortho days but fat 💕). So I’m probably gonna keep doing that, just OMAD it midday and hope I don’t faint at my job.  It’s funny how much denial kicks in for so long without tangible data though because?? like most days I wasn’t agonizing about being fat like I used to. I was impressed by the muscle I gained at work albeit a little upset with the ratio of my thighs to everything else but I also thought I looked petite most days (spoiler: she’s not).  So yeah...

202,"I'm here as an 18 year old. Turned 18 a week ago. But now, I'm ready to give up so so badly. I'm still in HS and on the tail end of my senior year. I got accepted into university, but none of that matters now. I'll admit. Living with my ED isn't easy. Fights over mealtimes have occurred. I've badgered my mother in the past over portion sizes and exercise is a battle.   I almost got kicked out on Wednesday/Thursday. Got my phone confiscated for calling some hotlines and trying to get some advice. I get my laptop confiscated at night. Strangely enough, my parents have stopped yelling at me but the words that they use might as well be worse than yelled insults. In the past, I got reported for some posts online and that's how I got police at my door due to the internet use but that hasn't happened in months. I've started paying for my portion of the phone line as well. I'm just... ready to honestly give up,  My parents tell me that I'm to cut my hours at work because it requires me to be at home. To cap my hours at 20 hours per week. Then they want me to be out of the house from 8 am to 7 pm because they need to protect their physical health by not seeing me in the house. Dad says that he's getting symptoms of a precursor to a stroke/heart attack because of high blood pressure as well as things like shoulder/neck paralysis whenever he has to deal with or talk to me. He says my mother has some stomach issues due to the stress of dealing with me and my mental/physical health issues for 5-6 years.   Over the years, they've threatened to kick me out of the house since I was 7-8 years old. They don't bat an eye when my sister says she's had suicidal thoughts for over a year. Physical punishments happened when I was younger. Name calling. Just constantly being told that there's no way they could be abusive because of how much money they spend trying to clothe, feed, and educate us.   This time... I just want to give up completely.

Been weight restored for a long time and have considered myself in active recovery from my original diagnosis of EDNOS many years ago. I remember at the time I was so frustrated with my doctor mentioning it was likely EDNOS and not anorexia because I felt like she was implying something about me (I understand how irrational this is now but my ED brain was freaking out).   Anyways, present day, probably six or so years later, I’m checking my charts and medical history after a non-ed related appointment and see that my original diagnosis WAS for anorexia nervosa. I’m just sitting here laughing because those words would have meant so much to me at the time but in the context of my life now, they mean almost nothing. I’m freaking out about other health issues but I’m so glad I’m not dealing with them on top of an active ED (no matter what it’s officially labeled in my charts).

And of course depends on face type but I think mine could do it. We're still in real life description, hold on, I will tell you when the dream begins. Anyway, lately I have reached a LW since my latest relapse. Idk if I had the corner ever before, I never focussed on it. And now I can feel it being sharp and pointy, and I can see that it's so close to becoming really visible. I'm so excited about it. Side note: I'm trying to weigh myself less regular because it just drives me nuts.  So, my dream was that I had in fact lost all the weight until said bmi.

212,"Don’t have anyone to tell this to but I got my period last night I’m feeling really weird about it.   I lost my period when I was 17 and now I’m in my early 20s. In 2019 I gained ~12 pounds (still ~7-8 below a minimum healthy BMI) and I’ve mostly been maintaining since August. In February, I had a minor existential crisis over some spotting and last night my period came back full-swing.   I don’t know how I feel about it. When I was at my worst roughly 3 years ago, I used to swear I’d end it all if I ever got my period back. Of course I don’t feel that way now. Last night I even felt a certain sense of relief, like, that’s what I was afraid of for so long. There are so many awful things going on in the world right now that it seems so inconsequential. I feel selfish it ever mattered.  Still, part of me is mad at my body for “acting fat” even though I’m not, and terrified this means I don’t have the right to consider myself disordered anymore. I would never think this about anyone else, so I don’t know why I have to be so harsh on myself. I can feel my exercise addiction kicking in again (I managed to cut it about 25% last year!) and I’m guessing things will be downhill from here, especially as a national quarantine seems imminent, but I want to take a moment to appreciate the fact that I’m probably the healthiest I’ve ever been.

215,"**There will be brief mentions of restriction and childhood abuse ahead. Please don't read on if you're not in a place to handle that right now.** Please also note that this post is very stupid and I'm honestly embarrassed that it hurt me enough that I felt the need to make a post about it.   So, look. We all know which sub I'm talking about. I won't name it because I don't want to encourage brigading and also it is totally within their rights for them to enforce any rule they see fit. I understand why they've done this, especially considering the amount of heat they get from subs like these. But - one of the most popular 'dieting lifestyle' subs, or whatever you want to call it, banned people with a history of eating disorders today. They have categorically stated that we're not welcome and will be permabanned if we have a post history that mentions having an eating disorder.   I know most people here hate that sub. I know many people who have only ever had a restrictive disorder feel some kind of way about it and I totally respect that. If that is the case, you may want to dip out here. I loved that sub and I genuinely believe it saved my life.   I'll skip the novel, but the cliff notes version is that I was neglected and abused in many ways throughout my childhood. I got out lacking some very basic self care skills. I was diagnosed with anorexia pretty young. I attempted to recover without any real professional help and went on to develop bulimia instead. I had no idea how moderation worked - I'm an all or nothing type of guy. I was never taught about nutrition, portion control, food groups, when to eat, how much to eat, when to stop, what counts as binging, what counts as restriction. When I developed bulimia my life spiralled and my health took a very sudden turn for the worst. My days revolved around food and guilt and misery.    I discovered **that** lifestyle by accident, and with it I discovered **that** sub. I swear to you that shit saved my life. I lurked for years, never really contributed a lot, and I'm not sure if I ever even posted there on this account. But that lifestyle saved me and gave me the skills to keep me afloat. I know that attracts a lot of eye rolls from people who say that lifestyle is impossible for someone with an ED to maintain safely, but it taught me *actual* self control, not the bullshit anorexic version I had before.   It taught me how to take care of myself by setting reasonable boundaries - introducing boundaries to my life was a genuine act of self love and turned shit around for me both in terms of eating and other acts of excess. That lifestyle taught me how to reduce and eventually cut out binging entirely - because I knew when to eat and when not to. It was as simple as that and it sounds stupid but I was literally never taught that. Through that community I found out a lot of the basics like how much you should be eating in the first place. It also taught me that you don't go on restricting indefinitely - that you *can* end your restriction and it *isn't* a failure. It can be a positive thing and it's a healthy cycle when done correctly.   Now, granted, I've relapsed and I currently restrict unhealthily once again. But that has more to do with my current personal circumstances. It has nothing to do with that lifestyle - I stepped away from it when I relapsed because to me it was healthy and a relapse is not healthy.   Anyway. It is so ***incredibly*** stupid to feel hurt by this and I know it. Mods there said themselves it isn't their job to parent us - and I respect that. It just hurts because in a lot of ways, I did feel very safe browsing over there. I did learn skills I should have learned from parents. I do feel hurt from this that is definitely disproportionate. When I read that we were unwelcome there it genuinely physically hurt me for a second which is such a stupid reaction. I've just lost something that meant a lot to me - which is stupid because I only ever lurked anyway.   It feels like I've got to genuinely mourn the fact that I'm not welcome in the first place that gave me stability with my eating. It was the first time I ever thought about recovery and it was the first time I ever got to a point where I was genuinely in control. It hurts to have that place make an enemy of people like me when it was such a positive thing for me.   Look, I'm so sorry to have made a post like this and it's honestly embarrassing that I felt the need to make this. I feel a little better just from explaining why I felt hurt by something that seems so stupid. It just hit me pretty hard in a way I wasn't expecting. It probably isn't about the sub - it's probably deeper than that and I should raise these feelings with my therapist. Obviously, not the job of anyone on the internet to accommodate anything or anyone they don't want to, and I take responsibility for these immature feelings - this isn't the fault of anyone over on that sub, this is entirely on me.   I just wanted to share these feelings with a group who might understand them in some way. On the positive side, I can still take away those coping mechanisms and skills I learned from that sub and implement them in my future recovery. I haven't lost any of the skills I learned in my time there. I hope anyone else who felt some kind of way about that post is doing okay.
