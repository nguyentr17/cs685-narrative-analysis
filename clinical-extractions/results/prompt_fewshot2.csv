0,0,EatingDisorders,"23 F. I just started treatment for an eating disorder of 4+ years and I feel really down on myself. I am basically on a liquid diet and it makes ""nutritional value"" a lot easier, considering the small snacks I was eating before had no real value in them. the problem is since i started drinking the ""boost"" drinks my therapist recommended, ive been loosing weight. this is scary because i don't really have much weight to loose, and I feel really freaked out because im trying to gain weight and get better, and i feel full after drinking 2 of them a day. i dont know what to do and i feel like my life is spinning out of control. I want to get better and I want to be healthy but I feel like im going in the wrong direction. Does anyone have any advice for what to do? I'm in my last semester of college and I don't really have time for inpatient. im sorry if this is triggering im really scared and i want to get better and i really just want to be okay and healthy.",,I need moral support,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10poqxu,1,GullibleCup27,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10poqxu/i_need_moral_support/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10poqxu/i_need_moral_support/,1675140001,191,0,0,0,-1,1,"Starting treatment for an eating disorder, consuming a liquid diet recommended by therapist",harmful,"['Weight loss despite attempts to gain weight and get better', 'Feeling full after drinking only 2 drinks a day', 'Feeling scared and out of control about the direction of their recovery']","Starting treatment for an eating disorder, being on a liquid diet, drinking ""boost"" drinks recommended by therapist.",harmful,"['Feeling down and scared because she is losing weight instead of gaining weight', 'Feeling full after 2 drinks a day', 'In her last semester of college and does not have time for inpatient']"
1,1,EatingDisorders,"I 26 f told the truth for the first time about my eating disorder to my boyfriend. We've been together for almost 7 years now. I've been bulimic since I was a child. The first time i purge was around when i was 12. I've been dealing with this alone my whole life. You know how it is, my ed consume my life in so many ways. Lately it's been particularly difficult, I don't have a nice life for many reasons that I'm not gonna explain here, because even though this is anonymous I'm not ready to talk about it. 
I find extremely difficult to talk about my problems, I usually bottles up everything. 
I didn't eat for the last 3 days. I've quit smoking 2.5 years ago and today smoked 6 cigarettes. Half an hour ago I was with my boyfriend and, I don't know fucking why I told him everything. I guess bc I need someone to cares, I would like to someone give a crap about what happens to me. I talk for about 10 minutes, trying to explain it and how i think i need help, and then i noticed he fell sleep while I was talking. 
I can't go to therapy, I'm unemployed. I really can't count with my family or the few friends I have.
This... I don't know. I want to give up on everything. I don't need advice, I know I need to seek help, but like I've explained, isn't possible, believe me. 
I don't care about me and clearly no one cares about me either. I don't know why I keep trying everyday. ,",,Opening up about my ed,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10pnoxo,1,mistinthrowaway,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pnoxo/opening_up_about_my_ed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pnoxo/opening_up_about_my_ed/,1675137504,273,0,0,0,-1,1,"Difficulty in finding support from family and friends, lack of financial resources to seek therapy or treatment",harmful,"['Difficulty opening up about their eating disorder to their partner but received a negative response and felt like their boyfriend didn’t care', 'Loss of motivation and feeling like there is no support or care from those around them']",Lack of emotional support and inability to afford therapy,harmful,"['Person has been struggling with bulimia since childhood but has been dealing with it alone', 'Opening up about their eating disorder to their boyfriend made them feel vulnerable and in need of help', 'Boyfriend fell asleep while they were talking about it, causing them to feel invalidated and uncared for']"
2,4,EatingDisorders,"Idk who to talk to about this so I resort to reddit.

I have been struggling a lot. I went to a party this weekend I threw up as soon as I had drank or ate anything. I threw up three times that night. It wasn't from the alcohol. I think my habits have just been destroying my stomach. I go through periods where I feel like can't stop eating and then a flip will switch and I can't even think about eating without feeling disgusting and nauseous. My stomach has hurt a lot more frequently and I get constant dizzy spells. I can't even think about getting dinner without crying. I also think that one of my friends are basically bragging about their eating disorder and it's triggering me to be worse.",,Just ranting ig,1,,,,,,t5_2qpcj,10pjinj,1,tomato_bean876,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pjinj/just_ranting_ig/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pjinj/just_ranting_ig/,1675126245,133,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,,,
3,5,EatingDisorders,"I don’t know where to start.. Due to my upbringing, my eating disorder was inevitable. It’s been almost 6 years of constant torture, but dieting and tummy pinching go way back into my childhood.

I just don’t feel like I will ever recover. There are times I LOVE my disorder and will not stop no matter what happens to me. But then there are times like this, where I just feel numb. The numbers drop yet I don’t feel anything. My mind feels constantly tormented by food 24/7, although the only time I feel calm is when I’m empty.

So I just want to know if true recovery is even possible? Or will the rest of my life feel like a constant battle.. it’s feels like the latter the longer this continues.",,Is true recovery possible?,1,,seeking support,,,,t5_2qpcj,10pj90n,1,Clikrean,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pj90n/is_true_recovery_possible/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10pj90n/is_true_recovery_possible/,1675125516,132,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,,,
4,8,EatingDisorders,"i abused laxatives/purging/starving and now every single time i eat i will get the hiccups, this can be anywhere from 2 minutes to 7 whole hours. its making recovery SO hard. the involuntary movements hurt my ribcage, it feels like i’m being punished for eating. i did it to myself. recovery feels useless now. pls don’t get to the point i’m at because you will regret it and think back at every day of your life when you didn’t have this. i can’t play guitar properly anymore if i eat bc i will constantly hiccup against my guitar, my hiccups move my whole chest. it makes any form of exercise hard. people who don’t know my hiccups are chronic laugh when i get them and try to scare them away as a joke etc. this is not the life you want to live. this is both a vent and a warning post. any supportive messages are welcome i’m going through a really rough time so please keep anything nasty to yourself",,i get “chronic” hiccups due to bulimia (take this as a warning),1,,,,,,t5_2qpcj,10perl4,1,glitterkittygirl,,/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10perl4/i_get_chronic_hiccups_due_to_bulimia_take_this_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/10perl4/i_get_chronic_hiccups_due_to_bulimia_take_this_as/,1675114462,171,0,0,0,-1,1,,,,,,
