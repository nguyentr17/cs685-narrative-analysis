I started going to a nutritionist last November and when I started going I was eating max 2 meals a day and purging routinely. But throughout this process it been so frustrating to find articles and stuff about people who restrict eating and purge. I feel like I am all alone. I hear about people who restrict and people who binge eat because that's what gets all the attention when talk about eating disorders. Given I can't even say disorder out loud, but it'd make me feel less alone if I could put myself into some category that wasn't as vague as 'disordered eating' or 'purging disorder' because I feel like the description of purging disorder j talks about purging and not restricting. Also when you read stuff about eating disorders online and talk to people about it nobody ever talks about how FLUID it is. Like I used to purge a lot a lot and then I tried to help myself by stopping and I just started restricting what I eat even more. IT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE!! Also recently I realized that my favorite part of drinking is coming home and throwing up because the best part about it is that I'm not 'purging' NO I'M PULLING TRIG its fun like what ever. But im beginning to realize that its really reflecting purging behavior because I won't have even drunk that much and I won't feel sick but I'll make myself do it anyways bc its kinda socially more acceptable than purging and I can convince myself that its not. And the worse part about it is that I've been telling my nutritionist that I haven't been purging bc I didn't count it right and I was really starting to feel like I was making a comeback but no I've been making myself throw up at least twice a month most months. I go to look online about correlations between drinking and purging disorder and I can't find any and it makes me feel so alone. Who am I supposed to talk to? I don't feel like I can talk to them bc I don't want to trigger them bc u never know what someones dealing with and the only people I know who like talk about their eating disorders are bulimic or anorexic and I know that this is all so personal and I don't want to trigger anyone. But rn it j feels like there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I'm eating 3 meals a day but each ones a struggle. I can't even tell my parents how much I'm struggling bc im so embarrassed. They're the ones sending me to the nutritionist but they think I'm going to talk her about sports nutrition.\\n\\n\",\n",

The medication really helps me to manage impulses surrounding binging. \\n\\nIt also completely erases my appetite, but I'm making the effort to have multiple healthy meals every day so I'm not accidentally starving myself. So far it's been one solid month and I've lost around 10lbs! That sounds like a lot, but my starting weight was 315lbs, so this needs to happen for my health and wellness. Looking forward to getting into the 200s again\\n\\n    {'factors': 'taking Concerta for ADHD', 'effect_details': ['helps manage impulses surrounding binging', 'reduces appetite', 'lost around 10lbs in one month', 'making the effort to have multiple healthy meals every day'], 'effect_type': 'helpful'}\\n\\n    Narrative: “I told myself two days ago no more doordash because I can't afford it and well, obviously, binging. Today I had a bad day, and I wanted chick fil a, but, as much as it was screaming inside me, I didn't get fries. Only chicken. So I successfully stayed within my limit today. I still had food out but...progress right?”\\n\\n    {'factors': 'Making a conscious effort to avoid binging and staying within limits', 'effect_details': ['Successfully resisting the urge to get fries despite craving Chick-fil-A', 'Acknowledging progress towards making healthier food choices'], 'effect_type': 'helpful'}\\n\\n    Narrative: I have a girlfriend who's recovering. She had a baby last year and per her mom, it really bothers her if people call her baby chunky or chubby or comment on baby's fat leg rolls. Also she took like one photo of herself while pregnant. Now I'm not in the ED community or anything similar so I DO NOT want to upset or offend anyone but I just think this is ludicrous. I personally loved seeing pix of my mother glowing and pregnant with me. And babies ARE beautifully wonderfully perfectly chubby! I just don't understand at all but I'm not gonna say this to her. Just wondering if this is typical? Again I'm sorry if my thoughts on this upset you - that's not my intention.\\n\\n    {'factors': 'negative comments on baby's weight', 'effect_details': ['upsetting and triggering for the girlfriend who is recovering from an eating disorder'], 'effect_type': 'harmful'}\\n    \\n\\n Narrative: I'm overweight because I love binge eating. But sometimes I hate that I binge eat so I purge. But sometimes I love purging so I don't even have to binge to do it. But then I hate that I'm purging so I restrict. But I can't restrict forever and I hate feeling full so I start restricting and purging. Except those days where I eat relatively normally, but now I have energy so I start exercising. And I can handle more and more every day. And I'm making progress, but not enough.\\n\\nSo I start restricting again. But I'm still exercising. But I still feel too full so I start purging again, even though I'm still exercising. And after a while I have a day where I'm so starved that I binge. And then purge. And the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnd I start to eat things that aren't food. I'm eating my fingernails, bits of paper (hardback book paper tastes best), pen caps... And I purge that too, because anything being in your stomach for too long is obviously poison. \\n\\nI'm just struggling and ranting. Someone suggested this sub as one where people might understand.\\n\\n\"]"
